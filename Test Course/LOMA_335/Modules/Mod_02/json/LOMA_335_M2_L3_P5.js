An employee could express his concerns publicly if he feels unfairly treated or compensated, or if he identifies unethical business practices. Even if he addresses his concerns privately (for example, through email), those concerns could end up in the public domain. If fear or resentment among employees goes unaddressed, a negative company culture could come across in employees’ online presences or former employees’ reviews. As a result, customers today have access to a company’s internal culture. Companies can use this to their advantage: it creates the opportunity to strengthen brand and operations simultaneously. A company with a reputation for a positive internal culture will garner greater respect and, ultimately, more customer loyalty."
