For example, not all snakes are harmful to people, but most people need additional information to distinguish between poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes. Since people rarely have the time to stop and do research when they encounter a snake, avoiding all snakes is a good heuristic for most people. As illustrated in this example, <em>not</em> following the heuristic often carries greater risk than following it."

Such information may be presented either cooperatively or competitively by members of the decision-making group.

In such situations, contested issues turn into a power struggle, with each side seeking to “win” and have the group accept its view as the right view.

As a result, big-bet decisions often include a formal position known as a devil’s advocate.

The devil’s advocate should operate independently of the group and have no personal stake in the ultimate outcome of the group’s decision. Members of the decision-making team should understand that the role of the devil’s advocate is to make them focus on negative information and to help them develop and present the strongest possible case for proceeding with a particular decision. Another approach for gathering dissenting opinions is to require that a decision-making team prepare a minority report that presents contrarian opinions and facts."

Although certainty does exist in the business world, decision makers spend most of their time making decisions in conditions of risk and uncertainty. Decision makers view risk and uncertainty on a continuum. The least risky situations are when a decision maker has incomplete but reliable information and is able to assign a reliable individual probability to each possibility. At the other end of the continuum is true uncertainty, where little or no reliable information is available, and the decision maker is unable to assign individual probabilities because one or more outcomes are unknown."

He suggests looking at the decision process separately from the decision’s outcome to determine if anything should have been done differently.
