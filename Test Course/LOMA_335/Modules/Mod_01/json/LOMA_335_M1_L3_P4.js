Rewards need to incorporate extrinsic and intrinsic elements when possible to motivate high performance. Pay and benefits—examples of extrinsic rewards—do affect motivation in that people who are not paid adequately feel less motivated to perform at high levels. However, studies show that pay and benefits do not significantly enhance performance once employees achieve a certain minimum level of pay and benefits. For such employees, incorporating elements into a job that promote feelings of competency, relatedness, and autonomy often do enhance employee performance. For example, a company might see performance improve when employees are encouraged to spend an hour each week with coworkers on a special project of their own choosing or provide access to training and education programs that will improve competencies."
