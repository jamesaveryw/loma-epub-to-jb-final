Govindarajan cautions that such companies need to manage their present business for profitability but always be looking to the future. To ensure continued success, Govindarajan recommends that companies let go of attitudes and assumptions that might fuel current business but interfere with future innovation. Box 2 requires companies to discontinue activities or even lines of business that might be successful today but are unlikely to be successful in the future because some aspect of the environment is changing. Box 2 requires difficult and often painful decisions. Box 3 is where a company’s future lies. Focusing the company’s attention on new ideas and innovations allows companies to create new products and business models that take advantage of new or emerging technologies. Box 3 represents how a company remains relevant in the future."
