Research has shown that not all workers desire or are motivated by all five characteristics. The challenge for management is to match employees to jobs with suitable core job dimensions. Millennials, in general, tend to value autonomy more than older baby boomers. In addition, employees’ needs for various core job dimensions change during a career. For example, a new employee who needs guidance is not motivated by high levels of autonomy when starting a job. Note also that these features are not necessarily objective. For example, our assembly-line worker found higher task significance in her job once she realized the importance of her work to the car’s safety. Thus, a manager might potentially increase the motivating aspects of routine jobs by tying a job’s importance to a larger objective or mission that might not be evident to the employee. For example, a claims representative might not understand the importance of reviewing beneficiary signatures with the signatures on claims until the manager explains how claim fraud negatively effects beneficiaries receiving their benefits promptly and the company’s financial performance."

Employers also can benefit from lower overhead costs and improved morale and productivity. Dozens of studies indicate that telecommuting can boost productivity, job performance, and job satisfaction.

Remote workers face unique challenges in that they do nothave the same resources available to them as in-office employees. For example,remote workers may be required to trouble shoot their own technology problems.In addition, remote workers can find it difficult to form supportive relationshipswith other employees, and to collaborate on work projects. For these reasons,not every person is a good fit for remote work. Remote workers need goodorganizational skills, good communication skills, technological knowledge,and the ability to focus in the presence of distractions in order to worksuccessfully away from the office."
