In a typical performance evaluation process, employee goals are set at the beginning of the appraisal period—a type of steering control. During the evaluation period, the evaluator and employee meet to review progress toward these goals—a type of concurrent control. Then, at the end of the year, the evaluator conducts a formal appraisal—a type of feedback control. Performance evaluation is necessary for management to make decisions about compensation, promotions, transfers, and terminations."

A compensation package of pay and benefits is necessary to attract and retain the most qualified and talented employees and to maintain or increase the level of employee performance. To develop an attractive compensation package, insurance companies first determine what other insurers and companies in other industries are providing to their employees.
