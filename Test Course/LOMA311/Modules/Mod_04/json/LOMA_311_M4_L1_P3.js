Although many insurers are attempting to streamline the underwriting process, the process can take several weeks, and many applicants pay the initial premium so that their coverage can begin before the underwriting and policy issue processes are completed. The advantage to the insurer and the financial professional is that an applicant who has paid the initial premium is more likely to accept the policy when it is delivered than is an applicant who has not paid the initial premium."

A temporary insurance agreement is a contract between the insurer and the life insurance applicant. The contract is formed when the financial professional—who is acting as an authorized agent of the insurer—makes an offer to provide temporary insurance coverage if the applicant pays the initial premium. The applicant accepts the insurer’s offer by paying that premium, and the temporary insurance agreement is then effective."
