When an insurer establishes reserves for a block of guaranteed insurance policies, it knows the total face value of the block of policies and, thus, its future obligation to its customers. However, the insurer can only estimate the amount of investment earnings on the portion of policy premiums it actually invests. In addition, the insurer does not know precisely when a customer or beneficiary will submit a claim on the policy or if a policy will lapse before benefit payments become due. Because of such uncertainties, insurers must estimate the amounts to report in their reserve accounts. These assumed values used in a life insurance or an annuity product design are called <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">actuarial assumptions</span>. In product design, insurers make assumptions with respect to many factors, such as future mortality rates, investment earnings, expenses, surrenders, and lapses."
