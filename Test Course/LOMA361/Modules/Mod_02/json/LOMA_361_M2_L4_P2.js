Instead, these capital gains and losses are reflected in the AVR and the IMR. These two reserves act as a buffer for the insurer’s capital and surplus, causing capital and surplus to be affected only gradually by capital gains and losses. Thus, these reserves help to ensure the stability of an insurer’s capital and surplus accounts."
