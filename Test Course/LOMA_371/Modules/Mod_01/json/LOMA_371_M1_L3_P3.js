These risks are unlike the traditional financial risks insurers are accustomed to managing, such as credit risk and market risk. With the evolving nature of risk, each life insurance company must be able to create a comprehensive list of all of its key risk exposures, including emerging nonfinancial risks. To classify risks on that list, the insurer needs a <em>risk taxonomy</em>. For this course’s purposes, we define a <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">risk taxonomy</span> as the classification and aggregation of all risks across an organization based on each risk’s core, defining characteristics."
