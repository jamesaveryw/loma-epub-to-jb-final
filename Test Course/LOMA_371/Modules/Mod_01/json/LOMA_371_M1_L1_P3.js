In this way, a company establishes a <em>risk management culture</em>. The advantage of a strong risk management culture is that every employee is aware of his or her role in the company’s risk management efforts, and, therefore, can work more effectively toward the company’s goals.

This tolerance is usually expressed as a company’s stated limits on risk-taking in specified categories.
