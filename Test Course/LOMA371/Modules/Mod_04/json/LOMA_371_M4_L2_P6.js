Under this option, the number of periodic payments is based on the lifetime of the annuitant. The insurer makes regular payments from the beginning of the payout period until the annuitant’s death, after which the company ceases payments. Thus, a single life annuity is the most basic form of a life annuity. For a single life annuity, an insurer calculates the cost of annuity payments over a period extending to the end of the mortality table—for example, to age 120—rather than for a specified number of years."

Then, insurers multiply the result by the appropriate mortality factor to determine the number of annuitants still living at the end of the year. Next, they multiply the amount of each periodic payment by the number of surviving annuitants. The sum of the resulting values is the cost for one year for a block of contracts."

The mortality margin introduces an element of conservatism into the design by increasing the assumed survivorship rates, thereby increasing the estimated number of payments the insurer will make. If the actual mortality rate among the product’s annuitants is higher than expected, the product is likely to be more profitable than projected because of the lower cost of periodic income payments.
