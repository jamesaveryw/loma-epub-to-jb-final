Although laws vary somewhat from state to state, we describe some of the general principles of tort law found in the laws of most states. Virtually all countries provide remedies to those who are injured by another person’s wrongful (tortious) actions as described in this section."

To reduce the harshness of this rule, most states have modified their laws by adapting a system of <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">comparative negligence</span>, which apportions losses between plaintiffs and defendants when both parties’ negligence contributed to a plaintiff’s losses. With comparative negligence, a plaintiff who was contributorily negligent may recover from the defendant, but the amount of that recovery is reduced in proportion to the plaintiff’s fault. For example, assume that the trier of fact determines that a plaintiff was 20 percent at fault for her losses and the defendant was 80 percent at fault. The defendant will be held liable to the plaintiff for 80 percent of her losses. In some states, comparative negligence laws allow a plaintiff to recover from the defendant only if the defendant was 50 percent or more, or in other states more than 50 percent, at fault."
