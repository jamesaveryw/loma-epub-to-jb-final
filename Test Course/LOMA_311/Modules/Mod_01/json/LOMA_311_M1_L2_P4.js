This categorization results from the way that England’s common law courts developed remedies. Originally, English courts followed rigid, formalized procedures that provided only limited and specific remedies, which came to be known as <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">legal remedies</span>. These remedies primarily involved the payment of money damages to injured parties. Over time, legal remedies were inadequate to remedy some wrongs. The English government established separate courts, known as <em>courts of equity </em>or sometimes as<em> chancery courts</em>, to provide new remedies. The courts of equity were not bound by the existing rigid procedures and were given discretionary power to base their decisions on moral rights and concepts of justice. The remedies developed by the equity courts were known as <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">equitable remedies</span>. Today, the courts in common law jurisdictions are empowered to grant both legal and equitable remedies, although they may be separated into law and chancery divisions. We discuss remedies available to the parties to a life insurance contract in Chapter 13. "

The purpose of a punitive damage award is to punish the defendant and to deter others from similar conduct. For instance, a court may award punitive damages in intentional tort cases and occasionally in cases based on negligence. An example of an intentional tort that might result in punitive damages for an insurer is fraudulent misrepresentation, such as if an insurer were to commit fraud by selling a policy under false claims. Punitive damages generally are <em>not</em> available in actions based on breach of contract unless the breach was wanton, willful, and deliberate."

In such cases, the plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory damages, because she failed to prove the amount of her damages with reasonable certainty. If the defendant’s conduct was wrongful, however, the trier of fact may award the plaintiff a small sum. For example, assume that the defendant trespassed on the plaintiff’s land but did not damage the plaintiff in any measurable way.

The basic purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment: A person should not be allowed to profit or be enriched as a result of a wrong committed at the expense of another person. Restitution is available in civil actions in which it is more appropriate to restore to the plaintiff what the defendant received than to award damages in the amount of the plaintiff’s losses. For example, assume that a person overpays an amount owed to another. The party who receives such an overpayment would be unjustly enriched if she keeps the amount overpaid and, thus, may be ordered to repay that amount. Similarly, the court would commonly order a person who wrongfully takes the property of another to return the property to its owner."
