However, the legal effect of a contract entered into by an agent on behalf of the principal depends in part on the contractual capacity of the principal. For a contract entered into by an agent to be valid and binding on the principal, the principal must have contractual capacity. For example, if a minor appoints an agent who enters into a contract for non-necessaries on the minor’s behalf, the contract is voidable by the minor. Likewise, a principal who has been judicially declared insane lacks contractual capacity. Any contracts that an agent tries to create on behalf of such a principal generally are void."
