Parol evidence may be oral evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses concerning the negotiations leading up to the contract, or it may be written evidence, such as letters or memoranda."

With this rule in force, one party cannot subsequently try to change the terms of the agreement to her advantage. The rule applies only when the parties entered into a valid written contract and intended the writing to contain their entire agreement. In other words, if the writing is clear, definite, and complete, the law presumes that the parties reduced their entire agreement to that writing. Thus, parol evidence is not admissible to add to, vary, or contradict the writing. The rule, however, does not prevent the introduction of evidence that is intended to prove that no contract was formed. For example, the defendant has the right to introduce evidence that the contract was illegal and void or was entered into under duress."

In such cases, the court will enforce the contract as written and will exclude parol evidence that contradicts the written contract. Parol evidence, however, is admissible to aid a court in interpreting a written contract that is unclear. For example, the parties are allowed to introduce evidence to explain the meaning of technical terms and terms that have a special trade meaning or a special meaning in the locality where the contract was completed."
