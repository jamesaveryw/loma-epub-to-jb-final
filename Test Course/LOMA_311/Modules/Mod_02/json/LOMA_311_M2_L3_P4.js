For example, a testator may revoke a will by executing a subsequent valid will. A testator may also revise a valid will by executing a <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">codicil</span>, which is a testamentary document that supplements a will. Because it is a testamentary document, a codicil must be executed with the same formalities that are required to execute a valid will. A testator can use a codicil to add to the provisions of a will, to revoke or alter provisions, and to explain or qualify provisions. For example, a testator may use a codicil to dispose of property she acquired after she executed her will."

The purpose of intestate succession laws is to distribute the intestate’s property in a manner that closely represents how the average person would have passed on his property had that person created a will.
