Whether the requirement is met in a given case is a question of fact. Note that the insurable interest must exist only at the time of contracting and is not required to continue throughout the life of the policy. For example, if a person purchases a life insurance policy on the life of his spouse, the policy remains a valid contract even if the couple later divorces. If a business owner purchases key-person insurance on a key employee, the owner could choose to continue the contract if the employee later left the business. Insurable interest is also not required to continue in the case of a viatical settlement, a transaction that we discuss in Chapter 12."
