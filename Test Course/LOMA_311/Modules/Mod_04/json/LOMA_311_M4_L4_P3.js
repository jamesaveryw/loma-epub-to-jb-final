A warranty that is not <em>literally</em> true gives an injured party grounds to avoid the contract. In the past, the doctrine of warranties sometimes resulted in unjust results when applied to life insurance. For example, assume that an applicant for life insurance said that she had visited a doctor for treatment of a toe on her <em>left</em> foot when in fact the visit was for treatment of a toe on her <em>right</em> foot. Under the doctrine of warranties, the insurer had grounds to rescind the contract even though the error was not material to the insurance and thus would not have affected the insurer’s decision to issue the policy. Laws throughout the United States now specify that, in the absence of fraud, statements made in life insurance applications are representations and not warranties."

A representation can be used to invalidate the contract if the statement is not <em>substantially</em> true and the statement induced the other party to enter into the contract. In other words, if a party misrepresents a fact that is material to the insurance, the contract is voidable by the other party. A misrepresentation is considered to be material to the insurance when the insurer—if it had known the truth—would have evaluated the proposed risk differently. Generally, a misrepresentation is material if the insurer with knowledge of the true facts would have taken any of the following actions with regard to the policy: (1) declined to issue, (2) increased the premium rate, or (3) excluded coverage for certain risks."

Note that when an insurer takes action because of a misstatement of age or sex, the insurer is enforcing the policy’s misstatement of age or sex provision. Such an action by the insurer is <em>not</em> considered a contest to the validity of the contract and is not prohibited by the incontestability provision, which we discuss in the next section. As Video 13.1 illustrates, when a proposed insured makes a misrepresentation regarding age or sex on an application for life insurance, the insurer’s action—as specified in the policy—depends on when the misstatement is discovered."
