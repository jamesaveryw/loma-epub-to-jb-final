In both situations, the lender controls the legal title to the automobile.

This prohibition is the primary difference between a spendthrift trust and other trusts; most states permit the beneficiaries of other types of trusts to assign their interest in the trust. Thus, for example, a trust beneficiary can assign her interest in a trust as collateral for a loan. By prohibiting such assignments or other transfers of an interest in spendthrift trust property, a spendthrift trust protects the trust property from the trust beneficiary’s actions. In addition, state laws generally prohibit creditors from seizing the property in a spendthrift trust. After trust assets are transferred to the trust beneficiary, however, those assets can be seized by the beneficiary’s creditors. Later in the chapter, we describe how life insurance policyowners can use a spendthrift trust to protect a policy’s beneficiary."

In addition, the trustee generally is given full discretion in handling the trust assets. In most states, the settlor of a spendthrift trust cannot also be a trust beneficiary. A few states, however, now permit a person to establish a spendthrift trust and name himself as the trust beneficiary if certain requirements are met."
