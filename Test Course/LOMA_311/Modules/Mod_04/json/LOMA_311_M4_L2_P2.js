The designations “to my children,” “to my brothers and sisters,” and “to my grandchildren’ are class designations. Class members who survive the insured are entitled to share in the policy proceeds equally. The advantage to the policyowner of making a class designation is that the members of the class who will share in the policy proceeds are not determined until the policyowner dies. People who are born or adopted after the designation is made are automatically included as beneficiaries without the policyowner’s execution of a new beneficiary designation. The disadvantage of a class designation is that, before any proceeds are paid, the insurer must identify and locate all members of the beneficiary class. Locating all of the class members after the insured’s death may be difficult and, thus, could delay payment of the policy proceeds."

An irrevocable beneficiary’s vested interest in the policy proceeds usually continues as long as the policy remains in force or until the beneficiary (1) consents in writing to a change of beneficiary or (2) predeceases the insured. In many divorce cases, one spouse is required either to purchase a life insurance policy and make the other spouse an irrevocable beneficiary or to name the other spouse as the irrevocable beneficiary of an existing insurance policy. An irrevocable beneficiary designation may also be required if the policyowner assigns ownership of the policy to another party; we discuss assignments in more detail in the next chapter."

As a result, if an irrevocable beneficiary has not attained the age of majority, the policyowner cannot obtain the beneficiary’s consent to any policy transaction. Furthermore, a minor’s guardian typically cannot consent on the minor’s behalf. The guardian has a duty to protect the interests of the minor and, thus, usually cannot consent to a transaction that would reduce the minor’s interest in a policy. Therefore, when a policyowner designates a minor as an irrevocable beneficiary, the policyowner is generally unable to interact with the policy in any way that would require the beneficiary’s consent until the beneficiary reaches the age of majority and gives consent."

For example, assume that at the time of their divorce, a man owned a policy on his life and the wife was the revocable beneficiary. The fact of the divorce does not affect the husband’s ownership of the policy, and the wife remains the beneficiary until the husband changes the beneficiary designation. In granting a couple a divorce, however, the court may include an order that one party keep a life insurance policy in force and keep the former spouse as the irrevocable beneficiary. Usually a court includes such an order as part of an alimony or child support arrangement, so that the beneficiary or children will continue to be provided for in the event of the insured’s death."

If a policyowner’s bank account or credit card does not have sufficient funds to make the payment, the insurer may lapse the policy for nonpayment of premium.

The policyowner has the contractual right to select one of the dividend options specified in her policy. Typically, a policyowner selects an option when she completes the application for insurance, but she may change the option at any time during the life of the policy. However, to change to the additional term insurance option, the policyowner usually is required to provide the insurer with evidence of the insured’s insurability. Policies also specify an automatic dividend option that the insurer will apply if the policyowner for some reason does not choose a dividend option."

As with cash surrenders, laws in most states permit insurers to defer granting policy loans—except for loans made for the purposes of paying premiums—for a specified period, usually up to six months.

Similarly, if a policy loan is not repaid when the policyowner surrenders the policy for its cash value, the insurer deducts the amount of the unpaid loan and interest from the cash value paid to the policyowner. In contrast, a commercial loan creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the borrower and the lender.

The length of the new contestable period is the same as the original contestable period provided by the policy. However, the new contestable period applies only to statements made in the reinstatement application. Misrepresentations in the original application are contestable only if the original contestable period has not expired.
