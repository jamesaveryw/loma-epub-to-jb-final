We might be sending a contract in the mail, for instance, two weeks after it's been applied for, or maybe even longer in some cases.

So, if you ever hear anybody talk about, \"Well, we have a multichannel service environment,\" what they're really saying is, \"We do more than just one way to communicate.\"</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">Omnichannel, however, you'll hear that term a lot, and a lot of times it's said synonymously with multichannel. But omnichannel is this idea that no matter how you're communicating with your clients, that any certain type of communication, there's a contextual tie-in with any other communication.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">So if I'm a customer working with an omnichannel organization, and I start a customer journey on the internet, I go out to their website and maybe I'm looking up a type of transaction I want to do. And then I decide I want to talk to somebody about it a little bit and I start chatting. That person or that AI that's chatting with me knows what I'm doing on their website and what page I am on and has a pretty good idea of my intent. And then, furthermore, if I decide, You know, this chat isn't so great. I really need to talk to a human right now. This is getting a little bit too complex. When I jump over to the telephone channel in an omnichannel universe using multiple channels for this transaction, or this customer journey, I should experience complete knowledge as the service rep taking that call of what's been going on in advance of this phone call. So that I can say, \"Mrs. Jones, are you calling about that withdrawal you were looking at on the internet just now or chatting with us on just now?\"</p>"

Sometimes they struggle because they don't feel like they get to be on that front line with the customers, but really what they're doing is they're so important in that foundational base and really what those front-line people need. And when we have those people that understand the customer relationship on the back end, that really helps to build a lot more success for those front-line employees.</p>"

What choices have they made? What are those implications to not only the organization or the employees, but ultimately to the policyholder?

How that's changed more recently is fraudsters get smarter. As fraudsters get more sophisticated, we are challenged to make sure we are prepared to respond to that. That comes back to if it doesn't look right, doesn't feel right, say something. But moreso, we can't leave that to that fraud policy that's online that gets looked at once a year. We can't leave that to online training that's only mandated maybe once, or twice, or three times a year. We have to look for ways of how we can build that into our processes every day—our daily work of reminding employees of what's right, what's not right along the way, rather than just leaving one day or one time a year that we focus on fraud.</p>"

We put that really at the core of everything we do from strategy, to product development, to sales. It's really fundamental to everything. When somebody has maybe a bad experience or an experience that makes them upset, we have our associates who are trained in two key competencies. Those are active listening and empathy. With active listening, that's really just the process of those associates taking a moment to listen for really good understanding of what's causing them to feel frustrated, upset, just having a bad experience. Then couple that with empathy skills, and that's really putting ourselves in the shoes of the customer or the financial adviser. Again, just to really have a good understanding of everything that's taking place, that's causing them to have maybe a bad experience.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left; font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold\">Joan Smasal<br>Assistant Director of Learning Strategy and Execution<br>Northwestern Mutual</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">So I would say the number one skill that we need to be better at as people in the service profession is listening. We need to ask the deeper questions and listen for the question the client doesn't know enough to ask at that point.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">You can miss what that client is actually asking for, which then causes for a repeat phone call. So we have now negated everything we were working for. So we are now looking more at the experience, as in let's sit and talk to that client and listen to that client as long as we need to in order to understand what it is they're looking for and resolve that client's needs in that very first interaction.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left; font-size: 110%; font-weight: bold\">Brian Clifford<br>Second Vice President<br>Security Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">When I listen to what a customer's needs or wants are, I literally repeat, when I'm done listening to what they're saying, that I understood, \"This is what you were asking.\" When I first started practicing this, myself, I realized that probably 30 percent of the time, I was perceiving what was requested in the way I wanted to perceive it and not the way the customer did. Therefore, it's very important that you repeat to the customer that your understanding is, \"This is the service that you'd like provided to you,\" and provide that service accordingly.</p>"

I think that is an excellent question. I would say it is both something people come to the table with based on the way they were raised, their background, and their work experiences.

Also, training is critical to understanding empathy, because what the training piece does is it introduces you to new concepts, and also gets very specific in </p><ul style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\"><li>How does that look?</li><li>How do I behave differently?</li><li>What is the value that I bring every day by choosing to help create this culture and drive my organization forward.</li></ul>"

When somebody is already in a reactive mode and is already impatient, you don't want to meet them at that level. You always want to start much lower, at a much lower level off the bat so that you can meet them with kindness, with patience, and help them work through. A lot of times we find when even a very reactive customer or somebody who's already charged up, if you will, by the time they get on the phone, if the person that answers the phone has a patient, has a kind tone to their voice, that a lot of times will bring them down just a couple of levels right off the bat. Then they can work through whatever issues that they may have.</p>"

We also do try to, where possible, look at industry benchmarks and what our competitors are doing. We'll even look at some benchmarks from the real stretch targets from players outside of our industry such as the Amazons, etc., where they're excelling in customer experience. </p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">So, it starts there, but we have to set some benchmarks which are first and foremost realistic and can be measured. There's no point setting a goal if at the end of the year we're not going to be able to measure because you can't see the improvement or the change, and it's just not good for morale if you can't see any progress you're making.</p>"

But we kind of compared average handling time with customer satisfaction, and they don't always go hand in hand. Even though, from a business perspective, you try to reduce average handling time, less time on the phones improves the costs, actually customers may want that little bit of extra time on the phone to get to the bottom of any issues.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">So it's not always the case. It's about really fact finding and going to the root cause. The CSR has to make a decision on is now the right time to keep the customer on the phone for an extra 10 or 15 minutes and try and resolve this. Some customers may be wanting to stay on the phone. They just want to resolve this first time.</p>"

The text then goes into a database, which is \"mineable.\" So you've heard \"big data\"? You've heard a lot about big data, I'm sure. And that's what speech analytics does, it takes your voice data, turns it into big data text, which is a lot more user-friendly for the computers. So you go in, you create categories.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">Let's say you wanted to listen to calls about taxes. So all of those conversations have been turned into text. You create a category by having the text search for the word \"taxes,\" or \"IRS,\" or \"tax return,\" or \"1099,\" you name it—whatever those key phrases are for your line of business that has something to do with taxes. Then analytics will go through every single phone call in its database, which, for us, is 100 percent of calls for a 12-month period of time. That's a lot of phone calls. It's a lot of words, and it's a lot of data.</p><p style=\"width: 100%; text-align:left;\">And it pulls back the most relevant items, and then you get in there, roll up your sleeves, and do a little human listening, and come up with some conclusions, make some hypotheses, make some improvement suggestions, go out there and make the world better.</p>"
