A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">systematic risk</span>—also known as a <em>nondiversifiable risk</em> or <em>market risk</em>—has a broad, similar effect on all elements in an economic system and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Within a given market, every investment is exposed to a systematic risk. For instance, the prospect of a shift in a central bank’s monetary policy that leads to a change in market interest rates is a systematic risk to all investments in that market. For a portfolio with investments in multiple countries, an important systematic risk is <em>geopolitical risk</em>, which is the risk that political instability or conflicts between countries adversely affect economic conditions. For example, a war between two neighboring countries is likely to have a negative economic effect on businesses operating in either country."

A specific risk is associated with an individual company or industry, but not an entire market. For instance, the prospect of a new government regulation that affects only the airline industry is a specific risk for airline companies."

Typically, two characteristics associated with greater interest-rate sensitivity are lower coupon rates and longer terms to maturity. In general, bonds with lower coupon rates take longer to generate cash flows that cover the original cost of purchase than bonds with higher coupon rates. Likewise, cash flows from bonds with longer terms to maturity generally take more time to cover the investor’s original cost than those of bonds with shorter terms to maturity. Bonds with greater interest-rate sensitivity also experience greater market value volatility."

The company’s interest-bearing investments, however, continue to earn the older, lower rates that prevailed when the company purchased them. If the company immediately pays the new higher rate on its products, the company’s interest margin will narrow. If the company does not pay the new higher rate on its products, the company will likely lose customers and business from financial professionals. To minimize the risk of margin compression, insurance companies typically try to issue products that limit customer withdrawal rights during a policy’s early years. Watch Video 4.2 for a demonstration of how an insurer’s interest margin can narrow as market interest rates increase."
