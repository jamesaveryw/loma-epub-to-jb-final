Most companies allocate indirect salary costs by using time analysis, which is beyond the scope of this textbook. Indirect costs other than salaries include rent, utilities, institutional advertising, association dues, medical fees, and information processing services. A company may or may not decide to distribute these costs among cost centers. Usually the size of the company and the level of financial information needed for decision-making are key factors in determining the allocation of these indirect costs. Similarly, the methods of allocating such indirect costs also vary by company, and even within a company depending on the cost type. Typically, a company allocates indirect costs other than salaries in the same proportion as the direct salary costs for that department or function. Thus, when a number of cost centers are involved in one function, the company allocates indirect costs based on each cost center’s share of the total payroll. Figure 13.6 shows an example of this method of cost allocation."
