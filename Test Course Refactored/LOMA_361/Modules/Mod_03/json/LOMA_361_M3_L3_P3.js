For example, an insurer might first trace the activity of printing marketing brochures for agents to the payments made to an outside printer, and then trace the printer payments (costs) to the lines of business that used the marketing brochures."

Example: The underwriting decision is one activity driver for underwriting.<br /><br />Step 3: Assign costs to each activity. Example: Managers track underwriting time and relevant costs for salaries, equipment, and supplies.<br /><br />Step 4: Determine the unit cost of each activity for comparative purposes. Example: The insurer divides total underwriting costs by the number of applications underwritten. Therefore, $43,750 underwriting costs ÷ 350 applications underwritten = $125 unit cost.<br /><br />Step 5: Identify all areas for which the costs of that activity apply. Example: The outputs for underwriting unit costs are individual life insurance policies for which a decision was made.<br /><br />Step 6: Assign each activity cost to the smallest meaningful organizational unit for which it has meaning. Example: The insurer assigns the activity costs for underwriting individual life insurance to the individual life line of business."

The system must be able to identify each function within the company—marketing, claims processing, information processing, underwriting, etc.—as well as each line of business. These functions, lines of business, and so on, may not coincide with the company’s departmental units. For example, at one company the policy issue function might be the responsibility of a single subdivision of one department, whereas at another company the function might span two or more departments. When developing a functional cost accounting system, system designers must be careful to include all activities and costs—and only those activities and costs—that are relevant to the specific function under study. The entire functional cost accounting system should be flexible enough to change as the company grows or diversifies. The system should also be able to provide for exceptions and peculiarities within any function or line of business."
