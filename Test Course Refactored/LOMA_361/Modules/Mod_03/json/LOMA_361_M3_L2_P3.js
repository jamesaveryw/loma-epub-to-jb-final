Consider if Forge were to view the online service upgrades in terms of “total service investment,” and calculate the investment costs as $1,200,000 (last year’s $500,000 sunk cost + the $700,000 cost of the online service system upgrade) versus $650,000 (last year’s $500,000 sunk cost + the $150,000 cost of call center promotion).

Semi-variable costs include the costs for electricity, heat, repairs, telephone, and building maintenance. For example, the cost of electricity involves a basic monthly service charge to have electricity available for use. This charge is the fixed component, and it remains the same each month regardless of how much electricity the insurer uses, even if the insurer uses no electricity at all. The variable component of the insurer’s electricity cost includes the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity the company uses. If the insurer shuts off all its office lights every night, it uses fewer kilowatt-hours of electricity—and therefore incurs a lower variable electricity cost—than if it keeps its lights on all night. Figure 13.3 illustrates graphically the semi-variable costs of electricity."
