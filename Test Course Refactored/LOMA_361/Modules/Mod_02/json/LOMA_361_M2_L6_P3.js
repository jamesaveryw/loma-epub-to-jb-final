Operating expenses, such as acquisition, development, maintenance, and overhead expenses, arise in the normal course of conducting business. Although insurers can readily identify the amount of contractual benefit expenses and agent compensation expenses incurred by product type or line of business, it is more difficult to determine what portion of the insurer’s operating expenses applies to a particular product. One important aspect of accounting for expenses concerns the allocation of operating expenses. In accounting, to <em>allocate</em> an amount is to distribute the amount <em>proportionally</em> among several accounts. The U.S. Annual Statement requires insurers to allocate operating expenses by lines of business."

Keep in mind that, for agent commissions and other expenses that can easily be directly attributed to a specified product, expense allocation is unnecessary.
