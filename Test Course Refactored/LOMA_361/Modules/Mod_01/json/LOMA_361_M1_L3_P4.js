For example, according to the cost concept, a company reports the <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">historical cost</span>, which is the original purchase price of an asset, on its balance sheet. An asset’s historical cost is derived from its book value on the date of purchase.

(We discuss depreciation later in this chapter.) The reasoning behind the cost concept is that an asset’s historical cost provides a reliable measure of the asset’s value, because the historical cost is a verifiable figure that will not change. However, an asset’s historical cost may lack relevance because the asset may have significantly increased or decreased in value over time. Although the cost concept is useful in recording the values of certain assets, such as operations that depreciate equipment, companies often use other valuation methods to report the value of assets. We discuss these other methods in Chapter 5."

Because transactions can take place over multiple accounting periods, a company’s management must ask the question: When should we record each revenue and each expense? To help companies answer this question, the accounting profession has developed two principles: (1) the realization principle for revenue recognition and (2) the matching principle for expense recognition."

Under <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">immediate recognition</span>, a company recognizes all costs as expenses during the current accounting period. Under statutory accounting principles, life insurers generally must use immediate recognition to recognize <em>all</em> incurred expenses—not just expenses for which the insurer cannot match revenues—in the current accounting period, rather than spread these expenses over the accounting periods in which premium income was earned."
