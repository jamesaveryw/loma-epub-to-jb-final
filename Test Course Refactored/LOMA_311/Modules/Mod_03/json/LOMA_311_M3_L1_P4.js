The main purpose of insurance is to protect against the risk of financial loss—whereas the main purpose of an investment is to provide financial gains. To encourage people to protect their families from the financial loss that can occur when a wage earner dies, federal tax laws generally do not treat death benefits as taxable income. However, when an insurance product has features that resemble an investment, federal income tax laws may treat the benefit as taxable income. When designing products, insurers consider how the product will be treated for federal income tax purposes. If the product must contain certain features in order to provide favorable income tax treatment, then an insurer might include those features to make the product more attractive to consumers who are seeking tax benefits."
