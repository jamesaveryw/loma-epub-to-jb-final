However, an insurable interest usually is not required for a group contract because the group policyholder’s interest in the contract does not induce wagering contracts as does a policyowner’s interest in an individual life insurance contract.

The goal of group life insurance underwriting is to cover a group of insureds who present similar underwriting risks and whose mortality experience is reasonably predictable. Rather than focus on the risk characteristics of individuals, group underwriters focus on the characteristics of the group as a whole."

We discuss some of these conditions later in the chapter. When an insured is required to provide evidence of insurability, that evidence generally is documented in a questionnaire included in or attached to the group member’s enrollment form (described below). If an insured makes material misrepresentations of fact in providing evidence of insurability, the insurer has the right to contest the insured’s coverage during the contestable period shown in the contract and certificate of insurance. Note that a material misrepresentation by an insured does not affect the validity of the group contract; it affects only the validity of the coverage on the particular insured."
