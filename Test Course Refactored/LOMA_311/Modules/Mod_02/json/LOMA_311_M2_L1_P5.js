For example, if any requirement for the formation of a contract was not met, the defendant has a legal defense to the lawsuit. In cases where the defendant lacked the necessary legal capacity to enter into a contract, the contract is void or voidable by the defendant and the plaintiff’s action for breach of contract will fail. Other defenses to the formation of a contract include duress, undue influence, misrepresentation, and fraud."

For example, a party may—because of weakness, trust, or dependence—unreasonably rely on the advice of another. The potential for undue influence exists in relationships between lawyer and client, doctor and patient, guardian and ward, and parent and child. The stronger party exerts undue influence by using his position to persuade the weaker party to act for the benefit of the stronger party rather than the weaker party."

Such a contract is voidable whether the person making the misrepresentation did so knowingly or in the belief that their untrue statement of fact was true. Material misrepresentation is an important defense for insurers because they must be able to rely on representations of fact provided by applicants for insurance. This reliance on accurate representations of fact has given rise to the concept of utmost good faith, as described in the insight below. We discuss material misrepresentation in more detail in Chapter 13. "

The buyer has the responsibility of reasonably examining the item to be purchased before the purchase is completed. In recent years, consumer protection laws have reduced the number of contracts governed by the caveat emptor principle. Today, caveat emptor applies largely to goods and property that are sold “as is,” or that otherwise come with no guarantee or warranty."
