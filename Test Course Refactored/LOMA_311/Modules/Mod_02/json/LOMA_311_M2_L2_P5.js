Generally, an employer has no vicarious liability for the torts of an independent contractor. In contrast, when an employee commits a tort in the course of employment, the employer also is liable for the tort. In other words, the employer is vicariously liable for the harm that resulted from the tort even though the employer may not have been directly at fault. Thus, from a legal standpoint, the actions of many employees in a life insurance company can have an impact on the company. As we saw in Chapter 1, an effective compliance and ethics program along with a strong corporate culture provides important safeguards against such liability. The insight below describes vicarious liability in more detail."
