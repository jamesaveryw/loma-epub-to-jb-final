Precedent perfected its security interest on January 20. On April 1, Fullbore borrowed money from Cygnet Bank and gave Cygnet a security interest in the same machinery. Cygnet Bank perfected its security interest on April 10. When Fullbore defaulted on both loans, it owed $5,000 to Precedent Bank and $2,500 to Cygnet Bank. Precedent Bank foreclosed on the machinery, which it sold for $6,000, and incurred costs of $200 in the foreclosure proceedings. Because Precedent Bank perfected its security interest first, it has priority over Cygnet Bank. Thus, Precedent Bank is entitled to recoup the $5,000 debt owed by Fullbore and the $200 foreclosure costs. The remaining $800 received from the machinery’s sale is payable to Cygnet Bank."
