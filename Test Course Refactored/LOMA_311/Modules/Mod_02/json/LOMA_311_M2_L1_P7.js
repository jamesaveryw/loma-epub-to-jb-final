A written agreement provides evidence that the contract exists and evidence as to the terms of the contract. If a lawsuit concerns an oral contract, the parties have the often difficult task of proving that a contract was formed and proving the terms of the contract. If there is no written evidence of the contract, the court must base its decision solely on the conflicting testimony of the parties to the contract."
