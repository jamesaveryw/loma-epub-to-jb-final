A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">contract</span> is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties; the agreement consists of a promise or a set of promises. A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">breach of contract</span> is the failure of a party to perform a contractual obligation. For example, if an insurer did not pay a claim that an insurance contract required the company to pay, the insurer may be guilty of breach of contract. A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">tort</span>is a private wrong—other than a breach of contract—for which the law provides a remedy to the wronged party. We will discuss torts in greater detail later in this chapter. "
