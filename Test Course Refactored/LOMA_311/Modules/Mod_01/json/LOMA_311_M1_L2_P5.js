As we noted, the parties are free to settle their dispute at any time, and they sometimes try to settle the matter by means of alternative dispute resolution methods. By <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods</span> we mean any nonjudicial method of resolving civil disputes. For example, parties usually first try to settle their disputes themselves by means of formal or informal negotiations. We commonly refer to disputes resolved in this way as <em>settled out of court</em>. Mediation and arbitration are two other common forms of dispute resolution in the United States."
