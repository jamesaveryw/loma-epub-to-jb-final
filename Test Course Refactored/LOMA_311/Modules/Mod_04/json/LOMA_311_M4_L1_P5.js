For example, assume that a financial professional repeatedly accepts renewal premium payments from one of his clients and remits the payments to the insurer. If the insurer establishes a pattern of accepting the payments from the financial professional, then the insurer has in effect agreed to the financial professional’s actions. Therefore, the insurer probably has conferred apparent authority on the financial professional to accept future renewal premium payments from this client. Payment of a renewal premium to a financial professional who has apparent authority to accept it is payment to the insurer even if the financial professional does not promptly remit the payment to the insurer. The scope of an agent’s authority is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the situation."
