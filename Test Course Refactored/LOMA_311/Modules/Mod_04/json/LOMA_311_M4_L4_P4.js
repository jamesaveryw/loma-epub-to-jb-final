The phrase ensures that the policy never becomes incontestable if the person whose life is insured dies during the contestable period. Thus, the insurer will <em>always</em> have the opportunity to investigate for material misrepresentation if the death of the insured occurred within the policy’s contestable period."

Life insurance policies typically specify that the contestable period starts on the date of issue. Similarly, most states require a two-year contestable period that starts on the date of issue. Sometimes, however, the policy does not specify the date the contestable period starts. When this situation occurs and the date of issue and the effective date are not the same, an ambiguity arises as to which date should be used to determine the start of the contestable period. Under rules of contract construction, ambiguities in a contract are construed against the party that drafted the contract. In this case, a court would interpret the terms of the contract in a manner that is more favorable to the policyowner.
