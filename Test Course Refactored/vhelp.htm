<h1>How To Use SCORM Visualizer</h1>
<p><strong>SCORM Visualizer&copy;</strong> supports 
  SCORM 1.2. You can use  Visualizer to</p>
<ul>
  <li> View the communication between your SCO and the SCORM runtime API</li>
  <li> List the SCORM data items supported by your LMS</li>
  <li> Inspect the SCORM communication between your LMS and off-the-shelf content</li>
</ul>
<p>You can run Visualizer two modes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong><a href="#standalone">Standalone</a> mode: </strong> Visualizer acts like an LMS. It provides 
    the SCORM Runtime API to your SCO </li>
  <li> <strong><a href="#passthrough">Pass through</a> mode: </strong> Visualizer sits between your LMS 
    and your SCO.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="standalone"></a>Standalone Mode</h2>
<p>In standalone mode, Visualizer acts like an LMS. It provides 
the SCORM Runtime API to your SCO.</p>
<h3>Installing Visualizer For Use In Standalone Mode </h3>
<p>To use Visualizer in standalone mode, it is usually best to install the Visualizer files (visualizer.htm, vcode.js, vblank.htm, vhelp.htm) at least one folder level higher than your SCOs. This keeps the Visualizer files separate from your SCOs and course which will make it easier to create your SCORM package.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> You develop your courses in a folder named <strong>development</strong>. The <strong>development</strong> folder contains folders named <strong>course1</strong> and <strong>course2</strong>. The <strong>course1</strong> folder contains several SCOs in individual folders. The first SCO is in a folder named <strong>sco1</strong>. It is best to install the Visualizer files in the <strong>development</strong> folder. This allows you to launch the SCOs in both courses.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Launching a SCO </h3>
<p>When you are ready to launch a SCO, supply the relative path to the file that launches  your SCO and then click the
  <input name="Launch" type="button" id="Launch" value="Launch">
  button. Your SCO will be launched in a popup window.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have installed Visualizer in a folder named <strong>development</strong>. The <strong>development</strong> folder contains a folder named <strong>course1</strong> which contains a your course. The <strong>course1</strong> folder contains several SCOs in individual folders. The first SCO is in a folder named <strong>sco1</strong>. The launch file for the first SCO is a file named <strong>index.htm</strong>. To launch this SCO in Visualizer, enter the relative path to the SCO. In this example, the relative path is <strong>course1\sco1\index.htm</strong>. Click the 
    <input name="Launch" type="button" id="Launch" value="Launch">
button to launch the SCO. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>After you have launched the SCO, you will see how the SCO is using the SCORM Runtime API in the bottom of the Visualizer 
    window. The bottom window shows a log of the SCORM API calls. When your course calls LMSSetValue, you will see the  SCORM data item  updated 
    in the SCORM data window. You can modify the SCORM  data by clicking on the name of the data item.</p>
<p>There is a separator bar between the log window and the SCORM data window. You can move the separator bar to change the size of the windows. </p>
<p>Now that your SCO has been launched, interact with your SCO and examine the changes to the log and the SCORM data window. When you are done interacting with the SCO, close its window. </p>
<h3>Relaunching a SCO </h3>
<p>One of the most powerful features of  Visualizer is the ability to relaunch 
  a SCO in a new session. In the new session, your SCO will be able to access cmi.core.lesson_status, 
  cmi.suspend_data and other data items set in previous sessions. To relaunch your SCO, click on the 
  <input name="Relaunch" type="button" id="Relaunch" value="Relaunch"> 
  button.</p>
<h3>Reset the SCORM Data</h3>
<p>If you have launched your SCO one or more times, it has probably set one or more of the SCORM data items. After a few launches, you might want to reset the SCORM data to its original values so you can try an initial launch again. To reset the SCORM data, click on the 
  <input name="Reset" type="button" id="Reset" value="Reset"> 
  button.</p>
<h3>Saving and Restore SCORM Data</h3>
<p>If you are using Internet Explorer on Windows, Visualizer lets you save all of the SCORM data to your hard drive. Later you can restore this data. This lets you conduct SCO tests over several days.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To save the SCORM data, click on the 
    <input name="Save" type="button" id="Save" value="Save">
    button. Visualizer will ask you for a file name to store the data. You should store the data in a file named <strong>savedata.htm</strong>. </li>
  <li>To restore the SCORM data, click on the
    <input name="Restore" type="button" id="Restore" value="Restore">
    button. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="passthrough"></a>Pass Through Mode</h2>
<p>In pass through mode, Visualizer sits between your LMS 
    and your SCO. To use Visualizer in this mode, you will launch it as a SCO from your LMS. As soon as  Visualizer is launched, it pulls 
  all of the SCORM data from the LMS. This gives you the chance to fully understand 
  the data available to your SCO. After Visualizer is launched by the LMS, you 
  can specify the URL of your SCO.</p>
<p>After you have launched the SCO, you will see how the SCO is using the SCORM Runtime API in the bottom of the Visualizer window. The bottom window shows a log of the SCORM API calls (all of the API calls are passed to the LMS). When your course calls LMSSetValue, you will see the SCORM data item updated in the SCORM data window. There is a separator bar between the log window and the data window. You can move the separator bar to change the size of the windows. </p>
<p>Now that your SCO has been launched, interact with your SCO and examine the changes to the log and the SCORM data window. When you are done interacting with the SCO, close its window.</p>
<h3>Loading Visualizer Into Your LMS For Pass Through Mode</h3>
<p>When you use Visualizer in pass through mode, it must appear as a course with a single SCO to your LMS. To use Visualizer in pass through mode, you must know how to load a SCORM 1.2 content aggragation (a course) into your LMS. Theese are different methods that may work with your LMS:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SCORM 1.2 Package Interchange Format - The Visualizer software comes in a zip file. This zip file is a SCORM 1.2 Package Interchange Format.</li>
  <li>SCORM 1.2 Manifest - The Visualizer Software comes with a manifest file (<strong>imsmanifest.xml</strong>).</li>
  <li>SCO Launch File - The launch file for Visualizer is <strong>visualizer.htm</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Modifying Visualizer</h1>
<p>To modify the fonts used in Visualizer, edit the &lt;style&gt; tag in <strong>vblank.htm</strong>.</p>
<p>The SCO is launched in a browser window with these parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Width: 800 pixels</li>
  <li>Height: 600 pixels</li>
  <li>No address control </li>
  <li>No menu bar</li>
  <li>Resizable</li>
  <li>No Status bar</li>
  <li>No Toolbar</li>
  <li>Scrollbars enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>You can modify these parameters by changing the value of the variable<strong> sLaunchParams</strong> in <strong>visualizer.htm</strong>.</p>
