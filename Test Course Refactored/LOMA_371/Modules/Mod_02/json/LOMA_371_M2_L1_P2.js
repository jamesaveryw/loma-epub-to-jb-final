The fast follower product is similar to a first mover’s product, but with improvements designed to appeal to a larger portion of potential customers, or refinements based on emerging experience. The fast follower strategy does not require the same degree of market research and innovation that the first mover strategy requires. However, a company needs to be quick and insightful to be able to produce an improved product before the company’s competitors do. In the insurance industry, the fast follower strategy often focuses on taking technological innovations and adapting them to product design."

Insurers develop complex products for a variety of reasons—for example, to meet the needs of consumers in target markets, to differentiate their products from those offered by industry competitors, and even to compete against products offered by competitors outside the insurance industry. Part of the risk of complex products is determining the proper pricing for the additional benefits. Another part of the risk is that customers find it easier to understand simpler products, even when a more complex product might suit a customer’s needs better. Figure 5.3 illustrates examples of product complexity."

For example, consumer-facing technology such as health-tracking wearable devices can provide an insurer with detailed data points on an insured person’s heart rate, activity levels, and so on. This data can inform the underwriting process and allows the insurer to create insurance products that offer lower premiums if the insured maintains a more active lifestyle. The varying premium amounts thus add to a product’s complexity."

As mentioned previously, new products have no experience data for insurers to draw on. For these products, companies have increasingly turned to stochastic modeling processes. As you recall from Chapter 4, stochastic modeling enables users to randomly model unknown future events to gain a better understanding of how a product might perform. Technological advances in computing power allow more companies to make greater use of stochastic modeling. In turn, stochastic modeling allows insurers to create complex products such as variable annuities with living benefit riders, which involve anticipating inflation and other variables 20-40 years into the future. However, stochastic modeling still poses challenges to insurers—even in companies where stochastic modeling is established, the processes require continual learning, and the models are subject to ongoing refinements."

New or changed laws and regulations can have a profound effect on an insurer’s products. In most instances, a newly passed law or regulation does not take effect immediately—instead, it sets a date in the future by which insurers are expected to be compliant. This practice gives insurers time to make any required changes to their products or processes, but speed is still a key issue for affected insurers. To demonstrate compliance, an insurer makes a policy filing for each of its products. A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">policy filing</span> is the act of submitting a policy contract form and any other legally required forms and documents to the appropriate state insurance department for approval. Insurers in many U.S. states can also file through the <em>Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact (Insurance Compact)</em>, which acts as a central point for electronic filing for those states, thus reducing the number of policy filings."

The more innovative the product, the more time it typically takes for regulators to be satisfied that the new product is fully compliant. As the regulators become familiar with the new product, similar products spend less time in the filing process. Therefore, regulatory issues are likely to have a greater impact on a company pursuing a first mover strategy than they do on a company pursuing a fast follower strategy."

Blocksmith found the new product was more difficult to price than its other products, given the additional variables of calculating how many customers would be likely to take advantage of this feature, and what effect their increased exercise might have on mortality. However, Blocksmith decided the possibility of earning lower premiums would be highly attractive to potential customers, especially customers who would appreciate an additional incentive to exercise more."
