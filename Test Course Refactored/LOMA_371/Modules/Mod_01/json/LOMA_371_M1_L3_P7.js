Recall that <em>operational risk</em> is the risk of financial losses resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, controls, systems, and people. The challenge of measuring and managing operational risk can be overwhelming. Ideally, companies take a comprehensive approach to operational risk measurement and management that includes a variety of tools. These tools range from key risk indicators, risk maps, loss-incident databases, and control self-assessments to the methods of scenario testing and simulation modeling, which we discuss in the next chapter."

Limits and thresholds may be set to help show whether an indicator is red, amber, or green. The amber zone is given more priority than green, and red is given even greater priority.
