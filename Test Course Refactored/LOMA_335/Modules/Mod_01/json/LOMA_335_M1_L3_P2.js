For example, a supervisor has legitimate power over direct reporting employees, and a divisional manager has legitimate power over the supervisor. Thus, the divisional manager has more legitimate power than does the supervisor because of her position. Reward power typically flows from legitimate power in that those with legitimate power can usually give pay raises, promotions, and special recognition. Like reward power, coercive power is associated with legitimate power in that a manager has the authority to institute disciplinary actions when an employee’s performance is not adequate. Referent power can result from a person’s own qualities that inspire loyalty and respect, or from that person’s connections to another. For example, having a close relationship with the company’s president might give a person referent power. Expert power and referent power tend to be most effective within a collaborative work environment. Referent power, however, takes time to develop and so is not as useful when a company has high employee turnover. The use of coercive power tends to result in decreased employee satisfaction with the organization."
