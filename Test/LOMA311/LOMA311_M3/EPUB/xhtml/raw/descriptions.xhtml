                    <p>Step two: In most states, examiner completes NAIC standard complaint form

                        Database System (CDS) which provides regulators with aggregated complaint
                        data on insurers</p>
                    <p>Step four: Examiner sends copy of complaint to insurer and asks insurer
                        to respond in writing</p>
                    <p>Step five: If insurer responds by stating complaint is not valid, it must
                        provide examiner with supporting documentation</p>
                    <p>Step six: If complaint is valid, insurer responds to examiner and explains

                        contract.</p>
                    <p>The contract has a 30-day probationary period and a 31-day enrollment
                        period.</p>
                    <p>Her coverage is contributory.</p>

                        enrollment period. Because coverage is contributory, Rosa is not automatically
                        enrolled in the plan. If Rosa enrolls during the enrollment period, coverage

                        To enroll, she must provide satisfactory evidence of insurability to the
                        insurer.</p>
                    <p>If the group contract includes an open enrollment period, then Rosa may
                        enroll during the next open enrollment period without submitting evidence
                        of insurability.</p>
                    <p>Rosa also may enroll during a special enrollment period at the time of
                        a specified life event, such as marriage or the birth of a child.</p>
