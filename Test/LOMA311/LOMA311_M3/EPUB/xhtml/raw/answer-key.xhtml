                            <p class="explanations">All the statements are correct. The states and the federal government
                                each play a role in regulating insurance. One of the powers the Constitution
                                gives to the federal government is the power to regulate interstate commerce,
                                which is commerce across state lines. The states, on the other hand, have
                                the power to regulate intrastate commerce, which is commerce within a state.
                                Because insurers typically conduct business across state lines, the federal
                                government has authority to regulate insurance activities. According to
                                the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the regulation of insurance by the states is
                                in the public interest. Congress retains the right to enact insurance legislation
                                if it decides that state regulation is inadequate or not in the public
                                interest.</p>

                                to meet their debts and to pay policy benefits when they come due. Solvency

                                Market conduct laws are enacted to make sure that insurers conduct businesses
                                fairly and ethically. Market conduct laws set mandated benefits and regulate
                                most of the nonfinancial operations of insurers, such as management, marketing,
                                sales, underwriting, policyowner service, complaint handling, and claims.</p>

                                (2) they may use the model as the basis for developing legislation or regulation,

                                to maintain accreditation with the NAIC, the department must have adequate

                                The assets that an insurer may report as statutory assets are known as
                                admitted assets. All other assets are known as nonadmitted assets. An insurer
                                must report nonadmitted assets, such as furniture and fixtures, separately
                                and may not use them to support its required reserves. The admitted assets
                                held by U.S. life and health insurers primarily consist of corporate stocks
                                and bonds, government securities, mortgages, and real estate.</p>

                                to customers are met to the extent possible. Impaired insurers generally
                                are first placed into rehabilitation, which is one possible outcome of

                                    the insurer takes on the financial risks. To ensure they have the funds
                                    on hand to pay the contractually guaranteed benefits, insurers invest their
                                    general account assets in relatively secure investments. The assets in
                                    a separate account may be divided among various investment funds or subaccounts.
                                    Variable products do not guarantee the exact amount of benefits payable,
                                    so the policyowner, not the insurer, takes on the financial risk of the
                                    investments.</p>

                    when an insurer cannot locate the beneficiary of policy proceeds, it handles
                    the proceeds according to the state unclaimed property laws. Some states
                    require that insurers periodically review the Social Security Administration’s
                    Death Master File (DMF), which is a database of information about people
                    whose deaths were reported to the Social Security Administration.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">The RBD is based on when the plan participant reached age 70½. Participants
                                who attained age 70½ prior to December 30, 2019 have an RBD of April 1
                                of the year following the year they reached age 70½. Participants who attained
                                age 70½ after December 30, 2019 have an RBD of April 1 of the year following
                                the year they reach age 72. Depending on the terms of the plan, a participant
                                who is still working may be allowed to postpone distributions past her
                                RBD. In this case, she does not have to start taking distributions until
                                April 1 of the year after she retires.</p>
