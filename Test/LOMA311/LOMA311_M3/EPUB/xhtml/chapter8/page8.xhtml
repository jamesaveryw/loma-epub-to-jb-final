            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-197">In addition to privacy laws, governments have enacted other types of laws
                that apply to electronic commerce. These laws seek to facilitate transactions
                while protecting the rights, interests, and security of customers and businesses.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-198">To be legally binding, some contracts traditionally require one or both
                    parties to sign a specified paper document. Also, governments around the
                    world have enacted laws that enable parties to effectively contract electronically,
                    using electronic signatures and document records. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-electronicsignature"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-56" role="doc-glossref">electronic signature</span>,
                    also called an <em>e-signature</em>, is a sound, symbol, or other data attached
                    to an electronically transmitted document that was executed or adopted
                    by a person with the intent to sign the document. Essentially, an electronic
                    signature is whatever the parties to a transaction agree that it is. If
                    the parties intend to be bound by the “signature,” then they can agree
                    on the action that will create the signature.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-199">In the United States, the federal <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-electronicsignaturesinglobalandnationalcommerceact"

                    and store documents, and send and receive notices and disclosures. E-SIGN
                    applies to commercial, consumer, and business transactions that affect
                    interstate or foreign commerce and to transactions that are regulated by
                    both the federal and state governments. E-SIGN has the following legal
                    effects when all of the parties to a transaction agree to use an electronic

                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-58" role="doc-glossref">Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)</span>.
                    The UETA is a model law adopted by the <em>National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL)</em> to
                    provide for the effectiveness of electronic signatures.<span class="ens"

                    provisions of the state laws vary greatly. If a provision of a state law
                    based on the UETA is inconsistent with E-SIGN, then E-SIGN preempts that
                    state law provision. To the extent a state law is not inconsistent with
                    E-SIGN, then the state law is effective and is not preempted by E-SIGN.
                    As a result, businesses still need to consider state laws in their approach
                    to electronic signatures.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-204">Under E-SIGN and the UETA, a consumer cannot be required to use electronic
                    records, signatures, or contracts. Instead, the consumer must affirmatively
                    consent to the use of electronic notices and records. Also, the consumer
                    must receive a clear and conspicuous statement of (1) her right to receive
                    paper records, (2) the consequences of later withdrawing consent to receive
                    electronic records, and (3) the hardware and software requirements for
                    access to and retention of electronic records.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-205">Under the provisions of E-SIGN and the UETA, certain legal documents and
                    transactions <em>cannot</em> be completed with electronic signatures. For

                    signature is valid. However, these laws do not directly address the reliability

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-213"><em>Cybersecurity</em> includes the methods used to (1) prevent theft,
                        corruption, and unauthorized erasure of electronic data and (2) protect
                        networks, computers, and programs from being compromised or shut down without
                        authorization. A cyberattack can be catastrophic to an insurer. For instance,
                        an insurer could experience business interruption, theft of customer and
                        proprietary information, and significant expenses to repair damaged hardware,
                        software, and data. Furthermore, a cyberattack could subject an insurer
                        to lawsuits and reputation damage.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-225">As we saw in Chapter 1, the technologies that help regulators and insurers
                                manage regulation and compliance are called <em>regtech</em>. Like insurers,
                                regulators rely on technology to reduce operating costs and improve productivity,
                                accuracy, and the effectiveness of key activities. For example, some regulators
                                now use data analytics to detect insurers and individuals who may be engaged
                                in practices that violate laws. Also, some regulators use artificial intelligence
                                to analyze regulatory filings. In addition, regulators monitor the use
                                of technology by insurers. When regulators address the impact of technology
                                on the insurance market, they often look to protect consumers by focusing
                                on data security and market conduct practices. They examine activities
                                such as data collection, pricing, underwriting, claims, and customer notification.

                                        the insurance industry is facing. One goal of this plan is to provide state
                                        insurance regulators with the data, training, and tools they need to foster
                                        stable financial markets and reliable and affordable insurance products.
                                        Another goal is to maintain consumer protections in a rapidly changing
                                        insurance marketplace, while providing consumers with the information they
                                        need to make informed decisions.</p>

                                        consumers and state regulators. For instance, the NAIC plans to:</p>

                                    have entered the insurance marketplace. The NAIC is positioning itself
                                    to help the states regulate these firms and provide protections for consumers,
                                    while also promoting industry growth.</p>

                                    NAIC, state regulators, and insurance laws and regulations adapt to the
                                    rapid pace of change that technology brings to the insurance marketplace.
