            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-77">To sell life insurance in the United States, an insurance agent must be
                licensed by each state in which he conducts business. Licensing requirements
                seek to ensure that insurance agents are (1) of good character and (2)
                knowledgeable about the products they sell.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-78">A candidate for a license must pass a written test in each line of insurance
                he plans to sell. Most states consider annuities to be a type of life insurance.
                Thus, a license to sell life insurance usually includes annuities. In addition
                to obtaining a state insurance license, an insurance agent who plans to
                sell variable products must be a registered representative associated with
                a FINRA member.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-79">The GLB Act, as we saw in Chapter 7, requires states to adopt uniform
                or reciprocal insurance agent licensing laws. The intent of this requirement
                is to simplify and streamline licensing from state to state. To meet the
                GLB uniform requirements, many states have established:</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-84">As an alternative to these uniform requirements, the GLB Act allows the

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-89">As we saw in Chapter 3, most states have enacted general unfair trade
                practices laws. In addition, as part of their insurance codes, most states
                have an <em>Unfair Trade Practices Act</em> that defines certain practices,
                including sales practices, as unfair. These insurance laws prohibit practices
                in the business of insurance if the practices are committed (1) flagrantly
                in conscious disregard of the act or (2) so frequently as to indicate a
                general business practice. The laws generally apply to all people and legal
                entities that engage in the business of insurance, including insurers and
                insurance agents. Prohibited activities include</p>

                <h4 id="loma311-ch8-h4-2">Replacements</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-95">Insurance agents sometimes advise clients to surrender a policy and replace
                    it with another. The replacement may give a policyowner access to features
                    not present in the current policy or may provide features that meet a policyownerâ€™s
                    changing needs. In some cases, however, a replacement may benefit the agent
                    more than it benefits the client because the agentâ€™s first-year commissions
                    are higher than recurring commissions. Most states permit replacements,
                    but impose requirements that agents and insurers must meet when a transaction
                    involves the replacement of an inforce individual life insurance or annuity
                    policy.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-96">In many states, the Unfair Trade Practices Act governs replacements by
                    prohibiting misrepresentations. Also, most states have specific regulations
                    that apply to replacements. Typically, these regulations are based on the
                    NAIC <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-lifeinsuranceandannuitiesreplacementmodelregulation"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-34" role="doc-glossref">Life Insurance and Annuities Replacement Model Regulation (Model Replacement Regulation)</span>.
                    The goal of the Model Replacement Regulation is to make sure that insurers
                    and insurance agents provide consumers with fair and accurate information
                    about policies so that consumers can make informed decisions.</p>

                id="loma311-ch8-p-97"><strong>Insurance Agents</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-98">According to the Model Replacement Regulation, an insurance agent must
                    submit a replacement statement along with every application for a policy
                    intended to replace an in-force individual life insurance policy or annuity
                    contract. The applicant and the agent must sign this statement. The statement
                    indicates whether the policy applied for will replace an in-force policy.
                    If the applicant has an in-force policy that is subject to the Model Replacement
                    Regulation, then the agent has a number of other duties. One such duty
                    is to give the applicant a written notice regarding replacement. This notice
                    includes general information about the potential effect of a replacement.
                    It advises the applicant to consider all the relevant facts before making
                    a replacement. Both the applicant and the agent must sign this notice.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-100">The Model Replacement Regulation also imposes requirements on insurers.
                        For instance, when an insurer uses direct response solicitations in which
                        no agent is involved, the insurer must ask an applicant whether he intends
                        to replace an existing policy. If so, the insurer must provide the applicant
                        with a notice regarding replacement and must make an effort to secure a
                        copy of the notice signed by the applicant. Insurance companies that use
                        insurance agents to sell insurance are required to oversee the activities
                        of their agents and to ensure that agents submit required statements and
                        notices.</p>

                            for elderly customers.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-108">In addition to general suitability requirements, many states have laws
                            that address elder financial abuse. Some of these laws are based on a model
                            law developed by the <em>North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)</em>.
                            The NASAA model law requires financial professionals, including insurance
                            agents who sell variable products, to report suspected senior financial
                            exploitation to state authorities and to a third party previously identified
                            by the senior. The model law also allows financial professionals to delay
                            fund disbursements from seniorsâ€™ accounts. The law grants immunity from
                            civil liability in such situations.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-109">Some states have enacted laws to provide added protections to seniors
                            for annuity transactions. These laws may include one or more of the following:</p>

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-113">In addition to state laws, U.S. federal law seeks to protect seniors from
                                financial exploitation by encouraging financial services professionals
                                to report suspected fraud. Federal law gives immunity from liability to
                                those who, in good faith and with reasonable care, notify a regulatory
                                or law-enforcement agency about possible financial exploitation of a senior.
                                This immunity is provided to financial professionals (and the firms that
                                employ them) who have received training to identify suspected exploitation
                                of seniors.</p>
