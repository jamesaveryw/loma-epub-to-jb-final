                The Model Advertisements Regulation requires insurers to disclose to the
                public all relevant information in their advertisements of life insurance
                and annuities. The regulation applies to advertisements distributed or
                used by an insurance company or an insurance agent. The Model Advertisements
                Regulation also specifies the types of advertisements that are subject
                to the regulation, including:</p>

                        are designed to be used to induce the public to purchase, increase, modify,

            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-73">Illustrations, as noted in the list above, are sales aids that are subject
                to the Model Advertisements Regulation. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-illustration"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-29" role="doc-glossref">illustration</span> is
                a presentation or depiction that shows consumers how the nonguaranteed
                values of a policy might vary over time. Most states have laws or regulations
                based on the NAIC <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-lifeinsuranceillustrationsmodelregulation"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-30" role="doc-glossref">Life Insurance Illustrations Model Regulation</span>,
                which sets rules that insurers and insurance agents must follow when using
                illustrations in life insurance sales. The goals of this model regulation
                are to (1) ensure that illustrations do not mislead consumers and (2) make
                illustrations easier for consumers to understand.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-74">Insurance departments have broad powers to regulate any type of communication,
                whether or not it is listed in the state’s advertising regulations. For
                example, most states do not specifically address social media in advertising
                requirements. Yet insurance departments expect communications via social
                media to comply with advertising standards.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-75">As a general rule, advertisements must be truthful and must not mislead
                or have the capacity to mislead. State insurance departments look at the
                overall impression an advertisement may reasonably create for a typical
                person in the target market. Such an impression is created not only by
                language but by graphics, format, and emphasis.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-76">The Model Advertisements Regulation requires insurers to maintain a system
                of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements.
                Some states require that insurers set up an advertisement tracking database.
                Also, the model regulation and some states require each insurer to include
                with its Annual Statement a certification that the advertisements used
                by or on behalf of the insurer comply with all applicable requirements.
                This certification must be signed by an authorized officer of the insurer.</p>
