            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-260">Insurance laws in many countries include market conduct requirements.
                As we have seen, these laws are designed to make sure that insurers conduct
                business fairly and in a way that protects the public interest. Regulators
                also periodically conduct market conduct examinations. A <em>market conduct examination</em> is
                a formal investigation of an insurer’s nonfinancial operations.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch8-p-261">In the past, U.S. state insurance departments routinely conducted comprehensive
                examinations of licensed insurers. A <em>comprehensive examination</em> is
                a full-scope market conduct examination by insurance department examiners
                to ensure that all nonfinancial aspects of an insurer’s operations comply
                with state insurance laws and regulations. Comprehensive examinations can
                be time-consuming and expensive for both the insurer and the insurance
                department.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-262">Today, state insurance departments work through the NAIC to take a more

                id="loma311-ch8-span-76" role="doc-glossref">Market analysis</span> is a
                process that state insurance departments use to collect and analyze information
                to help them understand the marketplace and identify and assess problems.
                Such analysis enables insurance departments to discover patterns or practices
                of insurers that deviate significantly from the norm or that pose a potential
                risk to consumers. Market analysis helps insurance departments narrow the
                scope of regulatory actions. Thus, the departments can focus resources
                on the problems most in need of regulatory attention.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-281">According to the Market Conduct Surveillance Model Law, states will conduct
                    comprehensive examinations only in unusual circumstances. Thus, target
                    examinations are the norm. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-targetexamination"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-77" role="doc-glossref">target examination</span> is
                    a limited-scope market conduct examination to ensure that the insurer’s
                    operations comply with state insurance laws and regulations. A target examination
                    may focus on (1) a specific line of business or (2) a specific business
                    practice, such as an insurer’s replacement activities or advertising materials.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-282">Examiners usually come to the insurer’s offices for the examination. But
                    if the number of relevant records and files is limited, examiners may conduct
                    the target examination from the state insurance department’s offices. A
                    state insurance department examiner functions as the examiner-in-charge
                    and oversees a team of examiners. Typically, the insurer names an employee
                    to provide support to the examiners, as needed.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-283">Insurers that operate in more than one state are subject to market conduct
                        oversight by each of those states. Market conduct examinations and applicable
                        market conduct laws and regulations are not as uniform as those for solvency
                        examinations. Thus, multistate market conduct examinations are not coordinated
                        to the same extent as multistate solvency examinations.</p>

                        with a method of sharing information on actions taken during the investigation

                                issues an order to the insurer listing recommendations from the report.
                                In some cases, the department specifies a date by which the insurer must

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-303">If the examination report indicates a violation of state insurance law,
                                the insurance department may sanction the insurer. Typically, penalties
                                result when violations are due to the insurer’s general business practices
                                or when the insurer knowingly violated laws. Most sanctions are fines;
                                in some cases, the department may suspend or revoke the insurer’s certificate
                                of authority.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-304">After completion of the market conduct examination, many insurance departments
                                conduct a follow-up examination, known as a <em>reexamination</em>. The
                                purpose of the reexamination is to determine whether the insurer has complied
                                with the recommendations or directives contained in a previous examination
                                report.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-305">Insurers are encouraged to create their own self-compliance programs and
                        to report any compliance problems. States will often reduce the penalties
                        when an insurer discovers a compliance problem on its own, reports it,
                        and takes corrective action. Thus, companies that have controls and practices
                        in place to detect and prevent illegal activities often receive a lesser
                        fine than do companies that take fewer steps to monitor compliance.</p>
