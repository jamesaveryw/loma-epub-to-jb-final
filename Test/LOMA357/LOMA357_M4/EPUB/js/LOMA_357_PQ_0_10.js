The IOSCO’s Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU) provides assurance that a company’s interests can be protected after it invests across a national boundary. Thus, the MMoU supports cross-border investing by financial services companies.</p><p class=\"explanations\">Statement B is correct. The EU maintains agencies that oversee financial activities, including the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), which supervises insurance and pension activities to protect the interests of insurance policyowners and pension plan members and beneficiaries. Solvency II introduced risk-based capital requirements, which influenced the asset allocation decisions of many insurers in the EU.</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 10G.
