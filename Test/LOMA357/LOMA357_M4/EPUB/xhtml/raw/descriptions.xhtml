                    <p>The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) identifies emerging risks
                        in the financial system and coordinates regulatory responses to any systemic
                        threats. The FSOC also identifies systemically important financial institutions,
                        whose failure could threaten the countryâ€™s financial stability.</p>
                    <p>The Office of Financial Research (OFR) supports the FSOC by collecting
                        financial data, performing research and analysis, and developing risk measurement
                        tools.</p>
                    <p>The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) monitors the insurance industry and
                        helps the FSOC to identify systemically risky insurers.</p>
                    <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) establishes rules to protect
                        consumers from unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices arising from within
                        the financial sector.</p>

                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>The decision tree starts with a question: is the insurer a publicly traded
                        stock company? If the answer is yes, then the company is subject to SEC
                        regulations.</p>
                    <p>If the insurer is not a publicly traded stock company, then the tree branches
                        to another question: does the insurer sell variable products? If the answer
                        is yes, then the company is subject to SEC regulations.</p>
                    <p>If the insurer is not a publicly traded stock company and the insurer
                        does not sell variable products, then the company is not subject to SEC

                        such things as asset allocation strategies and credit quality limits.</p>
