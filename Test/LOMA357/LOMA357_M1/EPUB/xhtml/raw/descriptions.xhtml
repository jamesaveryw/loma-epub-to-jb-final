                        first to collect and make payments. Second is the AA debt tranche and third
                        is the A debt tranche. The equity tranche is the last to collect and make

                    <p>Typically, a structured security is divided into tranches. For example,
                        this structured security has four tranches, arranged according to each
                        tranche’s seniority.</p>

                    <p>The structured security is comprised of pools of debt obligations, such
                        as mortgage loans. When borrowers make payments on their debt obligations,
                        the payments represent investment income that is distributed to the structured
                        security’s investors.</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[A water pitcher labeled “Monthly payments collected from borrowers appears

                        tranche, Equity tranche.]</p>
                    <p>Distributions are based on tranche seniority. The AAA debt tranche is
                        the most senior tranche. It is the first to collect payments from borrowers,
                        and the first to make payments to investors.</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[Water from the pitcher pours into the AAA debt tranche bucket.]</p>
                    <p>The AA debt tranche is the second most senior tranche. It is second to
                        collect payments from borrowers, and second to make payments to investors.</p>
                    <p
                    class="vid-desc">[Water from the pitcher pours into the AA debt tranche bucket.]</p>
                        <p>The A debt tranche is the third tranche. It is third to collect payments
                            from borrowers, and third to make payments to investors.</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[Water from the pitcher pours into the A debt tranche bucket.]</p>
                        <p>The equity tranche has last priority for distributions. The equity tranche
                            is considered the riskiest tranche because it is the most likely to be
                            affected by late payments and defaults.</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[Water from the pitcher pours into the Equity tranche bucket.]</p>
                        <p>However, the equity tranche has the potential to earn the highest rate
                            of return because it receives all remaining cash after the other tranches
                            have received their payments.</p>
