            class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-388">Many new securities issues require the services of an investment bank.
                Investment banks provide two broad types of services to issuers:</p>

                        <p id="loma357-ch3-p-389">An investment bank <em>underwrites</em> an issue by buying the bonds or
                            stocks from the issuer at a specified price, and then selling the securities
                            to the public at a somewhat higher price. In a <em>firm commitment contract</em>,
                            the bank enters into an agreement to buy all of the newly issued securities
                            from the issuer. By doing so, the bank accepts the risk that it may sell
                            the issue at a price below the price that it paid.</p>

                            shares from the issuer. The best efforts basis protects the bank in the
                            event that it cannot sell all of the issue. Any unsold shares or bonds
                            are returned to the issuer.</p>

                        contract or a best efforts contract to complete a new issue. However, some
                        issuers complete new issues without help from an investment bank. For example,
                        the U.S. Treasury Department issues bonds and sells them at regularly scheduled
                        public auctions.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-392">Issuers also use public offerings to issue additional shares of publicly
                        traded securities. Newly issued shares of a security increase the total

                        because regulators assume buyers are capable of evaluating the securities
                        and their corresponding investment risks. For instance, regulators do not
                        require a prospectus for private placements.</p>

                        id="loma357-ch3-p-405">Secondary markets give securities their liquidity because of the large
                            number of participants. When a market has more participants, more opportunities
                            exist for transactions between participants. In addition, more transaction
                            volume in a security means the transaction prices more closely approximate
