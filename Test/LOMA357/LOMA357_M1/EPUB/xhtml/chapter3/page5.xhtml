            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch3-p-175">Cash, bonds, and stocks are universally considered <em>traditional investments</em>.

                any investment that is not considered a traditional investment. However,
                the term is subjective, because some investors consider real estate, REITs,
                and derivatives to be alternative investments, while others consider some
                or all to be traditional investments. (This text does not categorize real
                estate, REITs, structured securities, or derivatives as alternative investments.)</p>

                wine, jewelry, coins, baseball cards, and stamps. However, most institutional

                            funds usually restrict the investor’s ability to get out of the fund, particularly
                            during the period immediately after the investor purchases shares.</p>

                            generally face less regulatory oversight and fewer disclosure requirements
                            than other types of investment vehicles.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-196">Because they have fewer regulatory restrictions, hedge funds have the
                                flexibility to engage in a wide range of investment strategies. Most hedge
                                funds focus on a particular fund style that takes advantage of the specialized
                                expertise of their investment professionals.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-197">Hedge funds started out as a means to hedge the risk from holding stocks,
                                hence the fund type’s name. Over time, hedge funds increased their use
                                of leverage to amplify returns. Now hedge funds can use derivatives and
                                leverage to aggressively pursue investment gains and even speculate in
                                markets.</p>

                                investments. However, their concentrated bets can expose investors to significant
                                losses. Because concentrated portfolios are less diversified—a concept
                                we explain in Chapter 8—one investment loss could have a large effect on
                                a concentrated hedge fund’s overall return.</p>

                                    id="loma357-ch3-span-69" role="doc-glossref">Infrastructure</span> refers
                                    to the basic facilities and systems that provide the services necessary
                                    for societies and economies to function. In other words, infrastructure
                                    comprises the physical structures that support cities, states or provinces,
                                    and countries. Examples of such structures include roads, bridges, tunnels,
                                    sewers, water supply facilities, cables, telephone wires, and electrical
                                    grids.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-207">Traditionally, direct investment in infrastructure is done by governments
                                    and interested businesses. For example, an energy company may build a pipeline
                                    to expand operational capacity. The pipeline benefits the company by enabling
                                    it to generate more revenue. The country where the pipeline is built also
                                    benefits from enhancement of its infrastructure.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-208">Many institutional investors already have indirect investments in infrastructure
                                    through municipal bonds issued by governments and corporate bonds issued
                                    by companies in certain industries. However, institutional investors can
                                    directly invest in infrastructure by providing capital for infrastructure
                                    projects.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-209">As an investment, infrastructure can provide investors with diversification
                                    benefits because the risk and return characteristics are unlike many traditional
                                    asset classes. In addition, the cash flows generated by infrastructure
                                    are attractive to investors such as life insurers. Life insurers want to
                                    hold long-term assets to match cash flows with their long-term liabilities.
                                    Many infrastructure projects are long-term and have the potential to “provide
                                    stable and secure cash flows for life insurance companies, whose liability
                                    structure affords them more flexibility in investing in a relatively illiquid
                                    asset.”<span class="ens" id="loma357-ch3-span-70"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma357-ch3-en1" epub:type="noteref" id="loma357-ch3-span-71" role="doc-noteref">1</span> </span>

                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-210">Like other alternative investments, infrastructure investments are illiquid.
                                    Furthermore, investors may have difficulty (1) finding information for
                                    proper due diligence and (2) determining asset values for infrastructure
                                    assets.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-211">Another aspect for institutional investors to consider is the infrastructure
                                    project cycle. Investors have to commit capital at the beginning to initiate
                                    the project, but builders need to complete development before investors
                                    can start receiving repayment in the form of incoming cash flows.</p>
