	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>A portfolio’s strategic asset allocation (SAA) should incorporate the expected returns and standard deviations of returns of each asset class.</li>
		<li>A portfolio’s strategic asset allocation (SAA) reflects the expert judgment of investment professionals on the most effective asset-class weightings.</li>

		<li>Within an asset class, investment professionals use sub-asset classes to further customize a given portfolio’s risk profile.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">This statement is false; therefore, it is the correct response. An IPS can include limitations on which asset classes are acceptable for a given portfolio. In addition to return requirements, investment professionals must take into account requirements related to risk appetite, risk tolerance, risk limits, and restrictions on investment practices. Investment professionals typically work with an institution to determine the asset classes and sub-asset classes that are approved and appropriate for a given portfolio.</p>

Whenever the return on Clas &amp; bsp;A increases by one percent, the return on Clas &amp; bsp;B decreases by one percent.

		<li>absent</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Two asset classes are correlated when a change in the market value of one asset class corresponds to a change in the market value of another asset class. If the correlation is positive, the values of the asset classes move in the same direction; if the correlation is negative, the values of the asset classes move in the opposite direction.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Perfect positive correlation between a pair of asset classes exists if an exactly equal increase in the values of one asset class corresponds to an exactly equal increase in the values of the other asset class, or an exactly equal decrease in the values of one asset class corresponds to an exactly equal decrease in the values of the other asset class. Perfect negative correlation between a pair of asset classes is an inverse relationship that exists if an exactly equal increase in the values of one asset class corresponds to an exactly equal decrease in the values of the other asset class, or an exactly equal decrease in the values of one asset class corresponds to an exactly equal increase in the values of the other asset class.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Perfect positive correlation or perfect negative correlation can occur in theoretical or virtual portfolios. However, in investment markets, finding a pair of asset classes with perfect positive correlation or perfect negative correlation is extremely unlikely. Investment professionals most likely encounter aspects of modest positive correlation or modest negative correlation.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The correlation coefficient indicates how closely movements in two asset classes track one another. Correlation coefficient values range from –1, which represents perfect negative correlation, to +1, which represents perfect positive correlation. The stronger the positive correlation, the more the investor could potentially lose; pairing asset classes with negative correlations reduces the volatility of the portfolio’s overall returns.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Any two asset classes with a correlation coefficient lower than +1 will provide some diversification benefits to a portfolio. However, investors obtain the greatest diversification benefits by holding a pair of asset classes having some degree of negative correlation. In this situation, Class A has a correlation coefficient of –0.85; Mr.&#160;Irby most likely would achieve the greatest<em> </em>diversification benefits by adding Class A to the Fruitful Portfolio.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. The efficient frontier—the set of all hypothetical portfolios having the greatest expected return, each for a specified level of risk—is an upward-sloping curve that incorporates every efficient portfolio calculated by MVO modeling.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. One way to interpret the efficient frontier is as the visual representation of the risk-return trade-off, in the context of portfolio asset allocations. For each efficient portfolio on the efficient frontier, an investor cannot add assets to the portfolio to obtain a higher expected return without increasing portfolio risk, and cannot reduce portfolio risk without decreasing the expected return. The efficient portfolio’s asset allocations become the template for the investment portfolio’s SAA.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Once investment professionals have selected the asset classes and the SAA for a given portfolio, they select the portfolio’s benchmark, which will be used to evaluate the portfolio’s performance. Investment professionals first identify the market index associated with each asset class used in the portfolio. Then, the asset class benchmarks are weighted according to the portfolio’s SAA, in the proportion that each asset class will be held in a given portfolio. A blended benchmark provides investment professionals with an effective performance standard by which to measure a portfolio that holds several asset classes.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Compared to the other stocks, Stock A has a high 10-year rate of return, but its returns are more volatile, as indicated by its high 10-year standard deviation. Stock A also has the lowest dividend yield and the highest P/E ratio, which may mean that its shares are relatively more expensive. Compared to the other stocks, Stock B has the lowest 10-year rate of return and lowest dividend yield. Stock B also has a high P/E ratio, which may mean that its shares are comparatively more expensive.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Compared to other stocks, Stock D has the highest 10-year rate of return and highest 10-year standard deviation, which may indicate the highest volatility over the same period. Also, Stock D does not pay a dividend and it has a high P/E ratio, which may mean that its shares are comparably more expensive. Therefore, Ms.&#160;Mendez most likely would not select Stock A, Stock B, or Stock D for the portfolio.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Stock B and Stock C have similar values for their P/E ratios.

In addition to absolute return funds, two other common classifications by asset class are equity funds and fixed-income funds. The assets of equity funds, also called stock funds, typically consist of common stocks, but also may include preferred stocks or real estate. Equity funds are often categorized by market cap, industry sector, and/or geographic location.

	<p class="explanations">Growth funds invest in the stocks of companies with the potential for above-average growth, resulting in capital appreciation.

	<p class="explanations">Value funds invest in the stocks of companies that are undervalued in relation to the overall market, and that often pay significant dividends. Value stocks generally are associated with patient investors who will wait for a stock’s market price to rise to the value they believe it deserves. Value funds tend to outperform growth funds during economic recessions.</p>

		<li>An active management strategy, which attempts to earn the average market return earned by fund peers, is characterized by a low portfolio turnover rate.</li>

		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. In the context of fund investing, an active management strategy attempts to outperform the average market return earned by fund peers. A passive management strategy, also known as a buy-and-hold strategy, attempts to earn the average market return earned by fund peers. This strategy is characterized by a low portfolio turnover rate, which is the rate at which the fund buys or sells securities, expressed as a percentage of average total assets. For example, an active manager may trade a bond before maturity if the bond’s current price is above par value, whereas a passive manager usually intends to hold a bond to maturity.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. A fund’s expense ratio expresses the fund’s total annual operating expenses during a given period as a percentage of the fund’s average net assets during the same period. In general, actively managed funds have higher expense ratios than passively managed funds. Actively managed funds charge higher management fees to compensate for the additional resources used in pursuit of market outperformance. Compared to active management, passive management typically involves longer holding periods and less frequent trading, which results in lower transaction costs.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The following statements are about using diversification and hedging to manage a portfolio’s risks. Select the answer choice containing the correct statement.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>Diversification and hedging strategies reduce a portfolio’s systematic risks.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Derivatives are a popular investment vehicle for creating hedges.</li>
		<li>Diversification is a short-term portfolio management strategy.</li>
		<li>Hedging generally is an investment risk elimination strategy.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Traditionally, derivatives were the primary instruments for hedging a portfolio’s investments. Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allow investors to hedge against specific risks such as interest-rate risk or currency risk. Because ETFs generally are less expensive and more liquid than derivatives, they appeal to smaller institutional investors.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Both hedging and diversification are risk reduction strategies that focus on specific risks in a portfolio. Hedging spreads risk through offsetting one asset’s risk by adding a complementary risk in the portfolio. In contrast, diversification spreads risk by investing in assets with different risk characteristics. In addition, hedging is a short-term portfolio management strategy, whereas diversification is a long-term, portfolio management strategy.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Two approaches to investing are top-down investing and bottom-up investing. In (<strong>top-down / bottom-up</strong>) investing, investment professionals first conduct a broad analysis of economic conditions, asset classes, risk exposures, and industries; then they select individual securities. Institutional investors generally use the <strong>(top-down / bottom-up)</strong> investment approach.</p>

		<li>bottom-up / top-down</li>
		<li>bottom-up / bottom-up</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">For both approaches, investment professionals analyze economic and market conditions, industry growth and competition, and the strength and quality of individual companies. The main difference is the order in which the factors are considered.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Top-down investing starts with assessing the big picture in financial markets and eventually, investment professionals select securities that represent the best opportunities in the type of market environment they have identified. Bottom-up investors start by analyzing individual securities and work their way up to analyzing the broad economic and market conditions that affect the securities they have analyzed.</p>

		<li>When a portfolio manager overweights some asset classes in a portfolio, other classes are underweighted.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Tactical changes allow a portfolio manager to change the allocation guidelines in the portfolio’s investment policy statement (IPS).</li>

		<li>Tactical adjustments can involve selected investment vehicles, such as ETFs, which investment professionals use to implement their ideas to enhance portfolio returns.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">This statement is false; therefore, it is the correct response. While tactical changes allow a portfolio manager to temporarily deviate from the SAA, the TAA must still adhere to the allocation guidelines in the portfolio’s IPS. The IPS provides a range of permissible values around the target percentage for each asset class and TAAs must fall within the acceptable range limits for each asset class. If asset class allocations exceed the acceptable limits, the portfolio needs to be rebalanced to return it to the SAA. Many institutional portfolios have policies that require rebalancing at specified intervals.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Investment professionals use market timing strategies to position portfolios to benefit from market trends. TAA includes an element of market timing because portfolio managers make decisions about the optimum times to deviate from the SAA and overweight and underweight asset classes.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Momentum investors and contrarian investors both use market sentiment to identify upward and downward price trends. However, momentum investors intend to ride along with the market for as long as momentum will carry prices higher or lower, depending on the price trend.

	<p class="q-stem-static">Many institutional investors have significant bond holdings. Some institutional bondholders employ a variety of useful bond investment strategies for managing bond investments. Consider the following situations:</p>

	<ul class="examul">
		<li>The Badge Financial Group purchased approximately equal amounts of bonds of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year maturities. When each of these issues matures, Badge will reinvest the principal in 5-year bonds.</li>
		<li>The Captain Life Insurance Company purchased and holds short-term bonds of 1-, 2-, and 3-year maturities and long-term bonds of 20- and 30-year maturities. Captain does not hold any intermediate-term bonds in its bond portfolio.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">With regard to bond investment strategies, this information indicates that a laddering strategy most likely is being used by</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>both Badge and Captain</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Badge only</li>
		<li>Captain only</li>
		<li>neither Badge nor Captain</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Bond investors use a laddering strategy when they purchase multiple bonds, each of an approximately equal monetary amount but with differing maturity dates that occur at regular intervals. By staggering maturities, a bond ladder creates a steady stream of matured principal for spending or reinvestment. For bond investors—such as Badge—a laddering strategy reduces liquidity risk. Laddering pays off in a rising interest-rate environment; principal from each maturing bond is reinvested at a higher coupon rate. In a decreasing interest-rate environment, however, the investor is steadily reinvesting principal into bonds with progressively lower coupon rates, exposing the investor to reinvestment risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In a barbell strategy, the split between short-term and long-term maturities in a portfolio does not need to be exactly equal. Some bond investors may choose a slightly larger short-term group of bonds, while others may prefer a slightly larger long-term group. The main takeaway is that the barbell strategy excludes intermediate-term bonds. For bond investors—such as Captain—short-term bonds generally provide more liquidity, and long-term bonds generally provide higher yields.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">When quoting information about bonds, the yield spread usually is expressed relative to a bond that is common to a particular market—often a government bond. In this situation, Ivory’s yield spread of 160 basis points (bps) over the yield on a comparable U.S. Treasury security, symbolized as T, is expressed in a quoted yield as T + 160. A bp is one-hundredth of a percent, or 0.01%, or 0.000l. Thus, 100 bps equals 1%; 160 bps is equal to 1.6%. The yield on the U.S. Treasury security comparable in duration to the Ivory corporate bond is 3.5%; therefore, the yield on the Ivory bond is calculated as 3.5% + 1.6% = 5.1%.</p>

	<table class="blue indent" style="width:95%">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Buy 25,000 shares of Peridot common stock at or below $47.75 a share</td>

		<li>limit order to sell that specifies an ask size</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The two main types of orders for stock trades are market orders and limit orders. A market order, which is an order to buy or sell a certain number of shares of a stock immediately at the best available price, does not designate price constraints. A trader has no control over the price at which a market order is executed; therefore, institutional investors generally do not use market orders.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A limit order is an order to buy a specified number of shares of a stock at or below a stated price—known as the limit price—or sell a specified number of shares of a stock at or above a stated price. A limit order that is not executed immediately remains in effect until it expires.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The bid price is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a share, and the ask price is the price at which a seller is willing to sell a share. The bid size is the number of shares of stock the trader is seeking to buy, and the ask size is the number of shares of stock the trader is seeking to sell. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price for a proposed trade. In this situation, the limit order will execute immediately if the current price of Peridot common stock is at or below $47.75 per share. Otherwise, the limit order remains valid until it fills, expires, or is cancelled by the investor.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">For this question, if answer choices (1) through (3) are all correct, select answer choice (4). Otherwise, select the one correct answer choice.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">During the selection or analysis of fund options, investment analysts often observe style drift. Style drift can occur as a result of</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>differences between the current and former portfolio managers’ interpretations of stated management objectives in the portfolio ISP</li>
		<li>a portfolio manager’s intentionally extending beyond established style parameters in an effort to improve portfolio returns</li>
		<li>a portfolio’s investments are not properly aligned with its risk and return objectives</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />all of the above</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Style drift is the divergence of a portfolio from its stated investment objective or style. If style drift occurs because portfolio managers are chasing better performance, the portfolio’s actual risk-return profile may not match the intended profile described in the IPS. Style drift could result in a portfolio that no longer meets an investor’s objectives, and is therefore, no longer a suitable investment. Investment professionals monitor portfolios for signs of style drift.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Actively managed funds typically trade more frequently, which provides them with more opportunities to deviate from their stated investment styles. However, passively managed funds can also drift over time. For instance, a passively managed small-cap stock fund may hold stocks that gradually increase in value enough to become classified as mid-cap stocks. If the fund continues to hold such stocks, its portfolio will drift from its small-cap focus.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 9A. Explain why investment professionals monitor portfolios for style drift, allocations that require rebalancing, asset-liability management (ALM) considerations, and compliance to policies and regulations.</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Investment professionals measure and report portfolio performance regularly, using consistent procedures that comply with certain standards and regulations. Two notable types of standards are Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) and asset valuation standards. The following statement(s) can correctly be made about these standards:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>GIPS provide a universal investment reporting methodology that allows a direct, apples-to-apples comparison of investment performance across different investment management companies, portfolios, portfolio managers, and jurisdictions.</li>
		<li>GIPS compliance is not mandatory; however, investors interpret GIPS compliance as an investment team’s commitment to transparency.</li>
		<li>The asset valuation method that an insurance company uses depends on a number of factors, including regulatory requirements, the type of asset, and the purpose for holding the asset.</li>

		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />A, B, and C</li>
		<li>A and B only</li>
		<li>A and C only</li>
		<li>B and C only</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. The CFA Institute’s Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®) are standards for consistent reporting of investment performance and are designed to ensure fair representation and full disclosure of investment performance across a global market.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Notable rules for GIPS compliance include requirements that: asset owners—such as insurers—generally should have at least 10 years of historical performance data that complies with GIPS; all discretionary investment assets should be included in a portfolio’s performance measurement; portfolio performance reports must disclose information relevant to investment performance; and GIPS-compliant performance reports must present benchmark return data with portfolio return data.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is correct. In the context of reporting, asset valuation is the process of calculating the monetary values for assets. Institutional investors use multiple methods of asset valuation. For example, in the United States, SEC-sponsored financial reporting and control standards apply to companies that issue investment vehicles. Life insurance companies that conduct business in the United States also must follow state requirements for the valuation and reporting of securities held in their general accounts.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Excess return is the amount of the portfolio’s total return that exceeds the benchmark return. For proper comparison, the portfolio’s return and benchmark return is measured over the same period. Because total return and benchmark return are often expressed as percentages, excess return can also be expressed as a percentage: Portfolio’s rate of total return – Benchmark rate of total return = Rate of excess return.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Investment professionals do not consider excess return to be the only measure of a portfolio’s investment success. Effective portfolio management considers other factors, such as the level of risk a portfolio accepted to earn its returns, and whether the level of accepted risk exceeded the portfolio’s risk objectives.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Beta is a measure of the volatility of an asset or portfolio in relation to the volatility of a market. The market has a beta of <strong>(0</strong> / <strong>1)</strong>.

	<p class="explanations">A portfolio with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the market and has the potential to earn greater returns than the market when the market’s returns are positive, and has the potential for greater losses when the market’s returns are negative. A portfolio with a beta lower than 1 is less volatile than the market. Such a portfolio has lower potential returns, but also lower potential losses.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Beta is a useful measure for understanding a particular portfolio’s overall exposure to systematic risk, which is also called market risk. A portfolio with a beta value greater than 1 has more exposure to the risks that affect all investments in a given market. Conversely, a portfolio with a beta value less than 1 has less exposure to the same risks.</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Investment professionals can use value at risk (VaR) to isolate and measure the downside risk of investments.</li>
		<li>One advantage of using of VaR is that it considers extreme events and the loss amount that indicates the estimated worst-case scenario—the probability that the actual loss in a portfolio will be greater than the maximum loss estimated in the portfolio.</li>

		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. VaR is an important risk management metric for financial services companies—particularly banks and insurance companies. Companies use VaR to estimate the amount of assets needed to cover their largest possible investment losses for a given period during normal market conditions. VaR has three main components: a time period, a confidence level (as indicated by the assigned probability), and the estimated amount of maximum investment loss.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is incorrect. One criticism of VaR is that it does not take extreme events into account. That is, VaR does not consider negative tail risk, or the risk of a low-probability but high-impact loss that exceeds the maximum amount estimated by VaR. Even with a 99% confidence level of a loss estimate, a 1% chance exists that the loss will be worse than anticipated. The 1% chance represents the negative tail risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The Sharpe ratio measures a portfolio’s returns earned for each unit of risk, when risk is expressed as the standard deviation of portfolio returns. The formula for the Sharpe ratio is: Portfolio’s rate of total return – Risk-free rate of return ÷ Standard deviation of portfolio returns. In this situation, the Sharpe ratio for Kiosk is equal to (10% – 3%) ÷ 2% = 3.5.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A higher positive value for the Sharpe ratio generally indicates a better risk-adjusted return for a portfolio. A negative value for the Sharpe ratio indicates that the portfolio would have performed better by investing in the risk-free asset than by selecting its own investments.</p>

		<li>Jensen’s alpha is a risk-adjusted measure of alpha that factors in the portfolio’s beta to determine whether the portfolio generated positive returns as compensation for the investment risk it assumed.</li>

		<li>A higher, rather than a lower, value for Jensen’s alpha signifies a portfolio manager’s greater skill in generating returns in excess of the returns expected for a given level of portfolio risk.</li>
		<li>In calculating Jensen’s alpha, investment professionals typically use the rate of return of a market index as a proxy for the rate of the market’s return.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Jensen’s alpha is a risk-adjusted measure of alpha that factors in the portfolio’s beta to determine whether the portfolio generated positive returns as compensation for the investment risk it assumed. The Sharpe, Sortino, and information ratios use standard deviation as their measure of risk, which means that they evaluate returns in relation to the portfolio’s combination of systematic and specific risk. Jensen’s alpha uses beta as its measure of risk, which means that it evaluates returns in relation to the portfolio’s systematic risk, or market risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The Jensen’s alpha formula can be expressed as: Portfolio’s actual rate of return – (Risk-free rate of return + [Portfolio’s beta × {Rate of market return – Risk-free rate of return}]). If you know the portfolio’s actual rate of return, use the following formula: Portfolio’s actual rate of return – Portfolio’s expected rate of return = Jensen’s alpha. If the Jensen’s alpha value is positive, then the portfolio’s return has outperformed its expected risk-adjusted return. If the value is negative, then the portfolio has underperformed relative to expectations.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For internal reviews, which focus on a portfolio’s returns as well as its risk exposure, the portfolio’s objectives specify internal standards by which performance is measured. Investment professionals also use risk-adjusted return metrics—such as the Sharpe ratio or Jensen’s alpha—to evaluate portfolio management efforts and to measure how effectively a portfolio used risk to generate its return.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Investment professionals use external reviews to evaluate a portfolio’s investment performance against the performances of its benchmark and other portfolios in its peer group. Generally, investment professionals expect the performance of an actively-managed portfolio to outperform the benchmark’s performance, and a passively managed portfolio to approximately match the benchmark’s performance.</p>

	<p class="explanations">By comparing a portfolio’s return to the results of its peer group, investment professionals can evaluate the portfolio’s relative performance. When compared to its peers, a portfolio’s relative outperformance is another indicator of effective management.</p>
