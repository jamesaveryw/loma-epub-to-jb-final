            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-282">Institutional investors periodically evaluate the performance of their
                portfolios to assess their effectiveness in achieving their investment
                objectives. For example, life insurance companies evaluate their investment
                performance to ensure that they can (1) meet their contractual obligations
                to their customers, (2) maintain their solvency, and (3) increase their
                profitability.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-283">The first step in evaluating a portfolio’s investment performance for
                a specific period is to gather data on the portfolio’s investments. Investment
                professionals usually want to know asset values for the beginning and end
                of the period being measured. In addition, they generally want records
                of portfolio transactions, such as asset sales or investment income received
                during the period.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-284">Investment professionals use several types of systems to collect and record
                investment data. Such systems, as described in Chapter 1, contain information
                about portfolio holdings, transactions, and market values. Investment professionals
                use these systems to generate investment reports for review. At life insurance
                companies, such reports are reviewed by managers and oversight committees.
                For instance, an insurer’s risk committee reviews investment performance
                as part of its ALM oversight.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-285">Evaluating an investment portfolio’s performance entails conducting internal
                reviews, external reviews, and attribution analysis. Investment professionals
                use the insights gained during the evaluation process to make adjustments
                to the portfolio’s ongoing management.</p>

            <h3 id="loma357-ch9-h3-10">Internal Reviews</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-286">Internal reviews of investment performance focus on a portfolio’s returns
                as well as its risk exposure. The portfolio’s objectives specify internal
                standards by which performance is measured. For example, if the portfolio’s
                target for its annual rate of return is 7%, then each year’s rate of return
                will be judged against that standard. Likewise, a portfolio’s actual risk
                measurements are judged against its risk objectives.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-288">The IPS for an insurance company’s investment portfolio includes the following
                        risk objective: at least 90% of the portfolio’s debt securities must have
                        an investment-grade rating (NAIC 1 or NAIC 2) from the NAIC’s Securities
                        Valuation Office. If at least 90% of the portfolio’s debt securities are
                        rated either NAIC 1 or NAIC 2, then the portfolio met this particular risk
                        objective for the evaluation period.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-289">Investment professionals also use metrics to evaluate their portfolio
                management efforts. Risk-adjusted return metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio
                or Jensen’s alpha, measure how effectively a portfolio used risk to generate
                its return. Thus, investment professionals use risk-adjusted return ratios
                as one way to evaluate their effectiveness in managing a particular portfolio.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-290">In addition to internal standards, investment professionals evaluate a
                    portfolio’s investment performance against the performances of its benchmark
                    and other portfolios in its peer group.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-291">Investment professionals typically compare the performance of a portfolio

                </ul>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-294">Remember that portfolios often use a market index to (1) signify the market’s
                    return, and (2) act as a benchmark. Therefore, an actively managed portfolio
                    that uses the S&amp;P 500 Index as a benchmark would be expected to outperform
                    the index’s return. If the portfolio underperforms the index, then it has
                    not met its performance standard for the period.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-295">Investment professionals also compare a portfolio’s performance to the
                    performance of other portfolios with comparable return objectives and risk
                    characteristics. In other words, they compare a particular portfolio’s
                    returns to the returns earned by other portfolios in its peer group.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-296">By comparing a portfolio’s return to the results of its peer group, investment
                    professionals can evaluate the portfolio’s relative performance. When compared
                    to its peers, a portfolio’s relative outperformance is another indicator
                    of effective management. For instance, if a portfolio consistently outperforms
                    its peers, then its portfolio managers are particularly effective at managing
                    investments that are suitable for a particular group of investors.</p>

                        insurers—such as publicly traded insurers—are able to compare their general
                        account investment performance to that of their peers.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-298">During performance evaluation, investment professionals want to know which
                            portfolio management decisions were successful in adding value. Thus, they
                            need a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to the portfolio’s
                            returns. One method of determining how a portfolio manager achieved performance
                            is <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-attributionanalysis" epub:type="glossref"
                            id="loma357-ch9-span-27" role="doc-glossref">attribution analysis</span>,
                            which is an analytical technique that involves assigning components of
                            portfolio returns to specified portfolio management tactics. In this way,
                            attribution analysis identifies the share of portfolio returns associated
                            with each portfolio management tactic.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-299">Investment professionals use attribution analysis to determine whether
                            investment performance for a specific period was mainly due to portfolio
                            management decisions or luck. Thus, attribution analysis helps explain
                            why a portfolio performed the way that it did. The results of attribution
                            analysis can confirm the effectiveness of a portfolio manager’s particular
                            strategy or suggest that a fortunate set of circumstances led to positive
                            performance results.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-300">Attribution analysis compares a portfolio’s performance with that of its
                            benchmark. Quantitative techniques are used to “decompose” the portfolio’s
                            excess return into several <em>attribution factors</em>. Typical attribution

                                    can be strategic or tactical decisions. If the asset weighting is a tactical
                                    decision, then the manager’s skill at market timing is tested. Typically,
                                    a portfolio manager’s asset allocation choices have a significant effect

                                    The effects of security selection may be less significant than an investment
                                    professional anticipates prior to attribution analysis. In fact, studies
                                    have shown that asset allocation decisions generally have a larger effect
                                    on portfolio performance than security selection decisions.</p>

                                    is considered “unexplained” and may arise from estimation errors during
                                    the decomposition process. A high value for residual effects could indicate
                                    that a portfolio’s good performance was due to luck more than skill.</p>

                            need improvement. For instance, they may decide to make changes to a portfolio’s
                            asset holdings or make different tactical asset allocation decisions. If
                            needed, they can also make adjustments to the portfolio’s long-term objectives,

                            factors in Chapter 4. For example, if an economy shifts from one phase
                            of the business cycle to another during a given period, then the performance
                            of multiple investments will be affected during that period. Therefore,
                            investment professionals usually assess the market environment before implementing
