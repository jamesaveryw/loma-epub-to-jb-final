<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma357-ch5-h2-4">Basic Investment Goals</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-32">Why do you invest money? How do you intend to use your investment gains? Investors have different answers based on their particular circumstances. However, most reasons for investing can be categorized according to three basic investment goals:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma357-ch5-ul-7">
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-33">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-33"><span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-capitalprotection" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch5-span-4" role="doc-glossref">Capital protection</span>, also called <em>preservation of capital</em> or <em>preservation of principal</em>, which prioritizes investing in stable assets that are unlikely to incur significant losses</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-34">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-34"><span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-currentincome" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch5-span-5" role="doc-glossref">Current income</span>, which prioritizes investing in assets that generate regular income</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-35">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-35"><span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-capitalgrowth" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch5-span-6" role="doc-glossref">Capital growth</span>, also called <em>capital appreciation</em> or <em>wealth accumulation</em>, which prioritizes investing in assets with the greatest potential for gains</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-36">Capital protection is the most conservative of the basic investment goals. Investors with capital protection goals are concerned with maintaining their current level of capital. Thus, they choose investments that provide their portfolios with stability. Some investments that are suitable for capital protection goals are money market accounts, government bonds, and highly rated corporate bonds.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-37">Many investors with current income goals need steady income to meet their cash needs. While they also value safe assets, they are willing to give up some safety to consider assets with higher yields. Some investments that are suitable for current income goals are fixed-income securities, dividend-paying stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and funds that own bonds or dividend-paying stocks.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-38">Capital growth is the most aggressive of the basic investment goals. Investors with capital growth goals have different levels of aggressiveness. For instance, an investor with moderate aggressiveness may aim for a rate of growth that outpaces inflation, whereas an investor with high aggressiveness may accept large risks in pursuit of large gains. Some investments that are suitable for capital growth goals are stocks—particularly in companies that invest capital into projects with high growth potential—funds that own stocks, real estate properties, and alternative investments.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-39">Typically, investment goals are tied to an investor’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-timehorizon" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch5-span-7" role="doc-glossref">time horizon</span>, which is the length of time that an investor plans to invest in order to reach an investment goal. For example, retail investors with short time horizons—such as workers who are two years away from retirement—do not have enough time to recover if their investments experience significant short-term losses. Therefore, such investors usually have capital protection goals. On the other hand, retail investors with long time horizons—such as workers who are thirty years away from retirement—can sustain short-term volatility in their investments, so they can afford to be more aggressive. Investors with long time horizons usually have capital growth goals.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-40">Investment goals are also tied to an investor’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-risktolerance" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch5-span-8" role="doc-glossref">risk tolerance</span>, which is the degree to which an investor is willing and able to accept risk:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma357-ch5-ul-8">
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-36">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-41">Investors with low risk tolerances are more likely to have capital protection or current income goals because they (1) are uncomfortable with investment volatility or (2) have significant short-term cash needs.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-37">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-42">Investors with high risk tolerances are more likely to have capital growth goals because they (1) are willing to endure high return volatility for the opportunity to earn large returns or (2) usually do not have immediate cash needs.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-43">In general, an investor’s time horizon and risk tolerance are consistent. For instance, an institutional investor with a short time horizon plans to access its capital soon and does not want to take any large risks with its money. However, sometimes investors are not comfortable accepting the level of risk that would usually be appropriate given their time horizons.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma357-ch5-div-8">
<p class="example-header" id="loma357-ch5-p-44">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma357-ch5-div-9">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-45">Valerie Durham is investing her retirement savings. She plans to retire 20 years from now. Based on her time horizon of 20 years, she should consider investing in relatively risky assets with greater growth potential. However, she hates the idea of losing money in any year, even if she has many years to recover a given year’s investment loss. In fact, she would consider leaving her retirement savings in cash to avoid investment losses.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-46"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Because of her strong aversion to risk, Valerie has a very low risk tolerance. Even though she has a long time horizon, her risk tolerance suggests that she would feel more comfortable with a capital protection goal for her investments.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-47">Investors can choose to focus exclusively on one of the basic investment goals, but some pursue a combination of goals. For example, many retirees want to protect capital and generate income; their investment portfolios tend to hold a large percentage of bonds. Other investors may want a portfolio with moderate growth and income generation. These investors could hold a combination of stocks—especially dividend-paying stocks—and bonds. Their portfolios receive the capital appreciation potential of stocks and the coupon payments of bonds.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-48">Ideally, every investment portfolio would protect capital, generate plenty of income, and earn large capital gains. However, investors have to factor in the risk-return trade-off when selecting their goals. For example,</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma357-ch5-ul-9">
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-38">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-49">Capital protection investors who value the safety of low-risk investments have to be willing to accept the possibility of lower investment returns.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma357-ch5-li-39">
	<p id="loma357-ch5-p-50">Capital growth investors who desire the potential for large returns have to be willing to accept more risk.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-51">Therefore, investors usually prioritize their investment goals when constructing their portfolios.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-52">Investment goals can also shift over time. For instance, a person who is investing for retirement may gradually change his goal from capital growth to capital protection as he approaches retirement and has less time to recover from large investment losses. In this case, the composition of the investments in his portfolio would change to match his shifting goals.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-53">In addition to the basic investment goals, investors may have secondary considerations that influence the investments they choose. For example, an investor who needs to maintain a certain amount of liquidity may need to avoid alternative investments, which are generally illiquid. Another investor may choose investments with favorable tax treatment, such as municipal bonds, to minimize the income taxes that she has to pay on her investment earnings.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-54">The following chart summarizes the differences between the three basic investment goals described at the beginning of this chapter.</p>
