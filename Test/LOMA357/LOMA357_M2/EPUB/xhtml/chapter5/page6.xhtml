            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-281">Life insurance companies manage general account and separate account portfolios.
                The varying needs of the different types of insurer portfolios result in
                differences in their respective portfolio objectives. Because the insurer
                bears the investment risk for general account assets but not for separate
                account assets, insurer investment policies focus heavily on general account
                portfolios. Therefore, the insurer portfolio objectives and constraints
                discussed in the remainder of this chapter apply mostly to general account
                portfolios.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-282">A life insurance company’s general account supports many of the company’s
                product liabilities and other general obligations. In turn, the general
                account is affected by the company’s liabilities. A company’s general obligations
                have the following broad characteristics:</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-294">Because a life insurer needs to have cash on hand to cover product obligations
                and capital requirements, capital protection and current income are the
                main objectives for a general account portfolio. However, many contractual
                obligations extend years—or decades—into the future, so an insurer must
                also achieve appropriate rates of capital growth to cover future cash needs.
                By extension, insurers must accept some investment risk to achieve their
                long-term return objectives.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-295">Separate account portfolios are different because the policyowners pick
                investment funds—called <em>subaccounts</em>—based on their personal investment
                goals. As you’ll see in Chapter 7, each subaccount has its own objective.
                Because policyowners pick the subaccounts, the investment function is not
                creating investment strategies for separate account portfolios. Instead,
                the insurer’s main responsibilities are to select a suitable range of fund
                options, perform due diligence on externally managed funds, and invest
                cash in selected funds on behalf of the policyowners.</p>

            <h3 id="loma357-ch5-h3-9">Investment Income</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-296">When an insurance company designs a new product, it makes assumptions
                about the contractual obligations it can expect once the product is sold.
                The insurer also determines the crediting rate that policyowners will receive
                for an interest-bearing product.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-297">A significant portion of an insurer’s general account profitability comes
                from the margin between invested asset returns and the costs to support
                insurer products and capital obligations. As a result, the insurer’s rate
                of return on the general account portfolio must, at a minimum, maintain
                a comfortable margin above the interest rate credited to its product liabilities.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-298">To express the required rate of return on a general account portfolio,
                the insurer specifies a target yield for the portfolio and monitors actual
                performance relative to the target. If portfolio investments earn a yield
                that meets or exceeds the target, the insurer should be able to cover the
                crediting rate.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-299">General account portfolios are also designed to generate sufficient investment
                    income to meet the insurer’s cash needs. Therefore, as you will read in
                    the next chapter, monitoring cash flows—including cash flows generated
                    by investments—is part of an insurer’s asset-liability management (ALM)
                    strategy.</p>

                <h3 id="loma357-ch5-h3-10">Risk-Adjusted Returns</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-300">Riskier asset classes, such as stocks and real estate, have the potential
                    to produce larger returns than safer asset classes, such as bonds. As you
                    read earlier, to have the opportunity to earn larger returns, the insurer
                    must generally accept more risk.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-301">In general, investors do not consider investment returns without also
                    considering risks. For instance, simply looking at the potential returns
                    of stocks versus bonds would lead an investor to choose stocks every time
                    to maximize returns. Obviously, though, not every investor is willing or
                    able to accept the risk required for a chance to earn the potential returns
                    that stocks offer. Therefore, investors need a way to compare investment
                    returns across asset types while factoring in the different levels of risk
                    associated with each type. Investors can make this comparison by calculating
                    an asset’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-riskadjustedreturn" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma357-ch5-span-49" role="doc-glossref">risk-adjusted return</span>,
                    which is a measure that presents an investment return in the context of
                    the amount of risk accepted to earn that return.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-302">Investors use different metrics to express risk-adjusted returns. In Chapter
                    9, we cover specific ratios used by insurers to evaluate risk-adjusted
                    returns. For a given portfolio, an insurer’s return objectives may designate
                    target values for certain risk-adjusted return ratios.</p>
                <div class="clearfix"
                id="loma357-ch5-div-112">&#160;</div>
                <h3 id="loma357-ch5-h3-11">Solvency and Liquidity</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-303">To maintain solvency, an insurance company must take prudent risks and
                    earn sufficient returns to pay contractual obligations and cover company
                    expenses. The investment function’s role is to take enough risk to earn
                    adequate returns, but not so much risk that overwhelming losses occur.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-304">Because life insurers must meet their obligations in cash, they also monitor
                    their liquidity risk through ALM analysis. The investment function selects
                    investments to facilitate liquidity.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-305">In selecting investments that satisfy liquidity and solvency needs, insurers
                        must perform a balancing act between portfolio objectives. Emphasizing
                        capital protection will ensure that enough capital remains to satisfy liquidity
                        needs. However, capital growth is necessary to ensure the company’s solvency.</p>
                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-306">In addition, capital growth is necessary to create and grow an insurer’s

                        role="doc-glossref">surplus</span>, which is the cumulative amount of money that remains in
                            an insurance company over time and is calculated as the insurer’s assets
                            minus its liabilities and its capital. An associated return objective could
                            be to maintain a stable level of surplus.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-307">Insurers are subject to <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-minimumcapitalandsurplusrequirements"

                                which are solvency requirements that set specific minimum dollar amounts
                                of capital and surplus for an insurer as a whole and for each of the company’s
                                product lines. Minimum capital and surplus requirements, also known as <em>statutory minimum capitalization requirements</em>,
                                are established by each jurisdiction’s insurance regulators. An insurer’s
                                general account portfolio objectives should account for the minimum capital
                                and surplus requirements designated by regulators.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch5-p-308">For life insurers, one of the main purposes of investing is to support
                                product obligations. Because of the long-term nature of their liabilities
                                and their need for steady income, insurer general account portfolios typically
                                hold more debt securities than equity securities.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch5-p-309">Portfolio return objectives may designate target values for debt security
                                investments. For example, insurers can assess bond performance by measuring
                                changes in market values, yields, and durations. By monitoring fluctuations
                                in these values, investment professionals can determine whether a portfolio’s
                                bond investments are adequately meeting its objectives.</p>
