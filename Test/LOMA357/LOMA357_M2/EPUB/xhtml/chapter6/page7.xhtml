            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma357-ch6-h2-8">Investment Strategies Related to ALM</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-256">As part of an ALM framework, investment professionals coordinate investments
                to cover outgoing cash flows with incoming cash flows, both in the present
                and the future. However, financial risks—such as interest-rate risk and
                liquidity risk—can jeopardize cash flows.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-257">To hedge against financial risks, investment professionals use derivatives—as
                you will read about in Chapter 8. In addition, they use portfolio management
                strategies such as portfolio immunization, portfolio dedication, and interest-rate
                anticipation. The strategy selected typically depends on the needs of each
                portfolio segment. In some situations, investment professionals apply aspects
                of several strategies to a particular segment.</p>

            <h3 id="loma357-ch6-h3-11">Portfolio Immunization</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-258">Because life insurer investment portfolios contain debt securities, these
                portfolios are exposed to interest-rate risk. Investment professionals
                can protect portfolios from interest-rate risk through a complex investment
                strategy called <em>portfolio immunization</em>. In general, a <span class="gt"
                data-term="ch6-gt-portfolioimmunization" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch6-span-54"
                role="doc-glossref">portfolio immunization</span> strategy consists of any
                measures taken to protect a portfolio against risk due to interest-rate
                changes. Effective immunization positions a portfolio so that the portfolio’s
                value is insensitive—or “immune”—to small changes in interest-rate risk.</p>

                <h4 id="loma357-ch6-h4-13">Duration Matching</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-259">Insurers typically achieve portfolio immunization through the technique
                    of <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-durationmatching" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma357-ch6-span-55" role="doc-glossref">duration matching</span>,
                    which involves matching the duration statistics for fixed-income assets—such
                    as bonds—with the duration statistics for the insurance company liabilities
                    that the assets support.</p>
                <div class="example" id="loma357-ch6-div-109">
                    <p class="example-header" id="loma357-ch6-p-260">EXAMPLE</p>
                    <div class="inner" id="loma357-ch6-div-110">
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-261">&#160;Dexicos Life Insurance Company’s assets portfolio has a duration
                            of six years. Its liabilities portfolio has a duration of seven years.
                            To reduce the mismatch, the company’s investment professionals identify
                            and purchase assets that will increase the assets portfolio’s duration.</p>
                        <p
                        class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-262"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Once the assets portfolio’s duration is seven
                            years, the duration difference will be zero and the general account portfolio’s
                            duration gap will be closed.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-263">Ideally, the assets duration perfectly matches the liabilities duration.
                    However, because a perfect duration match is often difficult to obtain,
                    life insurance companies usually set duration objectives in which the assets
                    duration slightly exceeds the liabilities duration. With this approach,
                    when interest rates are high and start to fall, asset values will rise
                    faster than liability values. For assets and liabilities with long durations,
                    duration matching is particularly important because their market values
                    are more sensitive to market interest-rate changes.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-264">Duration matching can be difficult to implement and maintain. Because
                    the technique involves complicated duration calculations, investment professionals
                    rely on optimization software. In addition, asset and liability durations
                    do not stay constant, so professionals have to make periodic adjustments
                    to keep durations matched. Furthermore, life insurers may have trouble
                    finding assets with durations long enough to match the long durations of
                    certain liabilities, such as contractual obligations for whole life insurance
                    and annuity products.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-265">Another drawback of duration matching is that it does not appropriately
                    address insurer cash flow needs. For example, even when the asset and liability
                    durations are matched, the asset cash inflows could be insufficient to
                    match the liability cash outflows, which would threaten the insurer’s surplus.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-266">Another ALM-related investment strategy for insurers involves the linking
                        of asset and liability cash flows. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-portfoliodedication"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch6-span-56" role="doc-glossref">portfolio dedication</span> strategy
                        consists of deliberately structuring a portfolio of assets so that the
                        anticipated future cash flows from those assets match the future cash needs
                        that the portfolio was assembled to fulfill.</p>

                    <h4 id="loma357-ch6-h4-14">Cash-Flow Matching</h4>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-267">Typically, insurers achieve portfolio dedication through the technique
                        of <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-cashflowmatching" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma357-ch6-span-57" role="doc-glossref">cash-flow matching</span>,
                        which involves identifying the patterns of cash outflows for insurance
                        products and matching those cash outflows with a selection of assets that
                        will produce a similar pattern of cash inflows. In other words, portfolio
                        assets are selected for their ability to generate cash inflows that offset
                        the estimated cash outflows related to an insurer’s liabilities.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-269">Dexicos Life has a cash flow mismatch between its assets and liabilities
                                portfolios. In a given year, Dexicos is projected to have $25 million in
                                inflows from assets but $30 million in outflows for liabilities. Investment
                                professionals select and purchase a collection of bonds with varying face
                                values, coupon rates, and maturity dates to bring projected cash inflows
                                from assets to $30 million.</p>
                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch6-p-270"><strong>Analysis</strong>: By selecting assets with certain characteristics,
                                Dexicos was able to match cash inflows with outflows. Thus, cash-flow matching
                                reduced the risk that the company will not have enough cash to meet its
                                contractual obligations.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-271">In general, cash-flow matching works well for life insurance companies
                            because their liabilities are fairly predictable and relatively long. Life
                            insurers typically buy fixed-income investments to ensure predictable cash
                            inflows. For debt securities, they plan to hold the securities until maturity,
                            so they select securities with terms to maturity that match the anticipated
                            length of time of their liabilities.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-272">Cash-flow matching does have its drawbacks, though. Because many life
                            insurers have large liabilities, they need to find enough assets with matching
                            cash flow characteristics that also fall within their risk limits. These
                            risk limits preclude certain investment options—for example, callable bonds
                            are unattractive because they can be called before their maturity date,
                            reducing the cash inflows available for matching to liability cash outflows.</p>
                        <p
                        class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-273">Another challenge concerns the liability cash outflows that need matching.
                            For instance, less predictable liability cash outflows are harder to match
                            with asset cash inflows. In addition, the size of the liabilities can add
                            complexity to the cash-flow matching exercise. Thus, insurers may require
                            optimization software to maximize a portfolio dedication strategy.</p>
                            <p
                            class="txt" id="loma357-ch6-p-274">Note that cash-flow matching can also be part of a portfolio immunization
                                strategy. Asset cash inflows are matched to liability cash outflows in
                                such a way that the portfolio’s cash flows are protected from interest-rate
                                changes. For life insurers, cash-flow matching may be a more effective
                                technique for immunizing a portfolio than duration matching. The following
                                chart compares the techniques of duration matching and cash-flow matching.</p>
