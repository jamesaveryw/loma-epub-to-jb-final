arrAnswerFeedback[3] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Other investment objectives for a life insurance company’s general account include mitigating certain risk exposures between its assets and liabilities through diversification and hedging, and actively managing its remaining risks after mitigating certain risk exposures. Capital protection and current income are the main objectives for a general account portfolio. Because many contractual obligations extend years—or decades—into the future, a life insurance company also must achieve appropriate rates of capital growth to cover future cash needs. Because of the long-term nature of their liabilities and their need for steady income, life insurance company general account portfolios typically hold more debt than equity securities.</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 5F.
