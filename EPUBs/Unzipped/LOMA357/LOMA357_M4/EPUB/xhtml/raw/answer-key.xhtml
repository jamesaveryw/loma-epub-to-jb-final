                    Therefore, regulatory entities generally use functional regulation, in
                    which a single regulatory body oversees similar financial activities, regardless
                    of which financial institution engages in the activity.</p>

                    securities transactions; penalties for regulatory violations. Insurance
                    laws address the formation, licensing, conduct, operation, transfer of

                            <p class="explanations">The 2007–2008 financial crisis exposed the interconnectedness of financial
                                institutions within the U.S. financial system. Some institutions are large
                                and have many financial relationships with other institutions. Thus, the
                                failure of one deeply enmeshed institution can have a significant ripple
                                effect throughout the industry, endangering the stability of the entire
                                system. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses the systemic risk—the risk that an
                                adverse event significantly impairs the financial system—that such institutions
                                pose.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">To facilitate reform of the U.S. financial system, The Dodd-Frank Act
                                created several federal agencies. The FSOC identifies emerging risks in
                                the financial system, coordinates regulatory responses to any systemic
                                threats, and identifies systemically important financial institutions.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. The Defined Limits Version gives companies specific
                                and narrowly defined limits on specified categories in balancing portfolio
                                risk exposures. Each limit represents an acceptable category of securities
                                or issuers. The limits in the Defined Standards Version are broader than
                                those of the Defined Limits Version, in that insurers have some discretion
                                in selecting investments of varying risk exposures. Unlike the Defined
                                Limits Version, the Defined Standards Version does not specify categories
                                of securities and issuers that are acceptable to regulators.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. The AVR minimizes the effects of both realized
                                and unrealized gains and losses on an insurer’s invested assets when those
                                gains and losses are related to the credit quality of the assets or fluctuations
                                in the prices of equity securities. The IMR helps absorb realized gains
                                and losses on an insurer’s interest-bearing assets when those gains or
                                losses are caused by changes in market interest rates, rather than changes
                                in the credit quality of the assets.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Statement C is incorrect. The AVR and IMR are liabilities, but they are
                                not contractual reserves. They are noncontractual reserves that apply only
                                under statutory financial reporting standards and concern only general

                        <p class="q-stem-static">A soft-dollar arrangement is a situation in which an investment professional
                            directs client trades to a broker-dealer in exchange for receiving soft
                            dollars, which the professional uses to obtain products or services—often
                            research services—from the broker-dealer.</p>
                        <ol class="choices-static">

                        </ol>
                        <p class="explanations">Soft-dollar arrangements cause ethical issues when a client, whose trades
                            are generating commissions for a particular broker-dealer, does not benefit
                            from the services that the investment professional receives by using soft
                            dollars. Because soft dollars are incorporated into trade expenses, clients
                            may not be aware of their true transaction costs.</p>
                        <p class="explanations">Although soft-dollar arrangements are legal in many jurisdictions, the
                            CFA Institute and securities regulators have guidelines regarding the use
                            and disclosure of these arrangements. Some jurisdictions even consider
                            a soft-dollar arrangement a breach of fiduciary duty when the clients involved
                            pay more than the lowest available commission rate.</p>
                        <p class="explanations">The SEC generally considers brokerage services as ineligible for soft-dollar
                            arrangements unless the situation meets certain requirements. An investment
                            professional should be able to demonstrate to the SEC that soft dollars
                            paid for services that ultimately benefitted the clients whose transactions
                            generated those dollars. Otherwise, the SEC could take regulatory action
                            against the investment professional.</p>

                        <p class="explanations">Some notable unethical trading practices are insider trading, trading
                            ahead of research, front running, late trading, and collusion. Front running,
                            a type of insider trading, involves the unethical trade of a security by
                            an investment professional based on advance knowledge of large pending
                            client orders of the security.</p>
                        <p class="explanations">Late trading is a type of illegal preferential treatment given to some
                            investors who are allowed to trade securities—typically open-end mutual
                            funds—after a stock market closes using that day’s closing prices. Late
                            trading enables certain investors to use the day’s closing prices to conduct
                            transactions, which, in turn, are based on information that became available
                            only after the market’s close. Late trading is illegal in the United States
                            because investors use information that was not available when markets were
                            open to gain an unfair advantage over other participants in the market.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. The audit committee of an insurer’s board of directors
                                assists the board in overseeing the internal audit function, independent
                                external auditors, financial reporting practices, internal controls, ethics,
                                and compliance. Other insurers maintain a separate compliance committee.
                                Regardless of an insurer’s committee structure, the insurer’s board develops
                                a corporate audit policy, which describes the insurer’s control framework
                                for conducting audits—including audits of the asset-liability management
                                (ALM) and investment functions.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Statement B is incorrect. One responsibility of asset-liability management
                                (ALM) is to set policies that constrain investment risk taking. Two such
                                policies are the liquidity policy and the duration policy. A liquidity
                                policy typically states the minimum monetary amount of cash and near-cash
                                assets an insurer must hold over a specified period to support its liabilities.
                                A duration policy specifies a numerical target for an insurer’s duration
                                gap value and a numerical range of acceptable values around the target
                                value. Within the investment function, managers may establish additional
                                risk policies for investment portfolios.</p>
