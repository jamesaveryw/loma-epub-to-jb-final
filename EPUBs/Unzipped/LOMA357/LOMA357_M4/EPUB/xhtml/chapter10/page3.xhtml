                        for a customer’s needs. Suitability requirements typically require a financial

                        limit the sharing of customers’ nonpublic personal information, but generally
                        do not limit the sharing of publicly available information, such as telephone

                        and other conduct of securities issuers, (3) arrangements for the establishment
                        and administration of securities exchanges, (4) securities transactions,
                        and (5) penalties for regulatory violations. Securities laws generally
                        apply to life insurers that offer variable life insurance and variable
                        annuities, as well as the separate accounts supporting those products.
                        In addition, securities laws apply to publicly traded companies, which

                        to investment advisory services address individuals and companies that
                        offer recommendations about investing in securities. For regulatory purposes,
                        certain insurance products—such as variable life insurance and variable

                        of insurance companies. In addition, such laws address the issuance, sale,
                        and administration of insurance contracts by specifying the rights and

                        to conduct banking business. Banking laws typically require banks to hold
                        enough capital to meet their obligations and set limits on interest charges.
                        We do not focus on banking laws in this chapter because they usually do

                services industry. For instance, some jurisdictions outside of the United
                States have established a single law to address all aspects of financial
                services—namely securities, insurance, and banking. For jurisdictions that
                take this approach, the law typically addresses the formation, licensing,
                administration, conduct, transfer of ownership, and orderly termination
                of business entities across all aspects of financial services.</p>
