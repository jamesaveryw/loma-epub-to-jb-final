                the responsibility and authority of a company’s board of directors to direct
                the organization to properly fulfill its missions on behalf of the company’s
                legitimate stakeholders in a legal and fiscally responsible manner. A good
                system of corporate governance enables a company to gain and keep the trust

                    statement that an insurer’s board establishes to outline a set of formal
                    rules and guidelines for investing. The corporate investment policy communicates
                    the board’s priorities for the management of corporate assets to the investment

                    policies for investment professionals to follow. For instance, a functional-level

                    details about authorized asset classes and acceptable ranges for holding

                    and extent of the risks the company is willing to take in achieving its
                    strategic objectives. A company’s <em>risk policy</em> explains the principles
                    it will follow for managing risk, outlines the process for managing risk,
                    specifies the authority and responsibility for risk management, and establishes
                    risk reporting and risk controls. For instance, the corporate risk policy
                    establishes clear guidelines for the company’s risk appetite and risk tolerance.
                    In addition, the board clarifies the company’s risk tolerance by including
                    corporate risk limits.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-253">Recall that an insurer’s asset-liability management (ALM) function coordinates
                    risks between the insurer’s assets and its liabilities. As part of its

                            specifies a numerical target for a company’s duration gap value and a numerical

                            6 that the value of a duration gap indicates the size of the mismatch between
                            the asset duration and the liability duration.) Insurer investment portfolios
                            take duration policies into account. For example, if a portfolio segment’s
                            duration gap value is outside the acceptable range, the portfolio manager
                            needs to adjust investments until the segment complies with the duration

                    policies for investment portfolios. For instance, senior managers could
                    designate a limit for the maximum percentage of a portfolio’s assets that
                    can be invested in derivatives. As another example, the portfolio manager
                    in charge of a particular portfolio segment may set risk policies for the

                    a company’s board of directors in overseeing the internal audit function,
                    independent external auditors, financial reporting practices, and internal
                    controls. The internal audit function typically presents results directly
                    to the audit committee. Because the audit staff must maintain a high degree
                    of independence and objectivity, their function is separate from those
                    of the departments they examine.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-262">In some insurance companies, the audit committee also oversees the company’s
                    ethics policy and its compliance with regulations and standards. Other
                    insurers maintain a separate <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-compliancecommittee"

                    which may handle a variety of corporate issues such as corporate privacy
                    policies, data security and usage policies, market conduct, and general
                    compliance. In addition, the board often charges the compliance committee
                    with developing the employee code of conduct.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-263">Regardless of an insurer’s committee structure, its board develops a corporate

                        describes the company’s control framework for conducting audits—including
                        audits of the ALM and investment functions.</p>

                    sufficient oversight of its vendors. Vendor oversight is of increasing
