            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-25">Following ethical standards does not limit a company’s competitiveness.
                In fact, within the financial services industry, a company’s reputation
                for high ethical standards can be a competitive advantage. Building a stellar
                reputation is critical for financial services companies to stand out as
                their products become more commoditized in the minds of consumers.

                role="doc-glossref">Commoditization</span>is the process by which a product reaches a point
                    in its development where it has no features that differentiate it from
                    competitive products other than price. Because many financial services
                    customers don’t recognize the differences between similar products, a company
                    can distinguish itself based on its reputation for quality and fairness.
                    Thus, ethical standards can help companies attract and retain customers.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-26">Regulations and ethical standards both protect the interests of financial
                services customers. In general, regulations are rules that instruct you
                on what you must or must not do, and ethical standards are guidelines that
                advise you on what you should or should not do.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-28">A regulation requires an investment management firm to send portfolio
                            performance reports to its clients at least annually. If the company does
                            not meet the requirement in a given year, it is in violation of the regulation
                            and is subject to regulatory punishment.</p>
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-29">Ethical standards obligate the company to provide information that helps
                            clients understand their performance reports, even though it is not required
                            to do so. For instance, the company discloses that its performance data
                            include transaction costs; this disclosure provides clients with additional
                            context for assessing their investment returns.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-30">At times, regulations and ethical guidelines overlap to affect the behavior
                    of investment professionals. For instance, investment professionals that
                    act as fiduciaries have regulatory and ethical considerations.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma357-ch11-p-31">Clients entrust investment professionals with their money and expect those
                    professionals to apply care and skill in handling their investments. Across
                    the industry, many investment professionals adhere to codes of conduct
                    to maintain customer trust. In addition, ethical standards often include
                    guidelines regarding conflicts of interest, trading practices, and responsibilities
                    to clients.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-32">To promote consistent ethical behaviors among particular groups of professionals,
                    some organizations designate sets of shared ethical standards. For example,
                    a company’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-codeofconduct" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma357-ch11-span-6" role="doc-glossref">code of conduct</span>, also
                    known as a <em>code of business conduct</em> or a <em>code of ethics</em>,
                    formally states its values and its expectations for how its employees should
                    behave in the course of business.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-33">A corporate code of conduct typically illustrates situations that employees
                    might encounter in their work environment and helps employees evaluate
                    the appropriateness of various responses to a given situation. For instance,
                    a company can place a limit on the maximum monetary value of gifts that
                    its employees are allowed to accept from customers and business partners
                    to prevent inappropriate influence.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-35">An employee may accept gifts during the course of employment only if the
                            gift is valued at $50 or less. In addition, an employee may never accept
                            gifts during a bidding process or contract negotiation.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-36">Financial services companies usually have several codes of conduct. For
                    instance, an insurance company may have (1) a general code for all employees
                    and (2) supplemental codes tailored to employees working in specific functions,
                    such as the investment function.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-37">In addition to corporate codes of conduct, investment professionals typically
                    follow professional codes of conduct. Such codes apply to members of the
                    investment profession who agree to support the standards as part of maintaining
                    their professional standing. The insight below presents one of the most
                    prominent codes for investment professionals, which comes from the CFA
                    Institute. The <em>CFA Institute</em> is an international organization that
                    promotes a global set of investment industry standards for ethics and professional
                    conduct. In addition, the CFA Institute offers education programs, such
                    as the <em>Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA®)</em> designation.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-42">Many ethical guidelines for investment professionals describe how to avoid
                    or address conflicts of interest. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-conflictofinterest"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch11-span-7" role="doc-glossref">conflict of interest</span> is
                    a situation in which the interests or actions of one entity are incompatible
                    with the interests or actions of another entity. As the previous chapter
                    described, some investment professionals have a fiduciary duty to act in
                    the best interest of their clients. Therefore, professionals should make
                    every effort to avoid conflicts that tempt them to put their interests
                    ahead of their clients’ interests.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-43">Corporate codes of conduct help investment professionals navigate situations
                    that could affect their judgment. For example, a company policy may require
                    a portfolio manager to disclose any potential conflicts of interest before
                    managing a client’s assets.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-44">In addition, professional code of conduct requirements address conflicts
                    of interest. For example, the CFA Institute instructs investment professionals
                    on the types of conflicts that investment professionals should avoid to
                    maintain their independence and objectivity and recommends controls to
                    reduce the potential for conflicts.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-45">Even the appearance of a potential conflict could compromise a client’s
                    trust. Thus, investment management teams generally have policies to reduce
                    the opportunities for conflicts of interest when managing client portfolios.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-47">An investment management team wants to avoid the appearance of favoritism
                            when it selects brokers to place trades involving client assets. Therefore,
                            the team has a policy of declining all gifts from brokers. In addition,
                            the team maintains transparency by providing clients with an explanation
                            of their process for selecting brokers.</p>
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-48"><strong>Analysis</strong>: The investment team knows that the company’s
                            permissible gift policy could create a conflict of interest. Also, the
                            team is aware that inappropriate acceptance of gifts or benefits can cause
                            the team to lose their objectivity, which can become the basis for client
                            lawsuits or regulatory action. Therefore, they have removed the potential
                            conflict for their team by disallowing gifts from brokers.</p>

                        conflicts of interest may occur because their actions typically have a
                        meaningful effect on the performance of client portfolios. Three types
                        of behaviors that represent conflicts of interest are (1) receiving particular
                        forms of compensation, (2) self-dealing, and (3) engaging in soft-dollar
                        arrangements.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-50">Compensation creates a conflict of interest when an investment professional’s
                        financial incentives are not aligned with his client’s best interest. For
                        example, investment advisors who receive sales commissions for selling
                        investment products may have an incentive to sell products that earn them
                        the highest commissions, even if such products are not appropriate for
                        a particular client. This conflict of interest can affect which products
                        the advisor recommends to the client.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch11-p-52">Antonio LaMotta, an investment advisor, is selecting a mutual fund for
                                the investment portfolio of Lacy Sullivan. Based on research and analysis,
                                he narrows his choices to three similar small-cap equity funds. All three
                                would be suitable for Lacy’s portfolio, but each has a different fee structure,
                                which affects the amount of commission Antonio receives.</p>
                            <p class="txt-ni"
                            id="loma357-ch11-p-53"><strong>Analysis</strong>: The choice between the three mutual funds represents
                                a conflict of interest for Antonio. He has an incentive to choose the fund
                                that generates the biggest commission for him. However, selecting such
                                a fund likely will result in higher fees for Lacy than the other fund choices.
                                Therefore, Antonio needs to recognize the effect of fund fees on Lacy’s
                                investment returns. In addition, he should prioritize fee management over
                                commission generation in his fund selection process.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch11-p-54">Another downside to commission-based compensation is that it can encourage
                        excessive trading. Because commissions represent a cost to the client,
                        excessive trading results in the client paying higher transaction costs
                        than necessary. Part of a fiduciary’s responsibility is managing portfolio
                        costs; thus, excessive trading conflicts with this responsibility.</p>

                        is paid based on services performed for a client, the amount of client
                        assets under management, or both.</p>

                                    (SEC) generally considers brokerage services as ineligible for soft-dollar
                                    arrangements unless the situation meets certain requirements. In such a
                                    situation, an investment professional should be able to demonstrate to
                                    the SEC that soft dollars paid for services that ultimately benefitted
                                    the clients whose transactions generated those dollars. Otherwise, the
                                    SEC could take regulatory action against the investment professional.</p>

                                            In general, an investment professional is supposed to act in the client’s
                                            best interest when executing trades for the client’s portfolio. However,
                                            as mentioned earlier, trading practices can result in numerous ethical
                                            issues. Some notable unethical practices are insider trading, trading ahead
                                            of research, front running, late trading, and collusion. As you will see,

                                                the prohibited act of buying or selling a company’s securities based on
                                                knowledge of material nonpublic information, also called <em>inside information</em> or <em>insider information</em>.
                                                Such information—examples include a company’s financial performance, business
                                                plans, or legal struggles—can significantly affect the market value of
                                                a company’s securities. Therefore, insider trading enables individuals
                                                to unfairly take advantage of and profit from possessing material nonpublic

                                                the United States. For example, the SEC prioritizes the detection and prosecution
                                                of insider trading violations because “insider trading undermines investor

                                                        medicines for cancer prevention and treatment. In 2001, the company’s CEO,
                                                        Samuel Waksal, learned that regulators were going to deny approval of a
                                                        new cancer drug. The drug was expected to be a major source of revenue
                                                        for ImClone, so Waksal knew the negative news would send the company’s
                                                        share price down.</p>

                                                        company. Through her broker, Peter Bacanovic, American businesswoman Martha
                                                        Stewart learned of the pending denial of ImClone’s drug and also sold thousands
                                                        of company shares before the news went public. After the public learned
                                                        that regulators had denied approval of the drug, ImClone shares dropped
                                                        significantly. Thus, through their stock sales, Waksal and Stewart avoided

                                                        to Waksal. As a result of her arrest, Stewart was forced to resign as CEO
