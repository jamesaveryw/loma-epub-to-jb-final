            <p id="loma357-fm-p-26">On behalf of LOMA and its membership, we would like to thank all LOMA
                357 text reviewers and the companies that supported their efforts. Text
                reviewers are busy industry professionals who actively support the educational
                needs of current and future industry employees and generously volunteer
                their time and expertise to review a text’s content. The LOMA 357 text
                development panel made substantive contributions, commented on the developing
                chapters, provided suggestions for additional content, submitted relevant
                research materials, and answered numerous questions posed by LOMA staff.
                LOMA is responsible for the accuracy and clarity of the text, and takes
                responsibility for any errors.</p>
