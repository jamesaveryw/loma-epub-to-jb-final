            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-27">In Chapter 4, we discussed the risks associated with investing and specifically
                about the two types of risks:</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch8-p-30">For investors, systematic risks are unavoidable. To have the opportunity
                to earn investment returns, investors have to accept exposure to certain
                market risks, such as interest-rate changes or inflation. Thus, portfolio
                managers focus their risk management efforts on the types of risks they
                can control—the specific risks within a particular portfolio.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-34">Typically, the primary way to diversify a portfolio is by including multiple
                    asset classes—ideally, asset classes with negative correlations to the
                    other classes in the portfolio. In the last chapter, we explained how asset
                    allocation incorporates diversification among asset classes. We also mentioned
                    that investment professionals can further diversify a portfolio by investing
                    among various sub-asset classes within an asset class.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma357-ch8-p-35">In addition to asset class diversification, investment professionals can
                    diversify portfolios in many other ways. For instance, they can diversify
                    a portfolio’s investments through different</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch8-p-43">Regardless of the manner of diversifying, the goal is the same: to include
                    investments that reduce a portfolio’s exposure to the specific risks related
                    to its existing investments. You’ve heard the adage “Don’t put all your
                    eggs in one basket.” Diversification places portfolio investments in multiple
                    “baskets,” or asset categories, so the portfolio is less dependent on the
                    success of any one basket. In other words, diversification reduces the
                    portfolio’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-assetconcentrationrisk" epub:type="glossref"

                    which is the risk that results when investments are concentrated excessively
                    in any single category.</p>

                            is building an investment portfolio of Canadian real estate properties.
                            The portfolio currently owns one property, a multifamily residential property
                            in Vancouver. Because the real estate portfolio consists of one property,
                            it is entirely dependent on that property’s value. Thus, the portfolio’s
                            risk is concentrated.</p>
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-46"><strong>Analysis</strong>: The portfolio’s real estate property could
                            lose value for a variety of reasons—damage from a fire or flood, increased
                            competition from a new apartment complex built nearby, or a broad downturn
                            in the Vancouver economy. To diversify the portfolio, Laurie could purchase
                            properties with different characteristics—such as residential properties
                            in different sizes, styles, and locations. To further diversify, Laurie
                            could purchase nonresidential properties outside of Vancouver. For example,
                            she could purchase an office building in Montreal or an agricultural property
                            near Winnipeg.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch8-p-47">Diversification is a long-term portfolio management strategy. Over time,
                    proper diversification reduces specific risks so that the majority of the
                    portfolio’s remaining risk is made up of systematic risk. Figure 8.1 illustrates
                    this concept.</p>

                        specific risk gradually declines until most of the portfolio’s risk is
                        systematic risk.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-49">An investor can use a hedge to protect against an adverse outcome that
                    results in a financial loss. An effective hedge balances out an investment
                    loss with an increase in the hedge’s value. By counterbalancing a potential
                    loss, a hedge works to reduce a portfolio’s overall risk.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma357-ch8-p-50">In practice, however, an investment professional may have a difficult
                    time creating a hedge that perfectly offsets a potential loss. Therefore,
                    hedging is generally an investment risk <em>reduction</em> strategy, not
                    a risk <em>elimination</em> strategy.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch8-p-51">In contrast to diversification, hedging is a short-term portfolio management
                    strategy. Investment professionals use hedges to offset adverse price movements
                    in their investments within given periods. After a period of time, a hedge
                    may lose its effectiveness, requiring additional action.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma357-ch8-p-52">Investment professionals use hedges to protect against specific risks—such
                    as currency risk or interest-rate risk. As introduced in Chapter 4, <em>currency risk</em> arises
                    from changes in currency exchange rates, and <em>interest-rate risk</em> arises
                    from changes in market interest rates. Such changes could cause particular
                    investments in a portfolio to lose value. Thus, hedging those investments
                    reduces the potential loss for the investor.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch8-p-53">Derivatives are one of the popular investment vehicles for creating hedges.
                    As we mentioned in Chapter 3, <em>derivatives</em> derive their values from
                    underlying assets. For example, the value of a particular put option on
                    a common stock depends on the fluctuating market price of the stock’s shares.
                    Because of the relationship between a derivative and its underlying asset,
                    an investment professional can position a derivative to gain in value as
                    the underlying asset loses value, thus reducing the effect of the underlying
                    asset’s lost value.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-55">An investor, Helen Flynn, holds shares of a stock and a put option on
                            the same stock. The put option gives Helen the right to sell shares at
                            the strike price until the option expires.</p>
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-56"><strong>Analysis</strong>: If the price of Helen’s stock shares falls
                            below the strike price, then exercising the option will limit her loss.
                            Note that as the stock price falls further below the strike price, the
                            put option becomes more valuable to the option holder—which, in this case,
                            is Helen.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch8-p-57">Derivative values can also be based on other financial market values,
                    such as exchange rates or interest rates. For instance, an interest-rate
                    swap between two parties exchanges the cash flows based on a fixed interest
                    rate with the cash flows based on a variable, or floating, interest rate.
                    Because the assets and liabilities of life insurance companies are sensitive
                    to interest-rate fluctuations, many insurers use interest-rate swaps to
                    hedge interest-rate risk.</p>

                            bonds into bonds with lower coupon rates. Therefore, Dexicos enters into
                            an interest-rate swap agreement with Palance Bank based on a specified
                            principal amount.</p>
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch8-p-60"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Dexicos holds a bond with a floating coupon
                            rate that is pegged to changes in the Treasury bill rate. Dexicos pays
                            Palance the interest payments that Dexicos receives from this bond. Meanwhile,
                            Palance pays Dexicos the interest payments it receives from a long-term
                            bond it holds that has a fixed coupon rate. Because Palance’s long-term
                            bond pays a consistent interest rate, the interest payments are a steady
                            stream of cash that Palance is paying to Dexicos. Dexicos uses the payments
                            to ensure that it can match its asset and liability cash flows, thus hedging
                            against the risk of falling interest rates.</p>

                    portfolio’s investments. However, as ETF offerings grow more diverse, some
                    sophisticated ETFs allow investors to hedge against specific risks, such
                    as interest-rate risk or currency risk. Because ETFs are generally cheaper
                    and more liquid than derivatives, ETFs are appealing options for institutional
                    investors looking to create hedges in their portfolios.</p>
