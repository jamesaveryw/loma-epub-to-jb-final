                    <p>Chapter 7 covers constructing the portfolio. Steps include determining

                        selecting the appropriate asset classes; setting the strategic asset allocation;
                        developing a blended benchmark as a performance standard; and analyzing,
                        selecting, and purchasing initial investments within each asset class.</p>
                    <p>Chapter 8 covers managing the portfolio. Steps include implementing portfolio
                        management strategies, analyzing the market environment for tactical opportunities,
                        executing portfolio transactions, and maintaining operational controls.</p>
                    <p>Chapter 9 covers monitoring and evaluating the portfolio. Steps include
                        monitoring portfolio strategies and compliance, generating performance
                        reports, evaluating portfolio performance, and identifying and implementing

                        cash.</p>
                    <p>In this example, the model projects three outcomes, ranked by probability.

                        outcomes.</p>
                    <p>For annualized rate of return, the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile’s value is

                        the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile’s value is $10,846,921.</p>
                    <p>The chart shows the projected growth in the portfolio’s balance over 30
                        years. There are three lines arcing upward that represent the 10<sup>th</sup>,
                        50<sup>th</sup>, and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile balances. The 10<sup>th</sup> percentile
                        line has the lowest ending balance, the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile line

                        of 6.22% is in the 9<sup>th</sup> percentile of its peer group, while Fund
                        D’s 1-year return of 2.87% is in the 82<sup>nd</sup> percentile.</p>
                    <p>Below the information for the funds is another row for the peer group

                        return, and expense ratio values.</p>
                    <p>Finally, each fund also has a composite rating on a scale of one to five
