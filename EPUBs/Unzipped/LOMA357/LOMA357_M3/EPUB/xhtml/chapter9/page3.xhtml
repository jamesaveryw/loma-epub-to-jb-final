            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-28">Investment professionals monitor institutional investment portfolios to
                ensure that the investments are being managed responsibly. They monitor
                portfolios for investment style drift, allocations that require rebalancing,
                asset-liability management considerations, and compliance to policies and
                regulations.</p>

            <h3 id="loma357-ch9-h3-1">Style Drift</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-29">Many investment portfolios designate an investment style in an investment
                policy statement (IPS) or other type of planning document. For example,
                many mutual funds designate an investment style in the fund’s prospectus.
                Thus, potential and current investors in a given fund typically expect
                the fund’s managers to pursue investments that fit the fund’s stated style.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-30">Over time, a portfolio manager may attempt to improve the portfolio’s
                returns by selecting investments that do not align with the portfolio’s
                designated investment style. The result is <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-styledrift"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch9-span-4" role="doc-glossref">style drift</span>,
                which is the divergence of a portfolio from its stated investment objective
                or style. Although many investors think of style drift as a concern primarily
                for investment funds, any portfolio with an established style can experience
                style drift. Investment professionals analyze portfolio holdings to determine
                the magnitude of a particular portfolio’s style shift.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma357-ch9-p-31">Investors need to know about style drift because it could indicate that
                    a portfolio manager is not following a portfolio’s management guidelines.
                    Eventually, style drift could result in a portfolio that does not meet
                    an investor’s objectives. For instance, current investors in a fund experiencing
                    style drift may find that the fund is no longer suitable as an investment.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-33">As stated in its prospectus, the Dabbledus Equity Value Fund selects value
                            stocks that fit certain criteria for inclusion in the fund’s investment
                            portfolio. Over the past three years, the Dabbledus Equity Value Fund has
                            consistently underperformed a market index that serves as the fund’s benchmark.
                            As a result, the fund’s manager is feeling pressure from disappointed investors
                            to provide strong performance in the near future. Thus, the manager starts
                            to invest in a small number of stocks that fit some, but not all, of the
                            fund’s criteria, in order to benefit from those stocks’ favorable recent
                            performance. In addition, the manager is experimenting with adding growth
                            stocks in an attempt to enhance the portfolio’s overall returns.</p>
                        <p
                        class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-34"><strong>Analysis</strong>: The manager of the Dabbledus Equity Value Fund
                            is gradually investing in stocks that exhibit different characteristics
                            than the portfolio indicated it would hold. Over time, the fund’s actual
                            style is drifting from its intended style. Once investors notice the style
                            drift, some may discontinue investing in the fund because the fund’s actual
                            style is not appropriate for their investment objective.</p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-35">Style drift can occur for a number of reasons. In some cases, a portfolio’s
                        management team may change and the new management’s interpretation of the
                        stated objectives or style differs from that of the former managers. In
                        other cases, such as the above example, portfolio managers intentionally
                        extend beyond established style parameters in an effort to improve portfolio
                        returns.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-36">If style drift occurs because portfolio managers are chasing better performance,
                        the portfolio’s actual risk-return profile may not match the intended profile
                        described in the IPS. This inconsistency can hurt the investor because
                        the portfolio’s investments are not properly aligned with its risk and
                        return objectives.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-37">Style drift is particularly relevant to investment funds, such as mutual
                        funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs). For example, many fund analysts
                        look for how closely a fund’s actual style is aligned with the style stated
                        in its prospectus. Funds with more consistent management styles are evaluated
                        more favorably. External fund rating agencies also evaluate investment
                        styles when determining fund ratings.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-38">Actively managed investment funds are generally more susceptible to style
                        drift than passively managed funds. Actively managed funds typically trade
                        more frequently, which provides them with more opportunities to deviate
                        from their stated investment styles. However, passively managed funds can
                        also drift over time. For instance, a passively managed small-cap stock
                        fund may hold stocks that gradually increase in value enough to become
                        classified as mid-cap stocks. If the fund continues to hold such stocks,
                        its portfolio will drift from its small-cap focus.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-39">For an institutional portfolio, the investment style is derived from the
                        objectives and constraints described in the IPS. An inconsistent style
                        could indicate that the portfolio is not properly focused on achieving
                        its objectives. Therefore, investment professionals monitor portfolios
                        for signs of style drift.</p>

                                portfolio’s bond investment style. Although portfolio managers have some

                        in Chapter 5, when a portfolio’s allocations deviate too far from the strategic
                        asset allocation, investment professionals can rebalance the portfolio
                        to bring its asset weightings back to the intended proportions.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma357-ch9-p-44">Most institutional portfolios include instructions for periodic rebalancing
                        in their IPS. Some portfolios may rebalance on a quarterly basis, while
                        others may only rebalance once per year. In addition, portfolio policies
                        may describe asset allocation criteria, including designated allocation
                        limits. If a portfolio’s allocations exceed its limits, investment professionals
                        may be required to rebalance it immediately, regardless of its next scheduled
                        rebalancing date.</p>

                        an insurer’s actuaries may test more frequently. If necessary, actuaries
                        can work with portfolio managers to adjust investment strategies to support

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch9-p-51">In Chapter 5, we introduced the IPS as a written document that describes
                            a portfolio’s guidelines regarding risk and return objectives, investment
                            constraints, asset allocation, and performance evaluation. The IPS outlines
                            the responsibilities of the portfolio management team. Thus, the team needs
                            to evaluate its activities to ensure that its actions are appropriate as
                            described in the IPS. For example, the portfolio management team monitors
                            the portfolio’s levels of risk against the risk appetite, risk tolerance,
                            and risk limits established in the IPS.</p>

                            in Chapter 5, the <em>risk policy</em> generally outlines the process for
                            managing risk, and the <em>investment policy</em> generally outlines a set
                            of formal rules and broad guidelines for investing. These policies may
                            be more or less restrictive than a particular portfolio’s IPS.</p>

                            the results of cash-flow testing. This committee also reviews internal
                            reports, such as the duration gap report. Therefore, investment professionals
                            monitor investments for their potential impact on ALM efforts and may have

                                    for the subpar performance. Insurers need to replace funds that no longer
                                    meet the objectives of their separate accounts. Prior to removing a fund
                                    from their subaccount offerings, an insurer typically places the fund on
                                    a <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-watchlist" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch9-span-5"

                                            for 10 consecutive quarters is placed on a watch list. Dexicos offers the

                                    always have a suitable replacement fund ready if an offered fund underperforms.
                                    If a fund on a watch list is later removed, the replacement fund takes

                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch9-p-60">Typically, companies have procedures for placing a fund on a watch list
                                    and for removing it as an offering. For insurers, such a procedure usually
                                    requires notifying all parties affected by the action, including fund managers
                                    and separate account customers. When replacing a fund option, an insurer
                                    typically moves all of the money invested in the removed fund to the fund
                                    replacing it.</p>
