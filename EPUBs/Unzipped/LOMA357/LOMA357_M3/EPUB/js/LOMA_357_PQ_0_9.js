arrAnswerFeedback[3] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Style drift is the divergence of a portfolio from its stated investment objective or style. If style drift occurs because portfolio managers are chasing better performance, the portfolio’s actual risk-return profile may not match the intended profile described in the IPS. Style drift could result in a portfolio that no longer meets an investor’s objectives, and is therefore, no longer a suitable investment. Investment professionals monitor portfolios for signs of style drift.</p><p class=\"explanations\">Actively managed funds typically trade more frequently, which provides them with more opportunities to deviate from their stated investment styles. However, passively managed funds can also drift over time. For instance, a passively managed small-cap stock fund may hold stocks that gradually increase in value enough to become classified as mid-cap stocks. If the fund continues to hold such stocks, its portfolio will drift from its small-cap focus.</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 9A.

arrAnswerFeedback[1] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Jensen’s alpha is a risk-adjusted measure of alpha that factors in the portfolio’s beta to determine whether the portfolio generated positive returns as compensation for the investment risk it assumed. The Sharpe, Sortino, and information ratios use standard deviation as their measure of risk, which means that they evaluate returns in relation to the portfolio’s combination of systematic and specific risk. Jensen’s alpha uses beta as its measure of risk, which means that it evaluates returns in relation to the portfolio’s systematic risk, or market risk.</p><p class=\"explanations\">The Jensen’s alpha formula can be expressed as: Portfolio’s actual rate of return – (Risk-free rate of return + [Portfolio’s beta × {Rate of market return – Risk-free rate of return}]). If you know the portfolio’s actual rate of return, use the following formula: Portfolio’s actual rate of return – Portfolio’s expected rate of return = Jensen’s alpha. If the Jensen’s alpha value is positive, then the portfolio’s return has outperformed its expected risk-adjusted return. If the value is negative, then the portfolio has underperformed relative to expectations.</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 9E.
