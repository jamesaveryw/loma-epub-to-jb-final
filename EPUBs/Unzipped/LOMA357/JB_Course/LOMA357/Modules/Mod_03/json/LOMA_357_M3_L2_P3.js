As this statement describes the portfolio’s SAA, the IPS also provides a range of permissible values around the target percentage for each asset class. The values at the low and high ends of the range—known as <em>range limits</em>—allow a portfolio’s actual allocations to deviate from the SAA up to a certain point. Portfolio managers can make tactical decisions to overweight or underweight asset classes as long as the new allocation of an asset class remains within the acceptable range limits."

In a rising interest-rate environment, the investor is reinvesting principal from bonds with lower rates into comparable bonds with higher rates, thus gradually earning more interest income from the bond ladder."

Laddering pays off in a rising interest-rate environment; principal from each maturing bond is reinvested at a higher coupon rate. In a decreasing interest-rate environment, however, the investor is steadily reinvesting principal into bonds with progressively lower coupon rates. If interest rates fall far enough, the investor may be forced to reinvest in a bond with a coupon rate that is lower than the coupon rate received by his recently matured bond. If this situation continues, the investor will gradually earn less interest income from the bond ladder. In such a scenario, the investor would have been better off holding the initial bonds for longer terms to maturity, thus receiving more coupon payments at the higher rates."
