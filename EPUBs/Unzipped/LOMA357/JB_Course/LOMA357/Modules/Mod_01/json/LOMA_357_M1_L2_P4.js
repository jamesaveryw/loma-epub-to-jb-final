A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">bond</span> is a security that represents a debt that the borrower—the issuer of the bond—owes to the <em>bondholder</em>—the person or company that buys and owns the bond. Essentially, the bondholder lends money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments and future repayment of the loan. Because interest payments generally provide a predictable stream of income to the bondholder, bonds are considered <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">fixed-income investments</span>."

In addition to bonds, investors also calculate yields for other types of income-generating investments. You will read about bond yields and other return calculations in Chapter 4."

As the table earlier in this chapter shows, bonds are a significant portion of life insurers’ investment holdings. Bonds are particularly suitable for life insurers’ general account portfolios because insurers have long-term liabilities, need to protect capital, and experience regular cash outflows. In addition, bonds help with asset-liability management because insurers can match the cash flows of bonds with the cash flows of their liabilities. We explain how bonds meet insurance company needs in later chapters."
