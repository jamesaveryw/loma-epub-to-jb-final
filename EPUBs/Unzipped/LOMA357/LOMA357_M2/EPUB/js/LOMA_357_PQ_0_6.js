arrAnswerFeedback[0] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Investment professionals who use an interest-rate anticipation strategy trade fixed-income securities in anticipation of estimated future changes in market interest rates. This strategy has the objectives of preserving capital when interest rates are increasing and achieving capital appreciation when interest rates are decreasing.</p><p class=\"explanations\">When investment professionals expect interest rates to decrease, they should take steps to increase a portfolio’s duration, thus positioning the portfolio for larger gains in market value as rates decrease. When investment professionals expect interest rates to increase, they should take steps to reduce a portfolio’s duration, thus positioning the portfolio for smaller losses in market value as rates increase.</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 6H.
