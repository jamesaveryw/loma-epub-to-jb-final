                    <p>One key performance indicator is a line chart that illustrates the projected
                        and actual changes in a portfolio’s market values over a period of time.
                        Another key performance indicator is a gauge that indicates how much investment
                        income the portfolio has earned year-to-date as compared to its target
                        amount for the year.</p>
                    <p>One key risk indicator is a pie chart that indicates the percent of a
                        bond portfolio’s holdings that are investment grade. The chart also indicates
                        the target percentage of investment-grade holdings. Another key risk indicator
                        is an indicator that displays the acceptable range of the standard deviation
                        of a portfolio’s annual rate of return. The indicator shows what the current
                        standard deviation is and whether it is within the acceptable range.</p>

                    <p>There are three main steps for creating a replicating portfolio. Step
                        one is to identify assets that exhibit the risk and return characteristics
                        of the pool of liabilities.</p>
                    <p>Step two is to select market indexes that display the relevant characteristics
                        of the selected asset classes.</p>
                    <p>Step three is to assemble the market indexes in suitable proportions to
                        form a virtual portfolio.</p>
