                    protection and current income objectives because the insurer needs to have

                    requirements. However, the portfolio also has a capital growth objective

                            <p class="explanations">Rebalancing is the process of periodically adjusting the percentage of
                                funds invested in a particular asset class in an investment portfolio to
                                ensure that the portfolio continues to contain the desired asset allocation.</p>

                                and 45% bonds. Its actual allocation of 70% stocks is too high, and its
                                actual allocation of 30% bonds is too low. Therefore, the Baron Fund needs
                                rebalancing to return to its intended asset allocation. Once the fund manager
                                sells enough stock shares and purchases enough bonds, the percentages will
                                be back in line with the intended asset allocation—55% stocks and 45% bonds—and
                                the portfolio rebalancing will be complete.</p>

                                    outlines a set of formal rules and guidelines for investing. The corporate

                                    of an institutional investor. However, an institutional investor’s IPS
                                    typically includes the following elements: portfolio return and risk objectives;

                                        investment strategy because it provides parameters. A formalized plan can

                                of a risk impact. For instance, a portfolio’s derivatives allocation is
                                a KRI; the portfolio exceeds its risk tolerance if the percentage of assets
                                made up of derivatives is greater than the stated limit of 5%.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">A KPI indicates success for a specified process or activity that is critical
                                to the success of an organization. KPI attributes include a target performance
                                value, the currently achieved value, and identifiable trends. A KPI indirectly
                                addresses risk appetite. For instance, a portfolio’s annual rate of return
                                target is an investment KPI; setting a target of 10% signals that a company
                                has a strong appetite for investment risk.</p>

                            <p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, state regulators may require insurers to invest
                                only in bonds that achieve a specific designation assigned by the NAIC.
                                The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) is the NAIC department that assesses
                                the credit quality of the fixed-income investments of insurance companies
                                and assigns designations and valuations to such investments. In this rating
                                system, the highest quality investments receive a designation of <strong>(NAIC 1 / NAIC 6)</strong>.
                                The NAIC considers its ratings to be (<strong>public / regulatory</strong>)
                                ratings.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">The NAIC’s rating system comprises six rating classes, ranging from NAIC&#160;1—which
                                represents the best rating—to NAIC&#160;6, which represents investments
                                of the lowest quality (highest risk of default). NAIC&#160;1-&#160;NAIC&#160;2
                                are investment grade ratings for long-term bonds. In the United States,
                                state regulators may require that insurers only invest in bonds that achieve
                                a specific designation assigned by the NAIC.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">The NAIC considers its ratings to be regulatory ratings because they are
                                intended for statutory accounting and financial reporting purposes in the
                                United States. NAIC designations are not intended to aid investment decision
                                making. In reality, however, an insurer’s investment professionals will
                                consider NAIC designations along with agency credit ratings when evaluating
                                potential bond purchases. NAIC designations and valuations are particularly
                                important for investments that are not actively traded and are not rated
                                by external credit rating agencies, such as private placement securities.</p>

                                a comprehensive framework for risk management. In addition to identifying
                                risks, ERM involves prioritizing risks based on potential losses, planning
                                responses to potential threats, and monitoring corporate progress on controlling
                                risks.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">The ALM function monitors an insurer’s liquidity and is responsible for
                                ensuring that the company always has enough cash available to pay its obligations
                                on time. ALM also ensures the company remains solvent by monitoring cash-flow
                                issues that could cause significant financial losses over time. Thus, ALM
                                is an important component of an insurance company’s capital management
                                practices.</p>

                                <p class="explanations">Sensitivity analysis measures the responsiveness of the outputs produced
                                    by a mathematical model to changes in the values of the model’s input variables.
                                    Insurers can apply sensitivity analysis to an entire portfolio or to just
                                    a portfolio segment.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">Asset and liability durations do not stay constant, so investment professionals
                                have to make periodic adjustments to keep durations matched. For assets
                                and liabilities with long durations, duration matching is particularly
                                important because their market values are more sensitive to market interest-rate
                                changes. Life insurers may have trouble finding assets with durations long
                                enough to match the long durations of certain liabilities, such as contractual
                                obligations for whole life insurance and annuity products.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Another drawback of duration matching is that it does not appropriately
                                address insurer cash flow needs. For example, even when the asset and liability
                                durations are matched, the asset cash inflows could be insufficient to
                                match the liability cash outflows, which would threaten the insurer’s surplus.</p>
