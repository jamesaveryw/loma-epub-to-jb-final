                            costs—an increase in the portfolio’s asset values generally decreases the

                                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-260">Based on the<em> Investment Company Act of 1940</em>—which you will learn
                                    about in Chapter 10—the SEC considers UITs, like open-end and closed-end
                                    mutual funds, to be a form of an investment company. In addition, the SEC
                                    typically classifies insurance company separate accounts as UITs because
                                    of their legal structure (the full explanation is beyond the scope of this
                                    text). Therefore, most separate accounts are registered with the SEC as
