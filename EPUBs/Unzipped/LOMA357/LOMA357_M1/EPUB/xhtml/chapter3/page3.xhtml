                id="loma357-ch3-span-9" role="doc-glossref">structured security</span>—also
                known as <em>structured debt</em> or a <em>structured debt security</em>—is
                an investment vehicle that repackages pools of existing debt obligations
                into a new form of financial security that is tradeable and generally promises
                investors a stream of payments. Because they are tradeable, structured
                securities are used to provide liquidity to groups of illiquid loans, including
                mortgages.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-33">In general, structured securities are not traded on exchanges. Most trading
                of structured securities occurs in <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-overthecountermarkets"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch3-span-10" role="doc-glossref">over-the-counter (OTC) markets</span>,
                which are electronic communications networks over which securities that
                are not bought and sold on an exchange are traded. Typically, securities
                traded in OTC markets are less liquid than securities traded on exchanges.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-34">As fixed-income investments, structured securities generally provide investors
                with fairly predictable income payments. Structured securities can also
                offer higher yields than similarly rated bonds. In addition, structured
                securities help institutional investors diversify their portfolios.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-35">The risk associated with a particular structured security depends on the
                    credit quality of its loan pool and its repackaging. Furthermore, structured
                    securities are usually less liquid and harder for investors to evaluate
                    than bonds.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch3-p-36">The process of purchasing, combining, and repackaging debt into structured
                        securities is called <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-securitization"

                        Note that while securitization bundles debt to create a new security, the
                        process does not change the riskiness of the underlying pool of debt. Figure
                        3.1 illustrates the securitization process.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-38">To securitize debt, a loan originator typically creates a special purpose
                        entity. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-specialpurposeentity" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma357-ch3-span-14" role="doc-glossref">special purpose entity (SPE)</span>,
                        also known as a <em>special purpose vehicle</em>, is a business organization
                        that is formed for a specific purpose and usually for a limited time. The
                        SPE buys a package of loans to be securitized. Then, the SPE takes actions
                        to enhance the credit profile of the structured securities it intends to
                        issue.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-39">As part of <em>credit enhancement</em>, the SPE typically divides the securities
                        into several ownership classes, known as <em>tranches</em>—“tranche” is
                        the French word for slice. Each tranche is a different tier or layer of
                        the structured security, and each represents a distinct packaging of investment
                        traits—such as cash flow patterns, credit quality, investment risks, and
                        priority given to owners.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-40">Although other tranche configurations are possible, most securitized debt
                        has the following four tranches, in order of seniority:</p>
                    <ul class="list"
                    id="loma357-ch3-ul-8">
                        <li id="loma357-ch3-li-33">
                            <p id="loma357-ch3-p-41">The <em>AAA debt tranche</em> is the most senior tranche, meaning it has
                                the highest claim priority on the debt pool’s cash flows. Of all tranches
                                in a structured security, it is the most creditworthy, the first to collect
                                payments from borrowers, and the first to make payments to investors. For
                                these reasons, the interest rate for this tranche of a structured security
                                tends to be lower than on lower tranches of the same security. For the
                                same reasons, investing in this tranche is very attractive to life insurers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma357-ch3-li-34">
                            <p id="loma357-ch3-p-42">The <em>AA debt tranche</em> is the second-most-senior tranche. It is second
                                to collect payments from borrowers, and second to make payments to investors.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma357-ch3-li-35">
                            <p id="loma357-ch3-p-43">The <em>A debt tranche</em>—also known as the <em>subordinated debt tranche</em>—is
                                the third tranche and has the lowest priority of the three debt tranches.
                                It is third to collect payments from borrowers, and third to make payments
                                to investors. Because the A debt tranche is considered riskier than the
                                AAA and AA tranches, it tends to have a higher interest rate than the more
                                senior tranches.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p id="loma357-ch3-p-44">The <em>equity tranche</em> is the lowest tranche in a structured security.
                                It has last priority for payment relative to other tranches. The equity
                                tranche is considered the riskiest tranche; due to its low payment priority,
                                it is the most likely to be affected by loan defaults and late payments
                                by borrowers. However, it also has the potential to earn the highest rate
                                of return because it receives all remaining cash after the other tranches
                                have received their payments. Thus, if the structured security’s debt pool
                                experiences fewer defaults and late payments than expected, the equity
                                tranche will receive more money than expected.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-49">Structured securities are rated by credit rating agencies. The practice
                        of establishing tranches—some having seniority, while others are subordinated—enhances
                        the credit quality of the senior tranche. Frequently, issuers of structured
                        securities undertake credit enhancements to increase the credit ratings
                        of their securities; higher credit ratings can increase the securities’
                        appeal to investors.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-50">After establishing tranches, the SPE issues and sells shares in the structured
                        securities to investors, including life insurance companies and other institutional
                        investors. Each structured security represents an ownership interest in
                        the underlying loans. For a fee, the loan originator—or a third party—collects
                        incoming payments on the original loans and distributes the scheduled payouts
                        to the investors in the structured securities.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-51">Securitization creates liquidity for loan originators by enabling them
                        to transfer loans to SPEs. However, the transferring of debt obligations
                        can decrease loan originators’ exposure to default risks, which arguably
                        motivates them to issue more debt than they normally would.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma357-ch3-p-52">As you will read in Chapter 4, structured securities played a role in
                        the 2007-2008 global financial crisis due to factors such as lower mortgage
                        lending standards, the complexity of securitization, and insufficient risk
                        assessment by credit rating agencies. Since then, structured securities
                        have received more scrutiny from regulators.</p>

                        a structured security backed by debt instruments other than real estate
                        mortgages. Lenders use ABSs to convert packages of relatively illiquid
                        loans—such as auto loans, credit card debt (also called <em>credit card receivables</em>),
                        student loans, and home equity loans—into tradeable, liquid securities.</p>

                    class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-55">The riskiness of an ABS depends on the creditworthiness of the underlying
                        debts. Therefore, credit rating agencies rate ABS tranches based on creditworthiness,
                        probability of default, and any credit enhancements.</p>

                                        are pooled and transferred to an SPE. In the SPE, the securities are divided

                                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-94">Like residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed
                                        securities can be categorized as either agency or nonagency, depending
                                        on whether the underlying mortgages meet an agency’s guidelines. Agency
                                        CMBSs support certain types of borrowers—such as owners of multifamily
                                        properties or health care properties—that are aligned with a particular
                                        agency’s public policy goals.</p>
                                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch3-p-95">CMBSs issued in the United States have limited prepayment risk because
                                        they include make-whole provisions that discourage prepayments. A <em>make-whole provision</em> compensates
                                        CMBS holders by requiring the borrower to (1) purchase substitute collateral—usually
                                        a portfolio of high-quality securities, such as treasuries—for the CMBS
                                        that generates enough cash to replace the cash flows lost because of prepayment,
