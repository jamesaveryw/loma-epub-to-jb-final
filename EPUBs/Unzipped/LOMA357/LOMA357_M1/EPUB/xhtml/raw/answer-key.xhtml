                                and analysis on their own. Because of trading costs, retail investors usually
                                trade less frequently than institutional investors, and typically pay a

                                as variable life insurance and variable annuities. For a separate account
                                product, an insurer sets up an individual account linked to the customer,
                                and the customer has a direct interest in the investment performance of
                                the assets supporting the account. The customer typically elects to allocate
                                her premium payments into at least one of several investment fund options,
                                called subaccounts.</p>

                                insurance products, such as whole life insurance or fixed annuity products.
                                Unlike general account products, the customer—not the insurer—bears most

                                    deploy them to gather large quantities of data. However, many companies
                                    find it more efficient to use external vendors to acquire data for their
                                    analysts. Some vendors also provide services to organize and analyze the
                                    data they collect.</p>
                                <p class="explanations">Outsourcing is particularly attractive to companies that lack the internal
                                    expertise to manage specific types of assets. An effective internal control
                                    system separates the custodial, authorization, and accounting tasks associated
                                    with a company’s assets. Institutional investors often use an external
                                    provider for custodial tasks to comply with the need for internal controls.</p>

                        <p class="explanations">Bonds can be either secured or unsecured. A secured bond is a bond in
                            which the issuer pledges something of value—called collateral—to guarantee
                            the safety of the bondholder’s investment. Secured bondholders typically
                            have first priority in satisfying their claims against a defaulted issuer’s
                            collateral.</p>
                        <p class="explanations">Thus, secured bonds typically are senior bonds, because senior bonds have
                            a higher claim priority than other bonds from the same issuer in the event
                            of the issuer’s default. If the bond issuer does not have any outstanding
                            secured bonds, senior unsecured bondholders have a higher claim priority
                            on the issuer’s assets than subordinated unsecured bondholders.</p>

                                method—referring to recent selling prices for other properties that have
                                similar characteristics—to estimate the price a buyer would be willing
                                to pay for the property in current market conditions.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">In a value-in-use appraisal, also known as a use value appraisal, an appraiser
                                estimates a property’s value to a particular user. Sometimes a property
                                is dedicated to a particular use or has special benefits. An investment
                                value appraisal assumes that an investor is making the best use of the
                                property. This appraisal approach usually results in higher values than
                                market value appraisals.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">In an insurance value appraisal, also known as a replacement value appraisal,
                                the appraiser estimates the amount an insurance company would potentially
                                cover under property insurance if all buildings and fixtures on a property
                                were destroyed. Because an insurance value appraisal excludes the value
                                of the land, this appraisal is typically lower than a market value appraisal,
                                value-in-use appraisal, or an investment value appraisal.</p>

                            balances to be amortizing—amortization is the reduction of a debt by regular

                            by the maturity date—at a steady rate. Mortgage lenders develop amortization

                                reflects both principal and interest are known as <strong>(amortizing / nonamortized)</strong> loans.

                    ABS amortizing loans include auto loans and home loans. Nonamortized loans—for
                    which minimum repayments typically consist only of interest, with repayment
                    of principal required by the end of the loan’s term—include credit card

                            <p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. The three main agencies that participate in the
                                creation of agency MBSs are the Government National Mortgage Association
                                (GNMA), known as Ginnie Mae; the Federal National Mortgage Association
                                (FNMA), known as Fannie Mae; and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
                                (FHLMA), known as Freddie Mac.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Ginnie Mae explicitly backs its MBSs with the full faith and credit of
                                the U.S. government. Because Ginnie Mae guarantees the payment of principal
                                and interest, its MBSs are considered safer than other agency MBSs. Although
                                agency MBSs from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are less secure than Ginnie
                                Mae MBSs, the U.S. government has signaled that it will not allow the two
                                entities to fail, thus ensuring they will satisfy their obligations to
                                investors. Because of this “implicit guarantee,” investors consider Fannie
                                Mae and Freddie Mac to be government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).</p>

                            class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Nonagency MBSs, also known as nonagency mortgage-backed
                                securities or private-label MBSs, are securities based on portfolios of
                                residential mortgages that do not qualify for agency MBSs. Nonagency MBSs
                                are issued by private business entities, such as investment banks, financial
                                institutions, and home builders.</p>

                    <p class="explanations">A CMBS is secured by a pool of commercial mortgages of varying size, property
                        type, and location, that are pooled and transferred to a SPE. CMBSs can
                        be categorized as either agency or nonagency, depending on whether the
                        underlying mortgages meet an agency’s guidelines. Although insurers are
                        major investors in CMBSs, they typically hold a larger percentage of MBSs
                        in their portfolios than CMBSs.</p>
                    <p class="explanations">A make-whole provision, which limits prepayment risk, compensates CMBS
                        holders by requiring the borrower to (1) purchase substitute collateral—usually
                        a portfolio of high-quality securities, such as Treasuries—for the CMBS
                        that generates enough cash to replace the cash flows lost because of prepayment,
                        or (2) pay the holders a penalty. As a result, cash flows associated with
                        CMBSs are reasonably predictable.</p>

                                of outstanding shares. When an investor redeems shares, the company buys
                                back the investor’s shares, which decreases the total number of outstanding
                                shares. The price per share is equal to the NAV that was calculated at

                                    market. In a public offering, the security issuer makes a new security
                                    available for sale to the public, usually through the services of an investment
                                    bank.</p>
                                <p class="explanations">In a firm commitment contract, an investment bank enters into an agreement
                                    to buy all newly issued securities from the issuer, and accepts the risk
                                    that it may sell the issue at a price below the price that it paid. When
                                    the investment bank sells issues of securities on a best efforts basis,
                                    the bank does not first purchase the bonds or shares from the issuer. The
                                    best efforts basis protects the bank in the event that it cannot sell all
                                    of the issue. Any unsold shares or bonds are returned to the issuer.</p>

                                    The ask price is the price at which a seller is willing to sell a share.

                                    auction-based network.</p>
                                <p class="explanations">In a dealer-based market, dealers act as market makers. Dealers publicly
                                    post bid and ask prices for the securities in their inventory. Buyers and
                                    sellers can conduct trades immediately because market makers agree to trade
                                    at published bid and ask prices. In the United States, the National Association
                                    of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) is an example of a

                                may want to calculate a bond’s yield for a shorter length of time, such
                                as one year. To determine a bond’s one-year yield, investors calculate
                                its current yield: the formula is Annual coupon payment ÷ Current market
                                price = Current yield. In this situation, ($1,000 ×.03) ÷ $1,050 = 2.86%.</p>

                                than the 3% coupon rate, as in this situation. Conversely, when the bond
                                is trading at a discount to par value, the current yield is higher than
                                the 3% coupon rate.</p>

                                rise, which will decrease bond market values and increase bond yields.
                                A normal yield curve also signals expectations of healthy economic growth,
                                as rising interest rates are generally associated with periods of rising
                                economic growth. A flat or practically flat yield curve signals that investors
                                do not expect future interest-rate increases or cannot determine the direction
                                of future interest-rate changes.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Many investors see an inverted yield curve as a sign of an impending economic
                                recession—a period of significant decline in economic activity, lasting
                                more than a few months—because interest rates fall when an economy is weak.
                                Bonds with longer terms to maturity become more desirable than bonds with
                                shorter terms. Decreased demand for short-term bonds decreases their market
                                values, thus increasing their yields.</p>

                                affect investment returns. The stated rate of return on an investment without

                                is increasing or decreasing its production of goods and services. Economic
                                activity grows during the <strong>(expansion / peak)</strong> phase and shrinks

                            <p class="explanations">The value of an investment return is affected by the value of money. As
                                such, an investment’s rate of return in a particular year can be adjusted
                                by the rate of inflation in that year. The relationship between the nominal
                                rate of return, the inflation rate, and the real rate of return, is expressed
                                in the formula, solving for the nominal rate of return: Real rate of return
                                + Inflation rate = Nominal rate of return.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">The business cycle is a recurring pattern of fluctuations in economic
                                activity that is characterized as expansion, peak, contraction, and trough.
                                During the expansion phase, security valuations usually rise as businesses
                                profit from increases in economic activity. The market values of some assets—such
                                as stocks and real estate—can appreciate significantly, which makes them
                                more appealing to investors. During the contraction phase, the weakening
                                economy usually prompts investors to seek out conservative investments,
                                such as bonds and dividend-paying stocks.</p>

                                For an institutional investor, an organizational value for the required
                                rate of return takes into account the organization’s growth goals and the
                                minimum rate of return needed to sustain the business.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">The risk-free rate of return is the rate of return on a “risk-free” investment—that
                                is, the least risky investment opportunity available in the market.</p>
                            <p
                            class="explanations">The risk premium is the portion of the rate of return in excess of the
                                risk-free rate of return that is required to compensate an investor for
                                taking the extra risk associated with a specific type of investment. The
                                risk premium for an equity security typically is higher than the risk premium
                                for a debt security.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">The arithmetic mean annual return is the average return—usually expressed
                                as a percentage rate of return—of a series of annual investment returns
                                during a multiyear holding period. The formula for calculating arithmetic
                                mean annual return for an investment is (Year 1 return + Year 2 return
                                + ... Final year<em> </em>return) ÷ Total number of years = Arithmetic
                                mean annual return. In this situation, the arithmetic mean annual return
                                for the investment over three years is (3% + 4% + 5%) ÷ 3 = 4%.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">The arithmetic mean annual return can be misleading because the calculated
                                value implies a steady rate of return for each year. This simple calculation
                                does not indicate the variability of returns in relation to the calculated
                                average. Thus, the measure is not commonly used in investment performance
                                calculations.</p>

                                volatility means that an investor might not receive the average return
                                in a given year, although the investor does receive the potential to earn
                                above-average returns in any given year. For investment returns, the preferred
                                measure of volatility is standard deviation.</p>

                                range is called a confidence interval. A confidence interval signifies
                                the level of confidence that an investor has that an actual return will

                <p class="explanations">In a normal distribution curve, the areas containing values that are more
                    than three standard distributions from the mean are called tails. Because
                    three standard deviations from the mean encompasses approximately 99% of
                    the estimated outcomes in a normal distribution, a low probability exists
                    that a return will fall outside the expected range of outcomes.</p>
                <p class="explanations">Such extreme return outcomes are tail risks, which generally signify risks
                    of low-probability but high-impact occurrences. Return values that are
                    far above the mean—indicating huge gains—are welcome, while values that
                    are far less than the mean—indicating huge losses—are undesirable. Thus,
                    tail risks have the potential to result in large financial losses on investments.</p>

                                the relevant risk can be reduced in an investment portfolio through diversification.
                                A systematic risk—also known as a nondiversifiable risk or market risk—has
                                a broad, similar effect on all elements in an economic system and cannot
                                be eliminated through diversification. Within a given market, every investment
                                is exposed to a systematic risk. Systematic risks include asset bubbles,
                                monetary policy changes, inflation, business cycles, and natural disasters.</p>

                                by diversification. A specific risk is associated with an individual company
                                or industry, but not an entire market. Specific risks include interest-rate

                        markets, banking systems, and currencies and (2) can result in a systemic
                        crisis, which is a series of adverse events occurring in a significant
                        number of financial institutions or markets that has a catastrophic effect.</p>
                    <p
                    class="explanations">A systematic risk can affect an entire market, but a systemic risk threatens
                        to take down an entire interconnected financial system. Thus, only a particular
                        type of systematic risk—such as an asset bubble in real estate prices—can
                        also be a systemic risk.</p>
                        <p class="explanations">The “price of admission” to participate in a given market is exposure
                            to its systematic risks; thus, investors need risk premiums as incentives
                            to participate in markets. However, because well-managed investment portfolios
                            mitigate exposure to specific risks, investors do not require risk premiums
                            to invest in assets that are subject to those risks.</p>

                                        loans—the market value of an existing investment will decrease as market
                                        interest rates increase, and increase as market interest rates decrease.
                                        For instance, in rising interest-rate environments, current issues of bonds
                                        typically fall in market value because new issues will be offered at higher
                                        coupon rates, which are more attractive to investors. In such cases, an
                                        investor can hold existing bonds to maturity, rather than selling them
                                        at unfavorable market values. Note that life insurance companies generally
                                        purchase bonds and other debt securities with the intention of holding
                                        them to maturity.</p>

                                    <p class="explanations">In a period of increasing market interest rates, insurance companies can
                                        experience margin compression, which refers to the narrowing of an insurer’s
                                        interest margin. Typically, when market interest rates are rising, policyowners
                                        immediately demand a higher crediting rate on their accounts. If the company
                                        immediately pays the new higher rate on its products, the company’s interest
                                        margin will narrow.</p>
                                    <p class="explanations">If the company does not pay the new higher rate, the company will likely
                                        lose customers and business from financial professionals. To minimize the
                                        risk of margin compression, insurers typically try to issue products that
                                        limit customer withdrawal rights during early years. Margin compression
                                        also comes into play during periods of decreasing market interest rates
                                        if asset maturities are not properly aligned with the average life of the

                                        mortgage-backed securities—whose value depends on real estate property
