<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-30">An <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-investment" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-4" role="doc-glossref">investment</span> is any use of an investor’s resources that is intended to generate a positive return of some kind. Examples of investable resources include time, energy, and money. For the purposes of this text, we focus on the investment of financial resources, known as <em>capital</em>. In the context of investing, <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-capital" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-5" role="doc-glossref">capital</span>is a financial resource available to initiate an investment.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-31">Investors strive to use capital productively to create additional value or wealth. For instance, companies invest capital now in projects that will grow their business in the future, and individuals invest capital now to have more money available later for spending.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma357-ch1-div-10">
<p class="example-header" id="loma357-ch1-p-32">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma357-ch1-div-11">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-33"><strong>Example 1</strong>: Camion Industrial Corporation, a company that manufactures building equipment, is not manufacturing equipment quickly enough to meet customer demand. To increase production capacity, Camion invests money in a project to build an additional manufacturing plant. Once complete, the plant will enable the company to supply more equipment to customers.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-34"><strong>Example 2</strong>: Annabelle Boneca, an employee at Camion, regularly puts some of her monthly salary into a savings account intended to cover her anticipated living expenses during retirement. At her current savings rate, Annabelle estimates that her total savings will not grow fast enough to meet her retirement needs. So, she invests additional savings in the stock market with the expectation that these investments will provide her with extra money that she can use to reach her savings goal.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-53">Based on research and analysis of multiple factors, an investor develops an estimation of an asset’s value. Keep in mind that value and price are not necessarily the same thing. To an investor,<em> price</em> is what you can buy or sell an asset for, while <em>value</em> is what you believe the asset is worth.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-54">An investor believes that an asset’s price will eventually rise or fall over time to meet his interpretation of the asset’s value. Therefore, an investor’s assessment of an asset’s value influences the investor’s actions in the marketplace for that asset. For example, if an investor believes an asset is more valuable than the current price indicates, then the investor should consider purchasing the asset to benefit from the anticipated future increase in the asset’s price.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-55">To understand what investing is, let’s consider what investing is not. First, investing is not the same as saving. A saver sets aside money to avoid spending it right now. In other words, a saver defers spending some of her money until a later point in time.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-56">Typically, the amount of money a saver has increases when she contributes additional money to her savings. In addition, the saver can receive interest income if the money is held in an interest-earning account—such as a <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-savingsaccount" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-9" role="doc-glossref">savings account</span>, which pays interest on deposited funds, typically from the day of deposit to the day of withdrawal. If the savings are held elsewhere, such as in a personal safe or under a mattress, the saver does not earn interest.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-57">In contrast, an investor takes capital and puts it to work by investing in assets. If an asset’s price rises above the investor’s purchase price, the investment has gained in value. Once an asset has been sold for a gain, the investor earns a <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-returnoninvestment" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-10" role="doc-glossref">return on investment</span>, or a profit earned on invested capital during a defined time period. Furthermore, an investor may—depending on the type of investment—receive payments from an investment. Such payments, which you will learn more about in Chapter 2, represent income to the investor.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-58">Investment gains and investment income both increase the amount of money the investor has. However, asset prices fluctuate, so investments can lose value; selling an asset for a loss causes the investor to lose money.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-59">As investors can potentially lose their invested capital, investing is generally riskier than saving. To compensate investors for the increased level of risk, the potential rates of return on investments are generally higher than the interest rates on savings accounts.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-60">Because of the potential for investment gains and income, an investor has the opportunity to increase his accumulation of funds faster than he would by saving. Therefore, we can sum up the main difference between saving and investing in the following statements:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma357-ch1-ul-8">
	<li id="loma357-ch1-li-32">
	<p id="loma357-ch1-p-61">A saver’s funds typically accumulate through a combination of (1) additional contributions to savings and (2) receipts of interest income (if the money is held in an interest-earning account, such as a savings account).</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma357-ch1-li-33">
	<p id="loma357-ch1-p-62">An investor’s funds typically accumulate through a combination of investment gains, investment income, and additional contributions of money.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-63">Although an investor may engage in speculative or gambling activities, investing is not the same as speculating or gambling.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma357-ch1-div-12">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma357-ch1-h3-1">Investing or Speculating?</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-64">In a financial context, <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-speculation" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-11" role="doc-glossref">speculation</span> is the practice of engaging in a financial transaction—particularly, a risky transaction—with the intent of benefiting from a short-term fluctuation in an asset’s price.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-65">In general, investors consider a wider range of factors over a longer length of time than do speculators. Speculation does not require a careful examination of an asset’s current or projected value. Instead, speculators consider a limited set of factors, such as an asset’s current price and patterns of price changes. Speculators believe they can identify asset trends without having a comprehensive understanding of asset values.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma357-ch1-div-13">
<p class="example-header" id="loma357-ch1-p-66">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma357-ch1-div-14">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-67">Adam Cain is a commodities speculator. Adam notices that, every few years, corn prices spike in the United States. Looking closer, he sees that harsh weather preceded and adversely affected corn production in each year that the price spiked.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-68">At the beginning of the year, Adam observes that the weather in the United States has been colder than the last few years. Remembering the pattern he noticed, Adam thinks that the weather will hurt corn production in the upcoming year. Knowing that a reduced supply would prompt a surge in corn prices, he purchases a contract for 15,000 bushels of corn that locks in the price of the bushels for six months.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-69"><strong>Analysis</strong>: If the price of corn rises during the six-month period, the contract becomes more valuable and Adam can sell it to a corn buyer for a profit. Therefore, by purchasing the contract now, Adam is positioning himself to benefit if the price of corn increases.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-70">Investors and speculators also differ in their approach to risk. Investors assess the risk associated with an investment and only accept the risk if the anticipated return is suitable for the level of risk assumed. In general, speculators are willing to take on larger risks in return for the chance of larger rewards. Speculators are also more likely to borrow money to make concentrated bets in the hope of amplifying returns.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-71">Many investors are more conservative than speculators and limit exposure to unnecessary risks. In addition, some investors are subject to regulations that limit the types of investments that they can make. For example, regulators place investment restrictions on insurance companies. Because of regulations involving their use of capital, insurers generally are cautious investors that do not speculate.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-72">Investors tend to hold investments longer than speculators and use different selection methodologies. Investors employ a deliberate, strategic process to carefully select investments to hold for a specific length of time. Speculators are opportunistic, hoping to take advantage of quick movements in an asset’s price. In their rush to exploit a brief window of time, speculators may base decisions on limited information.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma357-ch1-div-15">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma357-ch1-h3-2">Investing or Gambling?</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-73">Investing and speculating are different from <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-gambling" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-12" role="doc-glossref">gambling</span>, which is the act of wagering something of value—such as money—on the outcome of an event involving chance. If a gambler’s bet is successful, he wins a prize. However, if his bet is unsuccessful, the gambler loses the item of value that he wagered.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-74">Many gamblers bet on outcomes that have very low odds of success. For example, you are gambling whenever you buy a lottery ticket. Your ticket usually has unfavorable odds—such as a 1-in-300 million chance—of winning the drawing.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-75">Some gamblers believe that by observing past outcomes, they are able to predict future outcomes of random events. However, in random events—such as coin flips or games of chance—outcomes occur independently, meaning a single outcome is not affected by previous outcomes and does not affect future outcomes. Thus, the <em>gambler’s fallacy</em>, also known as the <em>Monte Carlo fallacy</em>, is the mistaken belief that random events become less random—and more predictable—the more frequently certain outcomes are observed.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma357-ch1-div-16">
<div class="inner" id="loma357-ch1-div-17">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-76"><strong>Why is the gambler’s fallacy also called the Monte Carlo fallacy?</strong></p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-77">A famous example of the gambler’s fallacy occurred on August 18, 1913, at the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco. At one of the roulette tables, some gamblers noticed that the ball kept falling on black.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-78">Even though each spin of the wheel had the same odds of the ball landing on red as earlier spins, the gamblers started to believe that the growing streak increased the odds that the next roll would end with the ball landing on red. As the streak of rolls landing on black continued, more gamblers got involved. With each roll, gamblers placed larger bets on the ball landing on red. However, the ball kept landing on black.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-79">The ball finally landed on red after landing on black twenty-six times in a row. Because of the extremely unlikely occurrence of the streak, gamblers at the roulette table lost millions of francs betting against black.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-80">Because the odds are against them, gamblers typically have to rely on luck to be successful over time. In contrast, speculators and investors apply their skills to increase the likelihood of experiencing favorable outcomes. Speculators who can skillfully spot short-term trends are more likely to capitalize on asset price fluctuations. Investors who can skillfully assess asset values are more likely to select long-term investments that earn positive returns.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-81">Compared to speculators and investors, gamblers have the least amount of control in preventing the loss of committed capital. For a gambler, a bad bet wipes out all of the capital wagered on the bet. Speculators and investors can sell assets before they lose all of their committed capital.</p>
