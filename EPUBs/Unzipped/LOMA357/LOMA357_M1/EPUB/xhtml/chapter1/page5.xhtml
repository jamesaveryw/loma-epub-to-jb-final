<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma357-ch1-h2-6">Insurers as Institutional Investors</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-135">As one of the largest institutional investors in the world, the insurance industry possesses significant investment capital. For instance, at the end of 2016, U.S. insurers reported more than $6.1 trillion of cash and invested assets.<span class="ens" id="loma357-ch1-span-25"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma357-ch1-en1" epub:type="noteref" id="loma357-ch1-span-26" role="doc-noteref">1</span> </span></p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-136">By investing in a wide range of businesses and industries, insurers supply funds that businesses use to engage in productive projects. Thus, insurers help facilitate economic growth around the world.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-137">As institutional investors, insurance companies primarily invest to support their insurance products. Like many financial services companies, insurance companies have an investment function that handles investment activities on behalf of the company.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma357-ch1-div-37">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma357-ch1-h3-5">The Investment Function</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-138">The investment function plays an essential role in the operation of insurance companies. By carefully selecting and prudently managing investments, the investment function helps an insurer cover obligations, protect capital, and increase profits.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-139">For insurers, assets supporting an insurance product need to grow at least as quickly as the product’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-liabilities" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-27" role="doc-glossref">liabilities</span>, which are the current and future financial obligations an insurer has to its customers. For instance, life insurers must grow assets over many years to support the benefits provided under life insurance policies and annuity contracts. By effectively investing an insurer’s assets, the investment function helps the company meet its contractual obligations and strengthens the company’s financial position.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-140">Many types of financial institutions—including life insurance companies, banks, and retirement plans—use <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-assetliabilitymanagement" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-28" role="doc-glossref">asset-liability management (ALM)</span> to coordinate the risks that simultaneously affect the company’s investments and products. Within life insurance companies, ALM coordinates the administration of an insurer’s <em>asset portfolio</em>—its investments—with the administration of its <em>liability portfolio</em>—its obligations to customers—so as to manage risk and still earn an adequate level of return.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-141">Insurance regulators must be able to verify that insurance companies are financially healthy and can meet obligations to their customers and creditors on time. Therefore, solvency regulations set standards for ensuring that insurers hold sufficient assets to support their obligations. Furthermore, regulations require that insurers hold additional capital to offset certain investment risks. We go into further detail about regulations in Chapter 10.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-142">The investment function helps an insurance company meet its capital requirements by growing assets and also takes measures to protect capital from financial risks. You will learn how investment professionals manage financial risks in Chapter 8.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-143">While growing assets to cover liabilities and meet regulatory requirements, the investment function can generate excess investment returns. However, investment professionals must exercise caution to avoid assuming too much risk, which could jeopardize the company’s solvency.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-144">Still, insurance companies count on the investment function to produce additional funds for operational flexibility and profitability. Insurers use the money from excess investment returns for actions such as</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-153">A thriving investment function is beneficial to all of a company’s stakeholders, including its employees. For example, profitable insurers stay in business and can afford to devote more money to providing employee benefits and paying salaries and commissions. Therefore, all insurance company employees have a vested interest in the ongoing success of the investment function.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma357-ch1-div-38">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma357-ch1-h3-6">Movement of Funds</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-154">For an insurance company, most of its investable capital comes from the policy premiums that the company receives. An insurer divides its assets into two main types of accounts—a general account and one or more separate accounts. The movement of funds through the investment process differs depending on whether the funds support the general account portfolio or a separate account portfolio.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma357-ch1-div-39">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma357-ch1-h4-1">General Accounts</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-155">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-generalaccount" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-29" role="doc-glossref">general account</span>, also called a <em>general account portfolio</em>, is a life insurance company investment account in which the insurer maintains assets that support all of the insurer’s contractual obligations for guaranteed insurance products, such as whole life insurance or fixed annuity products. General account assets also support any guarantees found in variable products.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-156">For the general account, the insurance company bears the investment risk and the risk attached to paying the insurance benefits or other product guarantees to customers. Because the customer has a claim to benefits and product guarantees under an insurance or annuity contract, the insurer is responsible for making sound investments that enable it to fulfill its guarantees.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-157">The customer does not have a direct interest in the financial success of general account investments. From the customer’s point of view, as long as the insurer can meet its policy obligations, the customer typically is not concerned with how the company invests the premiums.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-158">When a customer pays a premium for a fully guaranteed product, a portion of the money is usually invested through the company’s general account. Within the general account, the company’s investment function grows the money over time through its investments.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-159">For general accounts, the path of funds is relatively simple. After a customer’s premium is in the company’s accounts, it becomes a part of the funds available for investment professionals to use to purchase assets for the general account.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-160">When an insurance policy’s benefits become payable, the company draws from the general account to pay those benefits. Sometimes, incoming cash flows from investments can fund outgoing cash payments of benefits. Other times, the company may need to sell invested assets to raise the cash for benefit payments.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-161">In addition to death benefits, a life insurer may pay withdrawal benefits, policy loans, premium refunds, and surrender benefits from its general account. The general account is also used to pay for guarantees in variable products, such as guaranteed minimum benefit riders and fixed fund options.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma357-ch1-div-40">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma357-ch1-h4-2">Separate Accounts</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch1-p-162">In addition to offering guaranteed products, life insurance companies offer nonguaranteed products in the form of variable life insurance and variable annuities. To support nonguaranteed products, insurance companies use separate accounts. <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-separateaccounts" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-30" role="doc-glossref">Separate accounts</span>, also called <em>separate account portfolios</em>, are asset accounts that are (1) maintained by an insurer apart from its general account and (2) used to manage the funds associated with the company’s variable products.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-163">The term “separate account” is primarily used in the United States. In Canada, products that combine insurance benefits and investment performance are called <em>segregated funds</em>. Other countries may call such products <em>unit-linked portfolios</em>. For simplicity, this text uses the term “separate accounts” to refer to accounts supporting variable products inside and outside of the United States.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-164">Unlike general account products, the customer—not the company—bears most or all of the investment risk associated with a separate account product. We say “most or all” because a variable product may have contractual guarantees that cushion a customer from portions of the investment risk. For example, a customer’s variable annuity may contain a provision guaranteeing a minimum rate of return for a specified time period, even if the invested assets earn a lower rate than the guaranteed rate during that period. In this example, the guarantee is funded through the general account.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-165">For a separate account product, the insurance company sets up an individual account linked to the customer, and the customer has a direct interest in the investment performance of the assets supporting the account. The customer typically elects to allocate her premium payments into at least one of several investment fund options, called <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-subaccounts" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-31" role="doc-glossref">subaccounts</span>. In addition to subaccounts, many variable products offer a <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-fixedfundoption" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-32" role="doc-glossref">fixed fund option</span>, which guarantees a fixed rate of interest for a specified period of time. Premiums allocated to a fixed fund option are administered and invested with the insurer’s general account.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-166">The insurer tracks the <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-marketvalue" epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch1-span-33" role="doc-glossref">market value</span>—in investing, the current price an asset would sell for in the marketplace—of the subaccounts, and the customer’s account value rises or falls in accordance with the change in the market values of the subaccounts the customer selected. Therefore, the benefit amount of a variable product typically depends directly on the investment performance of the assets in the customer’s account.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-167">When the customer of a variable product pays a premium to the insurance company, part of the money is usually invested with the company’s separate account assets. The insurer uses separate account funds to purchase shares of the specific subaccounts chosen by the customers.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-168">When a policy’s benefits come due, the company typically draws funds from the separate account assets to pay the benefits. Again, money for a guaranteed benefit would come from the general account instead of the separate account.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-169">Similar to the general account, incoming cash flows from separate account investments can fund outgoing cash payments of benefits. If the company needs to sell invested assets to raise cash for benefits, it sells shares of the appropriate subaccounts.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma357-ch1-p-170">The following chart summarizes the differences between an insurer’s general account and separate accounts.</p>
