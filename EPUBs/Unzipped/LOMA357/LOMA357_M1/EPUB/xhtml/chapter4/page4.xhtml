            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma357-ch4-h2-5">Factors Influencing Investment Returns</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-70">Many factors influence investment returns. Some factors are specific to
                an individual investment, such as the issuer’s credit quality. One important
                factor for each investment is an asset’s price—particularly the price the
                investor pays at the time of purchase.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-71">Other factors that influence investment returns affect certain asset classes
                or entire markets. Some of the broad economic factors that influence insurance
                company investment returns are interest rates, inflation, and the business
                cycle.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-72">You will notice that some of these factors are interrelated. For example,
                interest rates and the business cycle often influence each other. Therefore,
                isolating the effect of a particular factor on an investment can be challenging.
                However, you need to understand these basic factors before you encounter
                investment risks later in this chapter.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-73">Investment returns are also affected by taxes and transaction fees. For
                simplicity, we ignore these factors when discussing investment return measurement
                later in this chapter.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-74">One of the most significant factors in determining the return of an investment
                is the price that the investor paid at the time of purchase. For instance,
                two investors who sell the same quantity of the same asset at the same
                sale price will experience different capital gains (or losses) if they
                paid different purchase prices.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-76">Wayne O’Connell sold 100 shares of Hattime Corporation at $50 per share
                        for a total of $5,000, or 100 x $50. He originally bought all of the shares
                        at one time and paid $35 per share, for a total purchase cost of $3,500,
                        or 100 x $35. Therefore, his capital gain on the stock is $1,500, calculated
                        as $5,000 – $3,500, not including transaction costs.</p>
                    <p class="txt-ni"
                    id="loma357-ch4-p-77">Maureen Callahan also sold 100 shares of Hattime Corporation at $50 per
                        share for a total of $5,000, or 100 x $50. However, she bought her shares
                        five months before Wayne. She originally bought all of her shares at one
                        time and paid $20 per share, for a total purchase cost of $2,000, or 100
                        x $20. Her capital gain on the stock is $3,000, calculated as $5,000 –
                        $2,000, not including transaction costs.</p>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-78"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Because Maureen purchased her shares of Hattime
                        at a lower price than Wayne, she realized a larger capital gain, even though
                        both investors sold the same number of shares of the same stock at the
                        same price and at the same time.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-79">In addition to determining the size of a capital gain (or loss), the purchase
                price also determines the yield an investor can expect to earn on an investment.
                As you will read in Chapter 7, using yields to compare different assets
                helps investors evaluate and select investments.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-80">For a bond, the <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-yieldtomaturity" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma357-ch4-span-10" role="doc-glossref">yield to maturity (YTM)</span> is
                the rate of return a bondholder will earn if he holds a bond until maturity.
                Although the calculation for the YTM is beyond the scope of this text,
                you should know that the calculation typically uses a bond’s current market
                price to determine the total rate of return on all cash flows received
                until maturity.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-81">If an investor buys a bond at a price below or above par value, the YTM
                is greater or lower than the bond’s coupon rate. The following insight

                with certain characteristics. For example, using YTM to evaluate a callable
                bond overlooks the risk that the issuer may retire the bond before the
                maturity date. In this case, the investor could look at the bond’s <em>yield to call (YTC)</em>,
                which calculates the yield earned if the bond is held until the first call
                date. Because the YTC could be higher or lower than the YTM, a more conservative
                calculation, <em>yield to worst</em>, calculates the lowest possible yield

                        its current yield fell. Conversely, when the bond’s price fell, its current

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-133">Market interest rates establish the cost of borrowing money in a given
                market. For lenders, interest rates represent the rates of return that
                they expect when they lend to borrowers. Lenders charge higher rates when
                the prospect of repayment by borrowers is less certain, and they charge
                lower rates to borrowers that are more likely to repay their debts.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-134">Interest rates affect the actions of borrowers in an economy. Low interest
                rates spur economic growth by encouraging borrowing. A low cost of borrowing
                helps borrowers raise capital for new projects. As interest rates rise,
                the cost of borrowing increases, which discourages borrowing. If interest
                rates rise high enough, borrowers cut back on assuming debt to initiate
                new projects.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-135">Besides encouraging borrowing, lower interest rates provide an incentive
                    for consumers to decrease saving and increase debt-fueled consumption.
                    For example, when rates are low enough, you may decide to take out an auto
                    loan to buy the new car you have wanted. As rates increase, taking out
                    a loan becomes less appealing.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-136">Higher interest rates encourage saving because people and businesses earn
                    a better rate of return on money put into savings than when rates are lower.
                    Because saving is less risky than other uses of capital, saving is an appealing
                    option for many.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-137">In addition, higher interest rates increase the rate of return that a
                    project has to earn to justify investing capital instead of saving it and
                    earning the market interest rate. When interest rates are higher, fewer
                    projects are able to provide a rate of return in excess of the market interest
                    rate and project investment generally decreases.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-138">Many institutional investors allocate capital to multiple asset classes
                    and move capital between asset classes as market conditions change. Movements
                    in market interest rates are one condition that can cause some asset classes
                    to become more appealing than others.</p>

                    Rather, the central bank sets a <em>benchmark interest rate</em>, and banks
                    and other financial institutions set the interest rates they charge in

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-145">Interest rates affect an economy’s growth prospects, which also affect
                    security valuations. For example, if rising interest rates result in increased
                    borrowing costs for companies, the companies may (1) have a harder time
                    making payments on their debts, which can hurt the market values of their
                    issued bonds and (2) become less profitable, which hurts the market values
                    of their issued stock shares. Falling rates generally have the opposite

                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-152">Because insurance companies typically have significant bond holdings in
                        their investment portfolios, they closely follow interest-rate changes.
                        Later in this chapter, we describe how interest rates pose risks to insurers’
                        investment returns and profitability.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-153">The effect of market interest-rate changes on the prices of stocks is
                        not as clear-cut as on bond prices. Companies in some stock market

                        role="doc-glossref">sectors</span>—categories comprising companies in a particular industry
                            that carry out a similar function within the broader industry—are more
                            sensitive to interest rates than other sectors. For instance, rising interest
                            rates are usually beneficial for financial sector stocks because financial
                            services companies can earn more interest from their lending activities.
                            As another example, falling interest rates are beneficial for the stocks
                            of companies involved in construction and home improvement because low
                            rates spur consumer demand for house purchases and upgrades.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma357-ch4-p-154">Interest-rate changes also affect how investors allocate capital among
                        asset classes. For example, when interest rates are low or falling, investors
                        seeking income-generating investments may not realize a sufficient return
                        by investing in bonds. These investors may turn to <em>bond proxies</em>,
                        which are equity investments that can “act” like bonds by earning reasonably
                        stable returns while earning higher yields than bonds. Two examples of
                        assets that investors consider to be bond proxies are high-yield dividend-paying
                        stocks and REITs. As interest rates rise, bonds become more attractive,
                        and income-seeking investors are likely to move money from bond proxies
                        back into bonds. At the same time, the decreased demand for bond proxies
                        typically decreases their market values.</p>

                        of interest-rate movements. Investors assess the impact of interest rates

                        use government bonds. For example, in the United States, the yields of
                        Treasuries typically provide the basis for a yield curve. In other countries,
                        the basis for yields comes from debt securities issued by that country.

                            short-term yields and long-term yields. Higher long-term yields signal
                            that investors expect interest rates to rise, which will decrease bond
                            market values and increase bond yields. A normal yield curve also signals
                            expectations of healthy economic growth, as rising interest rates are generally
                            associated with periods of rising economic growth.</p>

                            A flat or practically flat yield curve signals that investors do not expect

                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-166">In addition, an inverted yield curve changes investors’ attitudes toward
                            owning long-term bonds. The prospect of decreasing interest rates encourages
                            bond investors to buy bonds with longer terms to maturity, thus ensuring
                            their portfolios will (1) hold bonds with higher coupon rates than those
                            of newly issued bonds in the lower interest-rate environment and (2) benefit
                            from increases in bond market values when market interest rates fall. Therefore,
                            bonds with longer terms to maturity become more desirable than bonds with
                            shorter terms. Decreased demand for short-term bonds decreases their market
                            values, which increases their yields.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-167">Inflation is generally described as a steady increase in prices over time,

                            The rate of inflation expresses the percentage increase in the prices of
                            goods and services during a specific period—typically one year—in a given

                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-171">One of the goals of the Federal Reserve and other central banks is to
                            stabilize the rate of price increases in their economies by moderating
                            the year-to-year rate of inflation. (In addition, moderate rates of inflation
                            are typically associated with steady rates of economic growth.) According
                            to economic theory, increases in the supply of money in an economy can
                            lead to increased inflation in that economy. Therefore, by influencing
                            market interest rates—which affect the supply of money in an economy—central
                            banks should be able to affect inflation rates. In reality, consistently
                            achieving a desired change in the rate of inflation is challenging for
                            any central bank.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-172">Because inflation erodes the value of money in an economy, it can have
                            a meaningful effect on debt securities, such as bonds and mortgages. In
                            an inflationary environment, the burden—from the perspective of borrowers—of
                            a debt amount erodes as the value of money erodes. Over time, the interest
                            payments made by borrowers represent diminishing monetary value for lenders.
                            Therefore, inflation becomes more important the longer an investor holds
                            a debt security. In a <em>deflationary</em> environment, debt represents
                            a greater burden for borrowers and a greater return for lenders.</p>
                        <p
                        class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-173">In addition, the presence of inflation requires an investor to earn a
                            rate of return greater than or equal to the expected inflation rate in
                            order to avoid losing purchasing power. Investors select certain types
                            of assets to act as hedges against inflation. As discussed in Chapter 2,
                            real estate is a popular inflation hedge because property values generally
                            rise as other prices rise in an economy.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-174">The value of an investment return is affected by the value of money. As

                                by the rate of inflation in that year. The stated rate of return on an

                                            Note that recessions and depressions only occur during the contraction
                                            phase. While economists differ in their technical definitions, a recession
                                            is generally an economic downturn lasting between a few months and a couple
                                            of years. A <em>depression</em> is generally a severe economic downturn that
                                            lasts for a period of at least two years. Depressions are less frequent
                                            than recessions; therefore, most economic downturns during the contractionary
                                            phase tend to be recessions.</p>

                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-183">Generally, the business cycle indicates whether a given economy is increasing
                                or decreasing its production of goods and services. Economic activity grows
                                during the expansion phase and shrinks during the contraction phase. The
                                economic growth rate stabilizes and then changes direction at the peak
                                and trough phases; growth begins to fall after the peak phase and begins
                                to rise after the trough phase.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-184">Investors monitor the phases of the business cycle to help them determine
                                how to allocate their capital. During the expansionary phase of the business
                                cycle, security valuations usually rise as businesses profit from increases
                                in economic activity. The market values of some assets—such as stocks and
                                real estate—can appreciate significantly, which makes them more appealing
                                to investors. During the contractionary phase, the weakening economy usually
                                prompts investors to seek out conservative investments, such as bonds and
                                dividend-paying stocks.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-185">The relationship between interest rates, inflation, and the business cycle
                                is complex. For example, sometimes the increases in economic activity and
                                the rate of inflation can prompt a rise in interest rates. Other times,
                                inflation and economic activity respond to interest-rate changes. All three
                                are dynamic market forces that react to each other.</p>
