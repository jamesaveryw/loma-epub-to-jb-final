            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-379">In this chapter, we have discussed investment risk in general terms. Investment
                risks can also be categorized into two types of risks:</p>
            <ul class="list"

                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch4-span-83" role="doc-glossref">systematic risk</span>—also
                        known as a <em>nondiversifiable risk</em> or <em>market risk</em>—has a broad,
                        similar effect on all elements in an economic system and cannot be eliminated
                        through diversification. Within a given market, every investment is exposed
                        to a systematic risk. For instance, the prospect of a shift in a central
                        bank’s monetary policy that leads to a change in market interest rates
                        is a systematic risk to all investments in that market. For a portfolio
                        with investments in multiple countries, an important systematic risk is <em>geopolitical risk</em>,
                        which is the risk that political instability or conflicts between countries
                        adversely affect economic conditions. For example, a war between two neighboring
                        countries is likely to have a negative economic effect on businesses operating
                        in either country.</p>

                        known as a <em>diversifiable risk</em> or <em>unsystematic risk</em>—only
                        affects certain assets or asset classes, and can be substantially reduced
                        by diversification. A specific risk is associated with an individual company
                        or industry, but not an entire market. For instance, the prospect of a
                        new government regulation that affects only the airline industry is a specific
                        risk for airline companies.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-382">The difference between systematic risk and specific risk hinges on whether
                the relevant risk can be reduced in an investment portfolio through diversification.

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-395">Systematic risks are hard to eliminate through diversification because
                these types of risks—many of which have a basis in broad economic conditions—have
                the potential to affect all investments in the marketplace. Diversification
                is intended to spread risk across assets, but if all asset choices are
                subject to the same type of market risk, then diversifying a portfolio
                does not help an investor avoid that risk.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-396">Investors may not be able to avoid systematic risks, but they can hedge
                against them. For instance, an investment portfolio holding certain assets—such
                as bonds—that lose value because of inflation could hedge against that
                risk by purchasing assets—such as real estate properties—that hold or gain
                in value during periods of inflation. In this example, bonds and real estate
                properties are both affected by inflation, but in different ways.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-397">Estimates of expected investment returns incorporate a risk premium for
                systematic risks but not specific risks. The “price of admission” to participate
                in a given market is exposure to its systematic risks; thus, investors
                need risk premiums as incentives to participate in markets. Because well-managed
                investment portfolios mitigate exposure to specific risks, investors do
                not require risk premiums to invest in assets that are subject to those
                risks.</p>

                <h4 id="loma357-ch4-h4-9">Asset Bubbles</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-398">One type of systematic risk that can have a dramatic effect on asset prices
                    is the risk of an asset bubble. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-assetbubble"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch4-span-85" role="doc-glossref">asset bubble</span>,
                    also called a <em>speculative bubble</em> or <em>price bubble</em>, is a phenomenon
                    in which the market values of an entire asset class rise rapidly, so that
                    prices of assets in the class come to greatly exceed their estimated values.
                    Typically, asset price increases are driven by irrational enthusiasm and
                    outpace increases in the asset’s true value.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-399">In an asset bubble, asset prices rise to unsustainably high levels. Asset
                    bubbles can grow—or “inflate”—for many years before prices reach their
                    peaks. Bubbles can be difficult to spot while they are occurring, but one
                    hallmark is a shift in market sentiment, so that most asset owners are
                    speculators. Toward the peak, asset buyers are spurred by a feeling of
                    missing out on gains and hope to ride the continuous upward momentum of
                    prices.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-400">Eventually, investors and other market participants realize that the asset
                    prices in an asset bubble are due to unfounded optimism, and they sell
                    these assets, causing the bubble to “burst.” After the bubble bursts, asset
                    prices decline quickly, which can cause significant—and painful—losses
                    for the asset owners. Widespread asset bubbles can adversely affect an
                    entire economic system.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-401">Asset bubbles have occurred many times throughout history. Notable bubbles
                    range from the Dutch tulip bubble that burst in 1637 to the U.S. housing
                    bubble that burst around 2007. The insight below describes the burst of
                    the U.S. housing bubble in greater detail.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-405">Around 2006, a combination of rising interest rates and defaults among
                            high-risk borrowers with low credit ratings started to cause significant
                            issues for the housing market. As mortgage defaults rose and demand for
                            homes fell, housing values declined, resulting in a ripple effect among
                            asset types related to property values. As a result, the market values
                            of properties, mortgages, and related investments—such as mortgage-backed
                            securities and derivatives—also began to decline rapidly, which jeopardized
                            the solvency of financial institutions that held large amounts of these
                            investments.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-406">In 2007, the asset price decreases caused one prominent investment bank
                            to go bankrupt, prompting concerns about the stability of the entire financial
                            system in the United States. During this time, investors generally abandoned
                            risky assets, selling them in large numbers. Demand for safe assets—such
                            as Treasuries—increased rapidly.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-407">In 2008, the financial crisis spread to other parts of the world, particularly
                            Europe. In addition, the United States experienced a significant recession—one
                            of the worst since the 1930s—that adversely affected the global economy.
                            Worldwide, governments and central banks took extraordinary actions to
                            prevent additional economic shocks, and the financial crisis gradually
                            passed.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-408">Since the 2007–2008 financial crisis, several aspects of housing and finance—including

                            institutions, and sizes of financial institutions—have received additional
                            scrutiny. As a result, regulators have pushed for increased oversight to
                            attempt to prevent the next financial crisis. In addition, central banks
                            actively search for potential asset bubbles.</p>

                    occurring in a significant number of financial institutions or markets
                    that has a catastrophic effect. A systemic crisis results in severe impairment

                    that (1) affects securities markets, banking systems, and currencies, and

                    risks, but the terms are not interchangeable. A systematic risk can affect
                    an entire market, but a systemic risk threatens to take down an entire
                    interconnected financial system. Thus, only a particular type of systematic
                    risk—such as an asset bubble in real estate prices—can also be a systemic
                    risk. Regulatory entities around the world monitor systemic risks in an
                    effort to prevent a systemic crisis from occurring.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-411">As we mentioned earlier, specific risks can be reduced through diversification.
                    One benefit of portfolio diversification is that the impact of the specific
                    risks associated with a single asset is reduced as more assets are included.
                    Businesses face many kinds of specific risks—such as operational risk and
                    reputational risk—but this section focuses on specific risks associated
                    with investments.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-416">For instance, in rising interest-rate environments, current issues of
                    bonds typically fall in market value because new issues will be offered
                    at higher coupon rates, which are more attractive to investors. In such
                    cases, an investor can hold existing bonds to maturity, thus avoiding selling
                    them at unfavorable market values. Note that life insurance companies generally
                    purchase bonds and other debt securities with the intention of holding
                    them to maturity.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-417">Interest-rate risk affects virtually all investments. For example, real
                    estate is subject to interest-rate risk because transactions are usually
                    financed with interest-bearing loans. In addition, some stock market sectors—such
                    as those comprising utility companies or financial companies—are more sensitive
                    to interest rates than other sectors.</p>

                    the risk that market conditions will be unfavorable when the investor needs
                    to invest the proceeds from a prior investment. For an interest-bearing
                    security, reinvestment risk is the risk that an investor will receive lower
                    interest income after reinvesting the proceeds from an interest-bearing
                    security that has matured. Reinvestment risk also applies to any interest
                    payments that an investor receives while holding an interest-bearing security.</p>

                class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-419">Reinvestment risk increases in a declining interest-rate environment.
                    Insurance companies—and other institutional investors that hold many fixed-income
                    investments—can miss out on investment income as it becomes harder to find
                    bonds of a certain credit quality with coupon rates and yields as high
                    as those for their recently matured bonds. In such a scenario, investors
                    have two choices: (1) increase bond principal amounts to make up for lost
                    income or (2) pursue riskier bonds with higher coupon rates.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-420">Bonds have different levels of sensitivity to interest-rate changes, depending
                        on each bond’s coupon rate and term to maturity. Typically, two characteristics
                        associated with greater interest-rate sensitivity are lower coupon rates
                        and longer terms to maturity. In general, bonds with lower coupon rates
                        take longer to generate cash flows that cover the original cost of purchase
                        than bonds with higher coupon rates. Likewise, cash flows from bonds with
                        longer terms to maturity generally take more time to cover the investor’s
                        original cost than those of bonds with shorter terms to maturity. Bonds
                        with greater interest-rate sensitivity also experience greater market value
                        volatility.</p>

                        interest-bearing security. Duration can be defined as the responsiveness—expressed
                        in years—of a security’s market value to changes in market interest rates.
                        Investors can calculate duration in multiple ways, with different calculations

                                by approximately <em>n</em>% in the opposite direction. Thus, as the value
                                of duration increases, interest-rate risk increases.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma357-ch4-p-453">In a period of increasing market interest rates, insurance companies can
                        experience margin compression. <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-margincompression"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch4-span-91" role="doc-glossref">Margin compression</span> refers
                        to the narrowing of an insurer’s interest margin, potentially because of
                        market interest-rate changes. The <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-interestmargin"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma357-ch4-span-92" role="doc-glossref">interest margin</span>,
                        also known as the <em>interest-rate margin</em> or the <em>interest spread</em>,
                        is the share of investment earnings that an insurer retains after crediting
                        a share of investment earnings to policyowners.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-454">Typically, when market interest rates are rising, policyowners immediately
                        demand a higher crediting rate on their accounts. The company’s interest-bearing
                        investments, however, continue to earn the older, lower rates that prevailed
                        when the company purchased them. If the company immediately pays the new
                        higher rate on its products, the company’s interest margin will narrow.
                        If the company does not pay the new higher rate on its products, the company
                        will likely lose customers and business from financial professionals. To
                        minimize the risk of margin compression, insurance companies typically
                        try to issue products that limit customer withdrawal rights during a policy’s
                        early years. Watch Video 4.2 for a demonstration of how an insurer’s interest
                        margin can narrow as market interest rates increase.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma357-ch4-p-457">Margin compression also comes into play during periods of decreasing market
                        interest rates if asset maturities are not properly aligned with the average
                        life of the liabilities. The effects of margin compression due to falling
                        market interest rates are realized slowly over time, as the insurer collects
