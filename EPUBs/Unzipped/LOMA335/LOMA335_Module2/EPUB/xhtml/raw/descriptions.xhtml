                    <p>The steps for usability testing and customer surveys are to design customer
                        surveys, conduct usability testing and debrief, and analyze tests and surveys.
                        When conducting usability testing and debrief, employees will form user
                        group, establish testing location, and schedule tests. When analyzing tests
                        and surveys, employees will perform statistical analysis, discuss results,
                        and determine a plan of action.</p>
                    <p>The steps for developing a training initiative are to train customer service
                        team and train development team.</p>
                    <p>The steps for redesigning the self-service portal are to design interface
                        and prototype, install systems, and launch systems. When prototyping, employees
                        will present the prototype to sponsor and iterate. When installing systems,
                        employees will test systems and incorporate customer survey. When launching
                        systems, employees will launch system support.</p>

                    <p>A sample customer persona labeled “Persona Profile.”</p>
                    <p>An image of a person and his name and age is shown in the top left corner
                        (Matthew, 40).</p>
                    <p>Boxes on the page describe information that might be included in a customer
                        persona, as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact information: Accurate contact information enables easy identification
                            and communication with customers.</li>
                        <li>Characteristics: These characteristics often relate to a customer’s financial
                            needs: Demographic (age, gender, nationality), psychographic (personality,
                            lifestyle), and household (marital status, number and ages of children).</li>
                        <li>Behaviors: A customers’ behavior patterns can help insurers identify service
                            strategies that have succeeded in the past and are likely to succeed in
                            the future.</li>
                        <li>Level of satisfaction: A customer’s current satisfaction level with a
                            company and its services is an important predictor of future behavior and
                            can help a company determine how to maintain or improve satisfaction levels.</li>
                        <li>Interactions: A customer’s past company interactions—sales transactions,
                            calls, visits to website, or complaints—can inform the company about the
                            customer’s expectations and perceptions.</li>
                        <li>Risk tolerance: A customer’s willingness or ability to accept risk can
                            help a company determine the customer’s product or service needs.</li>
                        <li>Purchase: A customer’s previous purchases can help a company identify
                            additional customer purchase needs.</li>
