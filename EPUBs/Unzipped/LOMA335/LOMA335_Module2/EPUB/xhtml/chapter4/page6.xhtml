                        <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch4-p-315">AI can also make better use of data by analyzing the same data in different
                            ways across business units. From customer experience management system
                            data, an analyst can draw conclusions about both contact center initiatives
                            and the company’s IT capabilities. Advanced AI can figure out <em>and</em> carry
                            out both of these uses at once, allowing insurers more time for value-adding
                            activities. The following insight summarizes some of the growing uses of
                            AI in the insurance industry.</p>
