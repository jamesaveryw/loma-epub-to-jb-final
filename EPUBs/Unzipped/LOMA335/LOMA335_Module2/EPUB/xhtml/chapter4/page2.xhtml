            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch4-p-14">In Module 1, you learned how insurance companies strategize to achieve
                goals and deliver value to customers. In effect, companies deliver value
                through sets of processes designed to achieve corporate goals. Business
                process excellence requires management to understand how current processes
                work and how they affect customers. Consider how the business process described
                in this example affects this insurance customer:</p>
            <div class="example" id="loma335-ch4-div-18d">
                <p class="example-header" id="loma335-ch4-p-34d">EXAMPLE</p>
                <div class="inner" id="loma335-ch4-div-19d">
                    <div>
                        <p class="fig-inset" id="loma335-ch4-p-18">Maya, a new EndiFirst customer, logged into EndiFirst’s self-service portal
                            to make a premium payment. After entering her payment information, Maya
                            clicked “confirm” and received a message that the system was currently
                            unavailable. The message instructed her to call customer service to complete
                            her payment.</p>
                        <p class="fig-inset" id="loma335-ch4-p-19">When she called customer service, she was prompted to press 1 for questions
                            about an existing policy, 2 to make a payment, 3 to check on the status
                            of an application, or 4 for other questions. Maya selected 2. After waiting
                            several minutes, she was directed to a representative. The representative,
                            who misunderstood Maya’s desire to “complete her payment” as a request
                            to “make a payment,” gathered her information and processed the payment.</p>
                        <p
                        class="fig-inset" id="loma335-ch4-p-20">Later, Maya received two separate emails confirming pending payments that
                            would post within four to five business days. She went online to try to
                            cancel the duplicate pending payment, and the system instructed her to
                            call customer service to cancel the payment.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch4-p-21">Maya thought going online would be more convenient. Instead, the process
                was time-consuming and frustrating. Companies can avoid occurrences like
                Maya’s by continuously monitoring business processes to ensure they work
                well.</p>
