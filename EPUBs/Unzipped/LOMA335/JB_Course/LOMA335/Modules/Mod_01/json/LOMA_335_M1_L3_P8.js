Danny knew this was not the first time Mark had cornered Martha in such a way because she had mentioned to Danny that Mark’s behavior made her uncomfortable. As the only female on their work team, Martha wanted to be treated like one of the guys, but she felt uneasy sometimes with Mark’s choice of topics. Danny quickly picked up an envelope on his desk and wrote their manager’s name on the envelope. “Hey, Martha,” Danny said. “I’m expecting a call. You mind running this over to Doug’s office for me?” Martha smiled thankfully at Danny as she took the envelope and left. Once she was gone, Danny said casually to Mark. “Hey, did you notice Martha seemed uncomfortable? Maybe the workplace isn’t the best place to talk about such personal stuff.” Mark seemed genuinely surprised and nodded in agreement."
