For this reason, insurance operations utilize a variety of groups to accomplish work objectives. For example, an insurer might form a task force or an ad hoc committee on a temporary basis to solve an identified problem. Alternatively, in an effort to become more customer-centric or decrease a product’s time-to-market, an insurer might create an ongoing, cross-functional, self-directed work team that has the authority to make decisions and perform certain activities. As a result, understanding how groups and teams function in the workplace and how to motivate work group behavior is important."
