Even then, Model S projects may take a long time to complete or may never be completed without employees devoting personal time to the project. Model S works best within a culture of innovation where employees are encouraged to pursue innovation on their own initiative."

All innovation projects that do not fit Model S or Model R should be accomplished one unique initiative at a time with a dedicated innovation team. Creating and maintaining a specialized team of existing staff members makes sense for innovation initiatives that are likely to be repeated in the future and when the required expertise exists within the company. However, innovation requiring specialized expertise is often best conducted outside of normal business operations. Innovation expert Trimble warns, “Companies often overlook Model C, instead imagining that any innovation initiative can be tackled using the more familiar models, R and S. The main challenge of Model C is that it requires a dedicated team.”"
