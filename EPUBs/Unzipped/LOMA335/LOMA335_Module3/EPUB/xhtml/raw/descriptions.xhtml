                        narrow at the bottom to broad at the top. The x-axis of the matrix identifies
                        the level of familiarity with the decision as being unfamiliar and infrequent

                        These decisions have broad scope and impact but are familiar and frequent.
                        The bottom, left-hand section of the matrix is “Ad hoc decisions.” These

                    <p>What?</p>
                    <p>The mean is the numerical average of a series of values.</p>
                    <p>The median is the middle value in a set of values arranged in numerical
                        order.</p>
                    <p>The mode is the value that appears most often in a population.</p>
                    <p>How?</p>
                    <p>To find the mean, (1) find total of values, and (2) divide total of values
                        by the number of values</p>
                    <p>To find the median, (1) arrange values in numerical order, (2) count the
                        number of values, (3) if odd, find the middle value. If even, average two
                        middle values.</p>
                    <p>To find the mode, find the value or values that appear the most.</p>
                    <p>Drawbacks?</p>
                    <p>The mean doesn’t represent outliers well.</p>
                    <p>The median ignores all other values.</p>

                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>What?</p>
                    <p>The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a
                        particular population.</p>
                    <p>The variance is the average squared distance between the population mean
                        and each individual item in the population.</p>
                    <p>The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.</p>
                    <p>How?</p>
                    <p>To find the range, (1) identify lowest and highest values, and (2) subtract
                        lowest value from highest value.</p>
                    <p>To find the variance, (1) calculate the mean, (2) find the distance between
                        each item of data and the mean, (3) square each distance, (4) add squared
                        values, and (5) divide total by the number of items in the population.</p>
                    <p>To find the standard deviation, find the square root of the variance.</p>
                    <p>Drawbacks?</p>
                    <p>The range ignores middle values and doesn’t indicate patterns in the data.</p>
                    <p>The variance is not on the same numerical scale as raw data, so doesn’t
                        provide information about actual distance between data items.</p>
                    <p>The standard deviation assumes values are distributed normally.</p>

                        the data value from the most recent period as the forecast value for the
                        next period.</p>
                    <p>Arithmetic average model. This model uses the average value of all periods
                        as the forecast value for the next period.</p>
                    <p>Simple-moving average model. This model uses the average value of a specified
                        number of previous periods as the forecast value for the next period.</p>
                    <p>Weighted moving average time-series model. This model assigns relative
                        weights to the values of previous periods based on recentness. It uses
                        the average of weighted values as the forecast value for the next period.</p>

                    <p>Innovation has many definitions and we’ve made a major distinction over
                        the last couple of years in the lessons that we’ve learned in doing innovation
                        and being out on the forefront of it as an emerging discipline. There is
                        “big I” innovation and “small I” innovation and that distinction is important
                        when leaders are looking at and talking about embedding innovation in their
                        organizations. “Big I” innovation is about the future, new to the world,
                        giant leaps forward, high risk, and requires obviously a certain skills
                        set to get to that. Now that same skill set can be applied to “small I”
                        innovation as a proving ground or permission slip to do some bigger things.
                        So “small I” innovation is taking those same skills sets and tools and
                        applying them to everyday challenges—the challenges that people already
                        sort of understand or they know how to measure. So, once they can get those
                        sort of quick wins under their belt, it gives them the confidence to be
                        able to take on some bigger things.</p>
