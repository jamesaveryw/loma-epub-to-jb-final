            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch7-p-73">The goal of any decision, whether an ad hoc or a big-bet decision, is
                to select a course of action that results in a desirable outcome. Many
                everyday decisions do not require a formal decision-making process to arrive
                at a desirable outcome. Instead, people use <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-heuristics"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma335-ch7-span-19" role="doc-glossref">heuristics—</span>general
                rules appropriate for certain situations. For example, not all snakes are
                harmful to people, but most people need additional information to distinguish
                between poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes. Since people rarely have the
                time to stop and do research when they encounter a snake, avoiding all
                snakes is a good heuristic for most people. As illustrated in this example, <em>not</em> following
                the heuristic often carries greater risk than following it.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma335-ch7-p-74">Heuristics are sometimes appropriate and useful in business operations,
                in particular for ad hoc decisions that are low risk and low occurrence.
                Knowing that a similar situation was encountered previously and handled
                successfully allows people to use the same process in future situations
                without wasting time going through a formal decision process. However,
                just because something was handled in a particular way before is not a
                good reason to continue using the same method indefinitely. Occasionally,
                challenging such decisions is good management practice.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma335-ch7-p-75">Although no standard approach for making decisions exists, we can identify
                some general steps. Figure 7.3 outlines the basic steps of the decision-making

            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-77">One of the most difficult aspects of decision making is identifying the
                problem or need. During this first step, decision makers create and refine
                a statement of the issues to be resolved during further investigation.
                Essential to this task is asking the right questions so that the decision
                maker has relevant information. Figure 7.4 offers some examples of business
                questions that often initiate the decision-making process.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-79">Good business questions relate to the <em>five Ws</em> (who, what, when,
                where, and why) and also answer the question “how.” Questions like these
                call for answers that are <em>empirical</em>, meaning verifiable or evidence-based.
                A strong business question provides direction for a specific plan of action.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-80">For example, assume that a claim manager has received survey results indicating
                that customer satisfaction with the claims process has declined since the
                last survey. What are the relevant questions for the claims manager to
                ask? The most obvious question is, “Why are customers dissatisfied?” The
                claims manager needs data to answer this question. Assume that she looks
                at call data indicating that hold times have been above benchmark levels
                for several consecutive weeks. With this information, the claims manager
                assumes that long wait times for the previous month have increased customer
                dissatisfaction levels. The claims manager also notes that call volume
                per representative has been greater than average during this period. In
                this situation, the claims manager might decide that hiring more representatives
                will improve customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-81">However, good decision makers explore all relevant aspects of a situation
                    before making a decision. What if several representatives were sick and
                    working inefficiently during this period, or perhaps the claim verification
                    process now takes longer for each representative to complete because of
                    increased fraudulent claim activity? Exploring all aspects of a situation
                    is essential to good decision making.</p>

                <h3 id="loma335-ch7-h3-5">Framing the Decision Correctly</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch7-p-82">The first step of the decision-making process is often subject to <em>framing errors. </em>Franck
                    Schuurmans, noted expert on decision making, states that people may identify
                    and define a problem too narrowly because they assume they know what the
                    issue is.<span class="ens" id="loma335-ch7-span-24"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma335-ch7-en2" epub:type="noteref" id="loma335-ch7-span-25" role="doc-noteref">2</span> </span>

                    class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-decisionalternatives" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma335-ch7-span-26" role="doc-glossref">Decision alternatives</span>are the options a decision maker considers
                        before selecting a future course of action. In some cases, this step requires
                        substantial information gathering. In other situations, the decision alternatives
                        are more obvious because the problem or need has occurred previously.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-83">However, relying on what has happened in the past to determine relevant
                    decision alternatives may lead to poor results. For example, referring
                    back to our claims example, if customer dissatisfaction was caused by long
                    call wait times previously, the claims manager naturally assumes that long
                    wait times are the cause of the current dissatisfaction. However, if customer
                    dissatisfaction is the result of customers wanting their claims paid faster,
                    hiring more representatives to answer calls will not lessen customer dissatisfaction.
                    Schuurmans suggests gathering input from a diverse team within the company
                    to make sure that all relevant factors are more likely to be considered
                    before identifying a problem.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-84">Schuurmans also cautions against biases in decision framing. <span class="gt"
                        data-term="ch7-gt-confirmationbias" epub:type="glossref" id="loma335-ch7-span-27"
                        role="doc-glossref">Confirmation bias </span>is the human tendency to seek,
                        interpret, and remember information that confirms preexisting beliefs.
                        Confirmation bias provides support for all of the other types of cognitive
                        bias described in this text. For example, a manager who is subject to <em>negativity bias</em> when
                        doing a performance evaluation already has a poor opinion of the employee
                        and focuses on information that confirms that opinion. Continuing with
                        our previous example, because the claims manager thinks long call wait
                        times are the cause of customer dissatisfaction, she immediately reviews
                        the call data and, seeing that it is higher than usual, finds confirmation
                        for her assumptions. Decision makers who understand their susceptibility
                        to confirmation bias can take steps to avoid it.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch7-p-85">Small ad hoc and delegated decisions typically require little information
                        gathering, but cross-functional and big-bet decisions require substantial
                        research and information gathering. <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-data"

                        to unprocessed facts. Without some context, data is meaningless. For example,
                        if a call center receives 80 customer calls in one day, it is a <em>fact</em> that
                        the call center has had 80 callers. But what does that mean? No one knows
                        without additional context. If the decision maker knows that the call center
                        typically receives 50 calls a day, the fact that a day’s call volume was
                        80 calls becomes information the decision maker can use for staffing or
                        operations decisions. <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-information" epub:type="glossref"

                    <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-86">The quality of a decision is based, in part, on acquiring the right data
                        and converting the data into relevant information. Decision makers may <em>think </em>that
                        two or more business conditions are related, or that some factor is driving
                        a certain behavior, but to make good decisions they need information proving
                        such relationships. Chapters 8 and 9 describe ways to acquire and use the

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch7-p-92">During the framing and evaluation stages of the decision-making process,
                        obtaining diverse viewpoints can help avoid confirmation bias. Such information
                        may be presented either cooperatively or competitively by members of the
                        decision-making group. Social psychologist Morton Deutsch states that cooperative
                        group styles have <em>positively interdependent goals</em>, which means
                        that a group’s goals are clearly tied together so that the chance of any
                        one faction within the group attaining its goal is increased by the probability
                        of other factions within the group also attaining their goals. <em>Negatively interdependent goals</em> lead
                        to competition among the group members. In such situations, contested issues
                        turn into a power struggle, with each side seeking to “win” and have the
                        group accept its view as the right view. Figure 7.5 provides a comparison
                        of group characteristics that will lead to either cooperative or competitive

                        in opinions and fosters trust that will allow for dissenting opinions.
                        Sometimes groups take specific steps to incorporate a diversity of opinions
                        into the decision-making process. When making big-bet decisions, dissenting
                        opinions are crucial because of the high costs of making a bad decision.
                        As a result, big-bet decisions often include a formal position known as
                        a devil’s advocate. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-devilsadvocate"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma335-ch7-span-35" role="doc-glossref">devil’s advocate</span> is
                        a person assigned to make a case <em>against</em> a decision-making team’s
                        proposal. The devil’s advocate should operate independently of the group
                        and have no personal stake in the ultimate outcome of the group’s decision.
                        Members of the decision-making team should understand that the role of
                        the devil’s advocate is to make them focus on negative information and
                        to help them develop and present the strongest possible case for proceeding
                        with a particular decision. Another approach for gathering dissenting opinions
                        is to require that a decision-making team prepare a minority report that
                        presents contrarian opinions and facts.</p>

                                heads argued against the new project believing that the money would be
                                better spent on current products and operations. The innovation team argued
                                that the new project was necessary for the company’s future profitability.</p>

                                risk-return tradeoffs of the new project. The decision-making group reviewed
                                the innovation project team’s report and the devil’s advocate report before

                            maker is unable to assign individual probabilities because one or more

                                    responsibilities in the sale of insurance and financial products. The new
                                    rule will either be implemented as proposed, revised and implemented, or
                                    rejected and not implemented. Insurance companies know that one of these

                                    has not been fully implemented in any other insurance company. The benefits
                                    and risks are not fully known, but just as in Level 2 decisions, decision
                                    makers must identify a set of scenarios. Decision makers identify extreme

                                    is difficult and requires that decision makers focus on broad risk strategies
                                    for the range of probabilities.</p>

                            information as it becomes available. Potential outcomes tend to become
                            clearer after further analysis, and at some point in the future, the uncertainty
                            may move to a more manageable Level 3 or Level 2.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch7-p-124">After implementation, decision makers assess the decision outcomes in
                            comparison to expected outcomes. Decision expert Schuurmans notes that
                            feedback about the process itself is an often overlooked part of the decision-making
                            process. If a decision accomplishes what it was intended to accomplish,
                            the decision-making process is seen as successful without considering what
                            role luck might have played in the outcome. He suggests looking at the
                            decision process separately from the decision’s outcome to determine if
                            anything should have been done differently. Evaluating decisions without
                            assessing blame allows for learning from mistakes and makes for better
                            future decisions.<span class="ens" id="loma335-ch7-span-42"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma335-ch7-en5" epub:type="noteref" id="loma335-ch7-span-43" role="doc-noteref">5</span> </span>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch7-p-125">Schuurmans suggests that a big decision is actually a series of smaller
                            decisions that lead to the big decision. Keeping a decision log that lists
                            the names of all who have participated in the decision-making process and
                            their views and comments throughout the process is helpful in evaluating
                            a decision. For example, a decision log would include</p>
