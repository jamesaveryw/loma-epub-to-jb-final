            <p id="loma335-ch9-p-299">After analyzing the data and identifying decision alternatives, it is
                up to the decision makers to apply the data and select a plan of action
                that will yield the greatest return on investment.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch9-p-301">After analyzing relevant customer service, claims, and expense data with
                        other stakeholders, Satish decides that hiring two additional claims analysts
                        would improve the quality of communications with customers without burdening
                        company resources, ultimately yielding the greatest return on investment.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch9-p-303">We described <em>enterprise risk management (ERM)</em> in Chapter 1. Remember
                its definition: a system that identifies and quantifies risks from both
                potential threats and potential opportunities, and manages risks in a coordinated
                approach that supports an organization’s strategic objectives. Effective
                ERM relies on the appropriate selection of decision alternatives.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma335-ch9-p-304">In today’s volatile decision environment, the need for ERM is especially
                great. Using ERM, decision makers analyze and model possibilities in order
                to make decisions that help their companies avoid loss and seize opportunity.
                However, the avoidance of loss and the pursuit of opportunity involve opportunity
                costs. Recall that<em> opportunity costs </em>are benefits that a decision
                maker forfeits or gives up in choosing one alternative over another. Whenever
                a manager makes a decision, the business gives up a resource in exchange.
                These resources can include things like time, money, and publicity. Opportunity
                costs are unavoidable, but decision makers can minimize them using data.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma335-ch9-p-305">It’s important to note that the analysis of data is not fail-safe. All
                    decisions are subject to the uncertainties caused by noncontrollable conditions
                    such as globalization, consumer expectations, regulations, technology,
                    and an increasingly diverse workforce. As a result, decision makers revisit
                    conditions after implementation. They also make adjustments in line with
                    new information and opportunities. In the majority of cases, decision making
                    is best combined with innovative thinking.</p>
