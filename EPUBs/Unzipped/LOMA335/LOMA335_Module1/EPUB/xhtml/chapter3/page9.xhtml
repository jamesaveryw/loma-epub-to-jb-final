            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-279">An organization’s stated core values form the foundation for everything
                that takes place in the workplace. When an organization’s values are not
                aligned with reward systems and explicit work behaviors, employee morale
                and productivity suffer. In extreme situations, companies may also be subject
                to financial or legal risk.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-288">The Hankerville Manufacturing Company states that integrity is a core
                        organizational value. However, Melvin Thompson, who works in customer service,
                        is encouraged by his supervisor to handle customer problems with evasive
                        excuses rather than honesty and transparency. Mr. Thompson feels uncomfortable
                        engaging in these behaviors and views the Hankerville Company as hypocritical
                        for promoting integrity with words but not actions. Mr. Thompson is currently
                        looking for another job.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-282">To ensure alignment, companies must proactively identify a company’s core
                values, create and share meanings for those values with employees, and
                implement policies that support those core values. Ongoing monitoring of
                operations to ensure they align with values is also critical.</p>

                for the work she does. A highly engaged employee goes above and beyond
                what a job requires on a regular basis. Organizations with higher-than-average
                levels of employee engagement have higher levels of customer satisfaction,
                are more productive, have higher profits, and experience lower turnover
                than do companies with less engaged employees.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-284">Research shows that employees are more engaged in their jobs when their
                own values align with organizational values. For example, a person who
                is intellectually curious and who values continual learning is highly engaged
                when his company sets a high priority on employee development with continual
                learning and development opportunities.</p>

                    the company truly believes its employees are its most valuable resource,

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-304">Danny Channing overheard a male coworker telling a female coworker about
                            his date the night before. Danny knew this was not the first time Mark
                            had cornered Martha in such a way because she had mentioned to Danny that
                            Mark’s behavior made her uncomfortable. As the only female on their work
                            team, Martha wanted to be treated like one of the guys, but she felt uneasy
                            sometimes with Mark’s choice of topics. Danny quickly picked up an envelope
                            on his desk and wrote their manager’s name on the envelope. “Hey, Martha,”
                            Danny said. “I’m expecting a call. You mind running this over to Doug’s
                            office for me?” Martha smiled thankfully at Danny as she took the envelope
                            and left. Once she was gone, Danny said casually to Mark. “Hey, did you
                            notice Martha seemed uncomfortable? Maybe the workplace isn’t the best
                            place to talk about such personal stuff.” Mark seemed genuinely surprised
                            and nodded in agreement.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-305">Bystanders should try to diffuse an uncomfortable situation without drawing
                    direct attention to themselves. In our example, Danny got Martha away from
                    an uncomfortable situation without Mark realizing what Danny was doing.
                    Interrupting a conversation with a question for the offender or creating
                    an excuse for the victim to leave are ways to diffuse such situations.
                    Bystanders should never confront an offender openly if it would put the
                    bystander at risk. In our example, Danny and Mark worked closely together
                    on a team, so Danny felt comfortable talking with Mark about his behavior
                    in a nonthreatening way.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-306">In situations where a bystander suspects something might have happened
                    but is uncertain, the bystander can talk to the victim privately. For example,
                    assume that Martha had not told Danny about Mark’s behavior but Danny suspected
                    Martha was uncomfortable. In such a situation, he could say to Martha,
                    “I notice Mark keeps talking to you about personal stuff. Are you okay
                    with that?” Often victims are uncertain if they are overreacting to a situation.
                    Having a bystander affirm that the situation is questionable may be all
                    the victim needs to speak up to a supervisor about offensive actions.</p>

                    in how to give and receive constructive criticism or how to listen to others
