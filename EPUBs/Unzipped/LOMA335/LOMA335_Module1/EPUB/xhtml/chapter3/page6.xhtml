            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-160">Performance evaluation is identified as a control tool in Chapter 2 because
                it helps operations management ensure that employee performance aligns
                with goals and strategies. In a typical performance evaluation process,
                employee goals are set at the beginning of the appraisal period—a type
                of steering control. During the evaluation period, the evaluator and employee
                meet to review progress toward these goals—a type of concurrent control.
                Then, at the end of the year, the evaluator conducts a formal appraisal—a
                type of feedback control. Performance evaluation is necessary for management
                to make decisions about compensation, promotions, transfers, and terminations.</p>

                        if the employee needs any assistance in order to meet the goals. With the
                        rapid pace of change in business today, goals themselves may also change
                        during the evaluation period. At the end of the evaluation period, typically
                        annually, the employee and supervisor evaluate the employee’s overall success
                        in meeting established goals and set goals for the next evaluation period.</p>

                    class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-174">For MBO to be effective, goals must be specific and measurable so that
                        employees know what they must do. A well-managed MBO program also provides
                        employees with objective, results-oriented feedback that can aid employee
                        development. A problem with MBO is that an effective MBO program is time-consuming
                        for the supervisor to manage.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-175">How frequently an employee receives performance feedback during the evaluation
                            period depends on the employee. For example, new employees may benefit
                            from daily or weekly feedback, whereas more experienced employees may only
                            need monthly or even less frequent feedback. Regardless of the frequency,
                            regular interactions between a supervisor and employee promote communication,
                            build trust, and provide a supervisor with an opportunity to provide ongoing
                            positive reinforcement. In general, an employee should not hear positive
                            or negative performance-related information for the first time at an annual
                            performance review.</p>

                            of their job, or who want to develop new skills, a supervisor may use coaching.

                            role="doc-glossref">Coaching</span>is a process in which a supervisor works with an employee
                                to improve performance on the job. Coaching is typically short-term, focusing
                                on new job skills or on improving competency in a job skill. Once that
                                skill is learned, the coaching ends. When effective, coaching motivates
                                employees to improve performance in a current job.</p>

                            role="doc-glossref">Mentoring </span>is a process for developing employee
                            talent over the long term. For example, a more experienced individual—the <em>mentor—</em>serves
                            as a teacher for an employee in a current job and develops the employee
                            for future jobs. Mentoring relationships can be formal or informal. <em>Formal mentoring</em>  <strong> </strong>is
                            a mentoring arrangement officially endorsed by the organization. <em>Informal mentoring</em>  <strong> </strong>refers
                            to a mentoring arrangement that develops outside of official channels.
                            For example, a senior employee may begin informally mentoring a new employee
                            on his own. Informal arrangements tend to be more effective than formal
                            ones. In an effective mentoring relationship, the employee feels free to
                            openly discuss job challenges and future plans in a nonthreatening environment.
                            As you might expect, the mentor is usually not the employee’s immediate
                            supervisor. When effective, mentoring helps an employee’s career advancement
                            and increases the employee’s commitment to the organization.</p>

                            employee performance and about what motivates employees to work harder
                            vary widely. <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-cognitivebias" epub:type="glossref"
                            id="loma335-ch3-span-68" role="doc-glossref">Cognitive bias</span> is a
                            general term used to describe biases in the human mind that are difficult
                            to eliminate and that lead to inaccurate judgments. One challenge in combating
                            cognitive biases is that most people are not aware of them or their susceptibility
                            to them. People who learn about common cognitive biases can take measures
                            to ensure that they are less likely to succumb to one or more of them.
                            Important biases in performance evaluation include recency error, similarity
                            error, hiring-manager bias, the halo effect, and negativity bias.</p>

                                    in the past. When performance evaluations are conducted annually and employees
                                    do not receive ongoing performance feedback, recency error can be significant.</p>

                                    work. For example, a manager might remember that an employee is frequently

                                    id="loma335-ch3-span-70" role="doc-glossref">Compensation </span>is the
                                    total monetary amount of benefits provided by an employer to an employee
                                    in return for work performed as required. Compensation includes an employee’s
                                    pay as well as the value of vacations, bonuses, insurance, and any other
                                    employer-provided benefit, such as free parking or lunches. A compensation
                                    package of pay and benefits is necessary to attract and retain the most
                                    qualified and talented employees and to maintain or increase the level
                                    of employee performance. To develop an attractive compensation package,
                                    insurance companies first determine what other insurers and companies in
                                    other industries are providing to their employees. Economic conditions
                                    also greatly affect the rewards a company can offer. For example, a company
                                    is more likely to offer a more generous total compensation package in a
                                    prosperous economy.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-191">Because every employee is different, and expectancy theory suggests that
                                    rewards must be important to an employee to be motivating, companies typically
                                    offer employees options in compensation plans. Employee needs will vary
                                    based on age, marital status, a spouse’s benefit status, and the number
                                    and age of dependents. Figure 3.3 shows the top five overall benefit priorities
                                    from an employer and employee perspective.</p>

                                    priorities, the importance of other benefit offerings is less clear. A <em>flexible benefits plan</em>  <strong> </strong>is
                                    a benefit plan that allows each employee to select the benefits package
                                    that best satisfies current needs. For example, a company may provide a
                                    set of core benefits such as health insurance, life insurance, and vacation
                                    while allowing employees to choose from among other benefits, such as paid
                                    parental leave or disability insurance. Figure 3.4 illustrates what percentage
                                    of different age groups rank paid parental leave or disability insurance
                                    as a top-five benefit.</p>

                                    a performance evaluation and compensation program is extensive. Developing
                                    performance measurements that tie employee performance to merit-based compensation
                                    is a lengthy process that requires determining skills and competencies
                                    for jobs across an organization. Furthermore, even the best-developed evaluation
                                    and compensation programs won’t be effective if managers are not trained

                                    studies of motivation suggest that the best way for employers to motivate
