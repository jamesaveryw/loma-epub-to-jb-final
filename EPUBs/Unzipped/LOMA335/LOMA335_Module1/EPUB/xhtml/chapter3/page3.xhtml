                the ability to influence the behavior of others by means other than the
                formal authority that an organization has conferred. For example, an informal
                leader may influence the behavior of others by being an inspiring role
                model for positive workplace behaviors. Managers may be both formal and
                informal leaders. Nonmanagers can act as informal leaders within a company
                and can be influential in creating the corporate culture. We focus in this
                text, though, primarily on formal leaders in management positions.</p>

                            Employees, however, do not like surprises about the organization or their
                            work, and would prefer to hear unpleasant news from a manager rather than

                            is only as good as the communication that exists between the two. Trustworthy

                            to employees during rough times and celebrate with employees during good

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-46">Leaders have various types of power. Management literature recognizes
                    five bases of power in an organization: legitimate, reward, coercive, expert,
                    and referent.<span class="ens" id="loma335-ch3-span-14"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma335-ch3-en3" epub:type="noteref" id="loma335-ch3-span-15" role="doc-noteref">3</span> </span>The
                    first three types of power are formal powers associated with an individual’s
                    position within an organization. The last two types of power come from
                    qualities inherent in an individual and are types of personal power. Figure
                    3.1 describes these types of power.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-48">Legitimate power correlates to organizational position. For example, a
                    supervisor has legitimate power over direct reporting employees, and a
                    divisional manager has legitimate power over the supervisor. Thus, the
                    divisional manager has more legitimate power than does the supervisor because
                    of her position. Reward power typically flows from legitimate power in
                    that those with legitimate power can usually give pay raises, promotions,
                    and special recognition. Like reward power, coercive power is associated
                    with legitimate power in that a manager has the authority to institute
                    disciplinary actions when an employee’s performance is not adequate. Referent
                    power can result from a person’s own qualities that inspire loyalty and
                    respect, or from that person’s connections to another. For example, having
                    a close relationship with the company’s president might give a person referent
                    power. Expert power and referent power tend to be most effective within
                    a collaborative work environment. Referent power, however, takes time to
                    develop and so is not as useful when a company has high employee turnover.
                    The use of coercive power tends to result in decreased employee satisfaction
                    with the organization.</p>
