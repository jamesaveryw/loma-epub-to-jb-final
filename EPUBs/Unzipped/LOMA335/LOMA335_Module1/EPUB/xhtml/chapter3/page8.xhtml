            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-250">Effective work groups outperform individuals because they include a greater
                diversity of opinions, which typically results in higher-quality decisions.
                For this reason, insurance operations utilize a variety of groups to accomplish
                work objectives. For example, an insurer might form a task force or an
                ad hoc committee on a temporary basis to solve an identified problem. Alternatively,
                in an effort to become more customer-centric or decrease a product’s time-to-market,
                an insurer might create an ongoing, cross-functional, self-directed work
                team that has the authority to make decisions and perform certain activities.
                As a result, understanding how groups and teams function in the workplace
                and how to motivate work group behavior is important.</p>

                        to gather functional expertise or gain differing viewpoints. A group of
