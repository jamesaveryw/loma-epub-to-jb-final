            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-223">According to the job characteristics model, the presence or lack of these
                five core job dimensions can affect employee motivation in positive or
                negative ways. Research has shown that not all workers desire or are motivated
                by all five characteristics. The challenge for management is to match employees
                to jobs with suitable core job dimensions. Millennials, in general, tend
                to value autonomy more than older baby boomers. In addition, employees’
                needs for various core job dimensions change during a career. For example,
                a new employee who needs guidance is not motivated by high levels of autonomy
                when starting a job. Note also that these features are not necessarily
                objective. For example, our assembly-line worker found higher task significance
                in her job once she realized the importance of her work to the car’s safety.
                Thus, a manager might potentially increase the motivating aspects of routine
                jobs by tying a job’s importance to a larger objective or mission that
                might not be evident to the employee. For example, a claims representative
                might not understand the importance of reviewing beneficiary signatures
                with the signatures on claims until the manager explains how claim fraud
                negatively effects beneficiaries receiving their benefits promptly and
                the company’s financial performance.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-224">Employers often attempt to organize work activities so that they are more
                suitable to employees. Three common approaches to job design are job rotation,
                job enlargement, and job enrichment.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-225">One of the earliest approaches to job design was <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-jobrotation"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma335-ch3-span-86" role="doc-glossref">job rotation</span>—a
                process in which employees are periodically shifted from one task to another
                task with similar skill requirements. Job rotation is appropriate for routine
                tasks in which shifting employees relieves the monotony of doing one repetitive
                task or alleviates the stress of certain work-related duties.</p>

                        employees who handle these types of calls to other less stressful tasks

            </div>
            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-229">Job rotation allows a company to address unpredictable worker demand by
                shifting workers to areas where current demand is greatest. Job rotation
                is also an effective way for employees to acquire new skills, and companies
                sometimes use job rotation to train new employees. For example, management
                training programs frequently rotate management trainees through all areas
                of a company.</p>

                id="loma335-ch3-span-87" role="doc-glossref">Job enlargement </span>is
                the process of creating a new job by combining two or more specialized
                tasks to add more variety. The enlarged job requires that the employee
                be more knowledgeable about a broader set of tasks, and sometimes for the
                completion of a whole and identifiable piece of work. Thus, job enlargement
                has the potential to increase the skill and task dimensions of a job. For
                example, a new business representative may be given the authority to enter
                life insurance application information and review insurability of the applicant
                up to a certain amount limit.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-231"><span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-jobenrichment" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma335-ch3-span-88" role="doc-glossref">Job enrichment </span>is the
                process of redesigning a job to allow workers more control over how they
                perform their work tasks. When workers have greater authority and responsibility
                for the completion of their work, they often can eliminate unnecessary
                tasks and become more efficient and effective. For example, employees who
                are responsible for reaching out to the owners of lapsed policies may have
                their jobs enriched when they are given authority within specified guidelines
                to reinstate policies according to the policyowner’s needs for such things
                as a waiver of interest on overdue premiums or a waiver of medical tests.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-232">Companies sometimes use nontraditional work arrangements to satisfy employee
                    needs for autonomy by allowing employees to decide when and/or where they

                            role="doc-glossref">Flextime</span> is an approach in which employees must
                            work a certain number of hours per week but have discretion in deciding
                            when they will work. For example, employees may be required to work between
                            the core hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. each day but can decide when they
                            will work their other four hours. Some employees may want to start work
                            early, while others like working later into the night. Some companies allow
                            employees the flexibility of working a <em>compressed workweek </em>in which
                            an employee works 40 or more hours in fewer than five days. For example,
                            an employee could work four 10-hour days. Flextime is particularly attractive
                            to employees trying to balance childcare or eldercare responsibilities
                            with work, or who can shorten their commute time by coming to work earlier

                            approach in which employees work remotely, away from the office. High-speed
                            internet access and technological advances have made it possible for millions
                            of employees to work from home or a remote office, and experts estimate
                            the number of remote workers will increase in the coming years. Telecommuting
                            is particularly attractive to employees with long commutes and to younger
                            employees who value flexibility in how they work. Employers also can benefit
                            from lower overhead costs and improved morale and productivity. Dozens
                            of studies indicate that telecommuting can boost productivity, job performance,
                            and job satisfaction. A 2017 survey found that more than half of insurers,
                            across carrier types and size, reported positive realized benefits from
                            enabling employees to work remotely.<span class="ens" id="loma335-ch3-span-91"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma335-ch3-en11" epub:type="noteref" id="loma335-ch3-span-92" role="doc-noteref">11</span> </span>However,
