            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-61">Behavior modification<strong> </strong>refers to techniques used to encourage
                desirable behavior and discourage undesirable behavior. According to behavior
                modification theory, individuals can learn to become effective leaders
                by modifying their own behaviors. Effective leaders can also use techniques,
                such as influence tactics and rewards, to influence or modify the behaviors
                of others.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-62">Effective leaders develop certain tactics for influencing others to act
                in specified ways, and such leaders also recognize that certain tactics
                work better in some situations than others. Nine commonly used influence
                tactics are shown below.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-93">Overall, the most effective influence tactics tend to be rational persuasion
                and consultation. Pressure tactics are rarely appropriate in the workplace
                unless other methods of influencing an employee’s behavior have failed.
                For example, a manager may need to threaten termination of employment if
                other methods of influence have not changed an employee’s actions.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-94">Any of these tactics may influence others to accept or agree to what a
                leader wants in the short term. However, rational persuasion and consultation
                are the best tactics for motivating others and gaining acceptance or agreement
                over the long term.</p>

                        of an organization to be successful. Thus, all employees regardless of
                        their organizational level can benefit from developing effective leadership
                        practices. For example, an employee who does not host group meetings still
                        has meetings with other individuals. Taking control of time and running
                        productive meetings are important leadership skills.</p>

                        day has only 24 hours in it, and one cannot save yesterday’s time to use
                        today. Yet many people squander this irreplaceable resource, often unintentionally.
                        The only way to determine how time is being spent is to keep a log of real-time
                        activities. After keeping an accurate log for two to four weeks, most people
                        find that they actually spend a large amount of time doing nonproductive,
                        time-wasting activities. Once people identify these time-wasting activities,
                        they can determine whether the activity can be</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-102">Another valuable exercise is to look at all activities, not just the ones
                        identified as time-wasting activities, with an eye for efficiency. People
                        often do some activities or work tasks in the way they were taught without
                        ever questioning why. By reexamining the desired result, people often find
                        a more efficient way to achieve it.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma335-ch3-p-103">People who analyze their time usually find that they spend a lot of it
                        in meetings. Some meetings are necessary; many others are not. For example,
                        it may be more efficient to send out an email update than to gather everyone
                        for an update meeting. Effective leaders eliminate unnecessary meetings
                        that waste their own time and the time of others. Even necessary meetings
                        are time wasters when not run efficiently. Drucker suggests that productive
                        meetings have the following characteristics:</p>

                                determined before the meeting and end as soon as the purpose is accomplished.
                                An agenda should be created with set time frames for each topic. The leader
                                needs to keep the group on time and task. Meetings should not be general
                                chat sessions unless the stated purpose of the meeting is to explore opinions
                                and brainstorm.</p>

                                a meeting, attendees should receive a summary of the meeting. The summary
                                should include decisions made, who is responsible for what follow-up activities,
                                and relevant deadlines for assigned activities. Attendees can then notify
                                the leader if they need clarification. A summary of the meeting promotes
                                clear communication among meeting attendees and directs activities to the
                                completion of goals.</p>

                        techniques because a company can control many aspects of an employee’s
                        work environment. Behavior modification in the workplace generally seeks
                        to manage the antecedents or consequences of employee behaviors.</p>

                                <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-124">Negative reinforcement and punishment seem similar but they are not. In
                                    these examples, Tina’s manager used negative reinforcement when she realized
                                    that Tina’s unwillingness to do the presentation was due to her anxiety
                                    about standing in front of the group. By removing the unpleasant aspect
                                    of the situation that was causing Tina’s anxiety, Tina’s manager used negative
                                    reinforcement appropriately. People often use negative reinforcement inappropriately
                                    without realizing it. For example, an employee who finds a task boring
                                    may complain about the task to his manager until the manager reassigns
                                    the task to another employee. The complaining employee is then encouraged
                                    in the future to complain about other tasks he does not enjoy doing.</p>

                                class="txt" id="loma335-ch3-p-125">Punishment, on the other hand, requires applying something unpleasant
                                    to influence behavior. In Tina’s case, her punishment would have been no
                                    quarterly bonus if she did not do the presentation. Acting to avoid something
                                    negative typically results in less than optimal performance.</p>

                                    id="loma335-ch3-p-126">Of these strategies, positive reinforcement, such as praise and recognition,
                                        tends to be the most effective in ongoing behavior management. Studies
                                        show that praise and recognition from superiors are highly effective ways
                                        of boosting morale and productivity. In addition, the timing of behavioral
