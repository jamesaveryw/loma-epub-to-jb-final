                        When companies use AI, workers can focus their efforts more effectively
                        on less routine activities. Insurers also use AI to gain new insights into

                            New competitors are not held to this status quo because they have no past
                            experience. New market competitors may be able to establish a different

                            in the future. For example, LIMRA research shows that the Internet is close
                            to surpassing financial professionals as the most valuable source of information

                        <p class="txt" id="loma335-ch1-p-151">Successful companies often focus on Box 1 because their success comes
                            from optimizing what they are currently doing. Govindarajan cautions that
                            such companies need to manage their present business for profitability
                            but always be looking to the future. To ensure continued success, Govindarajan
                            recommends that companies let go of attitudes and assumptions that might
                            fuel current business but interfere with future innovation. Box 2 requires
                            companies to discontinue activities or even lines of business that might
                            be successful today but are unlikely to be successful in the future because
                            some aspect of the environment is changing. Box 2 requires difficult and
                            often painful decisions. Box 3 is where a company’s future lies. Focusing
                            the company’s attention on new ideas and innovations allows companies to
                            create new products and business models that take advantage of new or emerging
                            technologies. Box 3 represents how a company remains relevant in the future.</p>

                                            1946 until 1964) as the largest living population segment. Millennials,
                                            as a whole, have been slow to adopt many of the markers commonly associated

                                                    transparency. In response, some companies changed their operations and
