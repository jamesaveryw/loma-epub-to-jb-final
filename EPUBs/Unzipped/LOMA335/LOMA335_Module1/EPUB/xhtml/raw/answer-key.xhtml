                        interest rate or currency fluctuations. Operational risk is harder to quantify

                            environment. Strategic management must also consider the competitive environment
                            in which the company operates. All of a company’s strategic planning efforts
                            should support the corporate mission.</p>

                            sellers. A monopoly is a market in which one firm, or a group of firms
                            acting together, controls the production and distribution of a product.
                            Monopolistic competition is a market with many sellers, similar products
                            and services, a customer perception of non-price differences between products
                            and services, and reliance on advertising.</p>

                                    or admiration of others. Referent power can result from a person’s own
                                    qualities that inspire loyalty and respect, or from that person’s connections
                                    to another. For example, having a close relationship with the company’s
                                    president might give a person referent power. Mr.&#160;Davenport has coercive
                                    power, which results from a person’s ability to discipline others for poor

                                <p class="q-stem-static">Self-determination theory (SDT) is a motivation theory that describes
                                    the effects of intrinsic rewards and extrinsic rewards. SDT also classifies
                                    motivation as autonomous motivation or controlled motivation. According
                                    to SDT, autonomous motivation arises primarily from <strong>(intrinsic rewards</strong> / <strong>extrinsic rewards)</strong>.
                                    When autonomous motivation is involved, a person typically <strong>(is</strong> / <strong>is not)</strong> highly

                                    relatedness, and autonomy. Autonomous motivation arises primarily from
                                    intrinsic rewards affiliated with needs for competence, relatedness, and
                                    autonomy. When autonomous motivation is involved, a person is highly motivated
                                    to engage in an activity. Controlled motivation primarily involves extrinsic
                                    rewards.</p>

                                    When multiple ratings are combined, the overall results are much more likely

                                    the goals. At the end of the evaluation period, typically annually, the
                                    employee and supervisor evaluate the employee’s overall success in meeting
                                    established goals and set goals for the next evaluation period. A problem
                                    with MBO is that an effective MBO program is time-consuming for the supervisor

                                    task but an increased need for clarification about everything, such as
                                    who is responsible for what. The identified leaders must provide clarification
                                    and attempt to resolve any hidden disagreements and personality conflicts
                                    so that the group can move on to the next stage.</p>
