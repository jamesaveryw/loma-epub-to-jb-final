                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>1. Effective leaders ask, “What needs to be done?”</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[A man appears on screen.]</p>
                    <p>Man: Expanding internationally would really open new markets.</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[A woman appears on screen.]</p>
                    <p>Woman: We don’t have the resources.</p>
                    <p>Man: Let’s see what we can do to free up the resources.</p>
                    <p>2. Effective leaders ask, “What is right for the company?</p>
                    <p>Man: Personally, I’d like to expand internationally, but I guess it’s
                        best to shore up domestic operations first.</p>
                    <p>3. Effective leaders develop action plans based on top priorities.</p>
                    <p
                    class="vid-desc">[Man looks at a chart.]</p>
                        <p>Man: Hmmm. What should our first step be?</p>
                        <p>4. Effective leaders take responsibility for decisions</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[Man talking to a group.]</p>
                        <p>Man: Senior management has developed a plan for domestic operations. I
                            am 100% behind this plan.</p>
                        <p>5. Effective leaders communicate well with others.</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[Man talking to woman.]</p>
                        <p>Man: Let’s plan on talking first thing every morning to make sure all
                            of these changes stay on track.</p>
                        <p>6. Effective leaders focus on opportunities rather than problems.</p>
                        <p
                        class="vid-desc">[Woman talking to man.]</p>
                            <p>Woman: Mid-west operations still have some issues.</p>
                            <p>Man: But I’m so excited that the west coast is doing better than anticipated.</p>
                            <p>7. Effective leaders run productive meetings.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Man talking to woman.]</p>
                            <p>Man: Cancel the meeting. John can’t be there.</p>
                            <p>Woman: Right. It would be a waste of time without John.</p>
                            <p>8. Effective leaders think and say “we” rather than “I.”</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Man talking to a group.]</p>
                            <p>Man: We’ve come a long way since we started this initiative.</p>

                    <p>1. Effort: Will effort result in performance?</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[Woman appears on screen.]</p>
                    <p>Woman: Do I have the skills to do this job?</p>
                    <p>2. Performance: Will performance lead to outcome?</p>
                    <p>Woman: If I do this job, will I receive a bonus?</p>
                    <p>3. Reward: Is the outcome desirable?</p>
                    <p>Woman: Will the bonus pay for that trip I’ve been wanting to take?</p>
                    <p>Effort plus Performance plus Reward equals Motivation. Person is motivated
                        to perform.</p>

                    <p><strong>Ina Allison, Ph.D.<br />Director, Assessment and Development Solutions<br />LOMA</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>A 2017 survey found that more than half of insurers across carrier types
                        and size reported positive realized benefits from enabling employees to
                        work remotely. Remote workers face unique challenges in that they do not
                        have the same resources available to them as in-office employees. For example,
                        remote workers may be required to trouble shoot their own technology problems.
                        In addition, remote workers can find it difficult to form supportive relationships
                        with other employees, and to collaborate on work projects. For these reasons,
                        not every person is a good fit for remote work. Remote workers need good
                        organizational skills, good communication skills, technological knowledge,
                        and the ability to focus in the presence of distractions in order to work
                        successfully away from the office.</p>
                    <p>One of the most effective ways for employers to identify the people with
                        the needed skills, traits, and knowledge is to use validated assessment
                        tools in the hiring process. Assessment tests can help employers avoid
                        hiring people who would into be proficient at remote work because they
                        require a great deal of supervision or personal interaction. Assessment
                        tests are also a great start in determining the training needs of existing
                        remote workers to improve their productivity. Employers can incorporate
                        low assessment scores into an employee’s professional development plan.
                        And, it’s not just remote workers who need training and support. Managers
                        must know how to keep remote workers engaged, motivated, and accountable,
                        and they may need assistance in developing teleworking policies and procedures.</p>
                    <p>LOMA offers valid assessment tests including one that measures a person’s
                        ability to be successful in a virtual environment, focusing on the skills,
                        preferences, and attributes of people working remotely.</p>
