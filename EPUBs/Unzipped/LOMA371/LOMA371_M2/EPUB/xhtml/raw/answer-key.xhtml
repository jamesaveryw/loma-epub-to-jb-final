	<p class="q-stem-static">The most basic new product risk is that a new product never earns a profit at all. Potential causes of inadequate profits, or even losses, include</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Inadequate pricing</li>
		<li>Incorrect underwriting standards</li>
		<li>Poor sales volume</li>
		<li>A product design that quickly becomes obsolete</li>

		<li>A, B, and C only</li>
		<li>A and B only</li>
		<li>C and D only</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">When developing a new product, a company incurs costs that it must recover, while perhaps losing the opportunity to develop an alternative product or products that might have been more profitable. For new products, however, there is no history. Without relevant experience data, the actuarial staff must invest more time learning about the new product during product design.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Many risks comprise new product risk. To manage new product risk, insurers consider many factors, including the product development strategy, product portfolio and product mix, shelf life, product complexity, customer experience, product management and control, regulatory factors, and other environmental pressures.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 5A. Discuss the risks associated with launching new products.</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Life insurers carefully consider how to position their products for success by employing product development strategies early in the product development process. Select the answer choice that is an example of the product development strategy known as a focused differentiation, or niche strategy.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>The Cantata Life Insurance Company aims to be the first to offer new variable life insurance products, and the first to capture and retain the largest share of the market for those products.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />The Daybreak Life Insurance Company markets its life insurance product with a long-term-care insurance rider only to pre-retirees and early retirees.</li>
		<li>Edifice Insurers creates improved deferred annuity products before its competitors; product improvements appeal to a larger portion of potential customers than competing products.</li>
		<li>The Fanfare Insurance Company markets its basic term life insurance product during times of slow economic growth, when customers with tighter budgets carefully consider all costs.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Examples of product development strategies include cost leadership; focused differentiation, or niche strategy; first mover strategy; and fast follower strategy. Not all insurers have a clearly defined strategy for product development. For example, an insurer may offer several products designed with a cost leadership strategy, yet also develop a new product with a focused differentiation or niche strategy.</p>

	<p class="explanations">If the company has the resources and knowledge base to support multiple product development strategies, it can offer a more diverse range of products and therefore appeal to a broader market. This product diversification also aids solvency: when one product line is underperforming, the insurer may still have the revenues from other product lines to help meet its obligations.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 5B. Describe common product development strategies.</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Consider the descriptions of the product offerings of the following two companies:</p>

	<ul class="examul">
		<li>The Able Life Insurance Company collects 70% of its total premiums from term life insurance products, 18% from immediate annuity products, and 12% from variable deferred annuit &amp; bsp;products</li>
		<li>The Butte Life Insurance Company offers term life insurance, fixed deferred annuities, variable deferred annuities, and immediate annuities</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">With regard to the marketing concept known as the product mix, it is correct to say that a product mix is represented by the description of</p>

		<li>Butte’s product offerings only</li>
		<li>neither Able’s nor Butte’s product offerings</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The description of Able’s product offerings represents the company’s product mix, which is a company’s total assortment of products within each line of business according to a monetary measure of business volume, such as premiums collected, reserves—or, in the case of life insurance, face amount in force. An insurer typically measures its product mix by proportion.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The description of Butte’s product offerings represents the company’s product portfolio, which is the array of all products a company offers for sale, categorized by line of business. For example, an insurer might have a life insurance portfolio and an annuity portfolio.</p>

	<p class="explanations">When launching a new product, a company adds to its product portfolio and alters the proportions of its product mix. For example, a new annuity product would broaden the product portfolio, but would also alter the proportionate amount of reserves held for annuities as a whole.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the context of product development, shelf life refers to how long an insurer can offer a product in the marketplace before it becomes obsolete and needs to be revised, repriced, or retired. With regard to an industry survey on the shelf life of variable universal life insurance products, term life insurance products, and whole life insurance products, it is correct to say that</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">In the United States, most insurance and annuity products have a shelf life between one and five years. Generally, whole life insurance, life insurance products with riders, and fixed annuities tend to have longer shelf lives (nearly five years) than term life insurance products (less than two years).</p>

	<p class="explanations">According to an industry survey, whole life insurance products have a shelf life of 4.7 years, followed by variable universal life insurance at 3.4 years, and term life insurance at 1.5 years. Indexed products, such as indexed universal life insurance products and indexed annuity products, are the most prone to revision or retirement, with an average shelf life of about one to two years.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Companies can distinguish between product development projects based on their complexity. For example, a (<strong>rate change</strong> / <strong>new product</strong>) project is typically less complex than a product revision project. One example of a (<strong>rate</strong> <strong>change</strong> / <strong>product revision</strong>) project is the addition of a rider to an existin &amp; bsp;product.</p>

		<li>new product / rate change</li>
		<li>new product / product revision</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The more complex a product development project is, the more time the product takes to get to market. Rate change projects require planning, pricing, and possibly changing administration processes, pre-sales illustrations, and testing tools.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Product revision projects involve changes to an existing product that are more complex than rate change projects, and involve regulatory rate filings to reflect the changes. A new product project requires a full-scale effort in all phases of the product development process, including the development of new product features and the preparation of comprehensive regulatory filings.</p>

		<li>a market analysis strategy</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Customer experience (frequently abbreviated as CX) has become a vital part of doing business in all industries, including the life insurance industry. CX is the impression of a company that a customer forms as a result of every interaction the customer has with the company and its representatives. Customer expectations are so high that delivering an exceptional CX must be a priority for a life insurer.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To promote a stronger CX, insurers are developing more customizable products that allow customers to match their individual needs. Insurers can use the information collected from omnichannel services to assess customer risk profiles and to tailor new products and policies. This strategy seeks to provide a positive experience at each potential point of contact that a customer might have with the company.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. For example, older customers might favor researching services electronically but purchasing them in face-to-face transactions. As demographics shift, product development teams must consider what product features would have greater appeal for the growing sections of the market.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. For example, when inflation outpaces wage growth, consumer budgets become more limited, and fewer consumers see insurance as a priority.

	<p class="q-stem-static">When actuaries design a new life insurance or annuity product, they must estimate the cost of benefits. Generally, the projected cost of a single insurance benefit for a given policy year equals the</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>earnings from using investments in derivative securities to control volatility in the investment portfolio that supports the insurance product</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />potential benefit amount payment multiplied by the probability that the benefit will be payable</li>
		<li>amount by which the product will meet or exceed the insurer’s profit target for the product</li>
		<li>estimate of operating expenses—without allowances for future inflation—incurred in supporting the product</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The cost of benefits, sometimes known as the cost of insurance, is the value of the contractually required benefits that a product promises to pay. A single product may offer numerous benefits, and the projected cost of all benefits is the sum of the individual benefit costs. For life insurance products, the insurer’s benefit obligations for a given policy year are equal to the death benefit amount multiplied by the mortality rate plus any nonforfeiture benefit and estimated costs associated with available riders.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For annuity contracts in the accumulation phase, the main benefit is a contract’s accumulation value. Annuity contracts in the accumulation phase may include surrender charges as well as the costs for any riders elected by the contract owner. For these products, the element of mortality applies to secondary death benefits, such as those provided under a guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) provision.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For straight life annuity contracts in the distribution phase, in simple terms, annuity benefits for a given period are equal to the periodic annuity benefit payment multiplied by the annuitant’s probability of living for that period. Other payout options require different approaches for finding the cost of benefits.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">During modeling and testing for technical product design, the profitability objective (<strong>is / is not</strong>) the only objective tested. If initial testing of the product design produces unsatisfactory results, one change actuaries can make to a model’s assumed values that ordinarily would improve the model’s profitability, all other factors remaining the same, is to (<strong>decrease / increase</strong>) charges to customers.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Once an insurer has created a product design, it must test and validate the design. Tests typically examine whether the product’s profitability, assets, reserves, and cash flows are adequate; tests also can examine interest-rate sensitivity and surplus strain. Actuaries can change some assumed values entered into the model—provided the new values are realistic and actuarially sound—if initial test results are inadequate.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Examples of changes that ordinarily would improve a product model’s profitability, all other factors remaining the same, include a decrease in benefit costs, a decrease in product expenses, an increase in charges to customers, and an increase in assumed investment earnings. The insurer’s real-world operations must be able to support any design adjustment that an actuary makes to the product design.</p>

	<p class="explanations">At the product introduction stage, product implementation consists of establishing the administrative processes necessary to offer the product for sale; product launch occurs when the company finally offers the product for sale. Many product implementation activities begin as early as the technical product design stage, and occur concurrently through technical product design. To speed up the implementation process, companies generally divide product implementation activities into two categories.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Day 1 functionality (the day of product launch) refers to product administration and IT elements that a company must have in place and functioning when the product is first made available for sale. Day 2 functionality (the general period after Day 1) refers to product administration and IT elements that are necessary at some future date to service and administer an insurance product, but which can be implemented after product launch.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In product operations, (<strong>an adverse / a favorable</strong>) deviation produces a decrease in actual product profitability relative to assumed product profitability. Generally, (<strong>an adverse / a favorable</strong>) deviation requires no corrective action.</p>

		<li>a favorable / an adverse</li>
		<li>a favorable / a favorable</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">An adverse deviation is a difference between actual and assumed (or expected) product values that produces a decrease in actual product profitability compared to assumed product profitability. If large adverse deviations develop, then the insurer must try to identify the reasons for them and, if possible, take corrective action, such as cutting operating expenses.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A favorable deviation is a difference between actual and assumed (or expected) product values that produces an increase in actual product profitability relative to assumed product profitability. Although a favorable deviation requires no corrective action, further study may indicate ways that future product design can capitalize on such deviations.</p>

	<p class="explanations">After accumulating experience with a product, an insurer can create and compare tables of actual and expected values, then conduct actual-to-expected (A/E) analysis for different financial variables, such as the cost of benefits and company expenses. A reliable A/E analysis requires years of data; therefore, an insurer may sell a product for years before reliably learning whether the deviations are favorable or not.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In comparisons of actual and expected product values, a difference between the values is a deviation. Deviations can be favorable or adverse.

	<p class="explanations">An adverse deviation occurs whenever a specific product result differs from the modeled assumptions so that actual product revenue is lower than assumed, actual benefits payments are greater than assumed, and/or actual product expenses are greater than assumed. Any amount included in the assumption values to provide an allowance for unexpected negative outcomes is known as a provision for adverse deviation (PAD). Adverse deviations are the reason for including PADs in a deterministic product design.</p>
