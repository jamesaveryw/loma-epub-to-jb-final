<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-28">To develop and launch a new product, an insurance company must spend substantial money now and commit to future obligations in the hope of earning a profit later. The insurer incurs significant upfront costs by establishing reserves, paying sales commissions, utilizing actuarial services, and ensuring compliance.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-29">The conditions surrounding product development, both external and internal, are ever-changing. Economic, demographic, and technological changes occur outside the company, while objectives and technology may change inside the company. Product development requires constant attention to the forces that threaten to pull a product’s objectives in different directions. Figure 5.1 illustrates the opposing forces surrounding new product development for life insurance companies.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-31">Many of the risks detailed in Chapter 2 are risks companies regularly face from in-force life insurance and annuity business. In contrast, <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-newproductrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-8" role="doc-glossref">new product risk</span> refers to any risk that companies face in developing and supporting new life insurance and annuity products. When developing a new product, a company incurs costs that it must recover, while perhaps losing the opportunity to develop an alternative product or products that might have been more profitable. Many risks comprise new product risk.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-32">The most basic new product risk is that a new product never earns a profit at all. Potential causes of inadequate profits or even losses include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-6">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-32">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-33">Inadequate pricing</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-33">

	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-36">A product design that becomes quickly obsolete</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-37">To estimate the cost for an established product, companies and industry groups accumulate experience data to use in projecting the future costs of supporting the product. For new products, however, there is no history. Without relevant experience data, the actuarial staff must invest more time learning about the new product during product design. The insurer might even have to spend money to hire consulting actuaries who can contribute additional experience. The insurer must set standards for acceptable risk levels and must create administrative control systems for identifying risks, monitoring the status of these risks, and managing the most critical risks—all before the product’s risks are fully understood.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-38">To manage new product risk, insurers consider many factors, including the product development strategy, product portfolio and product mix, shelf life, product complexity, customer experience, product management and control, regulatory factors, and other environmental pressures. Let’s explore each of these factors.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch5-div-7">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-1">Product Development Strategy</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-39">In the life insurance industry, products constantly undergo revision and replacement. In this environment, insurers must carefully consider how to position their products for success—and they must do so as early in the product development process as possible. Many insurers begin the process by employing product development strategies.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-40">An insurer may revise or reprice a product in response to shifts in market conditions, regulatory changes, poor product performance, or other circumstances. Many insurers also pursue broader strategies that guide the product development of a product line or even the company as a whole. The following examples describe strategies that insurers can apply to individual products or to entire product lines:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-7">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-36">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-41"><em>Cost Leadership:</em> A simple strategy in many industries is to offer a product at a cost lower than the average cost in the market, or lower than the cost of a comparable product offered by a competitor. A cost leadership strategy requires careful expense control, especially for insurers. In the insurance industry, actuaries must ensure that lower-cost products can still be profitable even if revenues are lower than expected. Insurers may adopt a cost leadership strategy for a new product during times of slow economic growth, when customers with tighter budgets carefully consider the cost of any purchase.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-37">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-42"><em>Focused Differentiation or Niche:</em> When using a focused differentiation or niche strategy, insurers design products that are targeted at a narrow or specialized section of the market. In the life insurance industry, income level is just one category of potential specialized markets. For example, many term life insurance products are designed as lower-cost offerings for customers with more limited means, while advanced market products are created for affluent customers or organizations.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-38">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-43"><em>First Mover:</em> Remember from Chapter 1 that a company using a first mover strategy attempts to be the first to offer a particular product or service. A first mover strategy is often referred to as a <em>market leader strategy</em>, since the first company to enter a market has a reasonable chance of capturing and retaining the largest share of that market. A first mover strategy requires innovation and substantial market research, because the company must determine whether sufficient demand exists for a previously unknown product. In the insurance industry, first mover strategies often involve new companies or startups leveraging technological advances to create products for the growing market of digitally literate consumers.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-39">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-44"><em>Fast Follower:</em> Also remember from Chapter 1 that a fast follower strategy typically involves imitating and iterating on a competitor’s product. The fast follower product is similar to a first mover’s product, but with improvements designed to appeal to a larger portion of potential customers, or refinements based on emerging experience. The fast follower strategy does not require the same degree of market research and innovation that the first mover strategy requires. However, a company needs to be quick and insightful to be able to produce an improved product before the company’s competitors do. In the insurance industry, the fast follower strategy often focuses on taking technological innovations and adapting them to product design.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-45">Note that not all insurers have a clearly defined strategy for product development. An insurer may offer a number of products designed with a cost leadership strategy, yet also develop a new product with a focused differentiation strategy. If the company has the resources and knowledge base to support multiple product development strategies, it can offer a more diverse range of products and therefore appeal to a broader market. This product diversification also aids solvency: when one product line is underperforming, the insurer may still have the revenues from other product lines to help meet its obligations.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch5-div-8">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-2">Product Portfolio and Product Mix</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-46">When launching a new product, a company adds to its <em>product portfolio</em> and alters the proportions of its <em>product mix</em>. In this course, we define the two terms as follows:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-8">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-40">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-47">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-productportfolio" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-9" role="doc-glossref">product portfolio</span> is the array of all products a company offers for sale, categorized by line of business. For example, an insurer might have a life insurance or an annuity portfolio.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-41">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-48">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-productmix" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-10" role="doc-glossref">product mix</span> is a company’s total assortment of products within each line of business according to a monetary measure of business volume, such as premiums collected, reserves, or in the case of life insurance, face amount in force. An insurer typically measures its product mix by proportion.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-49">Thus, a new annuity product would broaden the annuity product portfolio, but would also alter the proportionate amount of reserves held for annuities as a whole. Watch Video 5.1 for a comparison between two companies’ product portfolios and product mixes.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-56">Maintaining a balanced product mix is one form of risk management. Consistent with ALM and ERM practices, insurers manage their product mixes using approaches that are suited for managing any portfolio of risks.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch5-div-22">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-3">Shelf Life</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-57">In the context of product development, <em>shelf life</em> refers to how long an insurer can offer a product in the marketplace before it becomes obsolete and needs to be revised, repriced, or retired. In the United States, insurers typically revise, reprice, or retire the average life insurance or annuity product after one to five years.<span class="ens" id="loma371-ch5-span-18"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma371-ch5-en1" epub:type="noteref" id="loma371-ch5-span-19" role="doc-noteref">1</span> </span> Whole life insurance and life insurance products with riders tend to have longer shelf lives than term life insurance and universal life insurance products. Indexed products, such as indexed universal life insurance products and indexed annuity products, are the most prone to revision or retirement, with an average shelf life of about one to two years. Figure 5.2 shows the typical product shelf life for various life insurance product types, as reported in an industry survey.<span class="ens" id="loma371-ch5-span-20"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma371-ch5-en2" epub:type="noteref" id="loma371-ch5-span-21" role="doc-noteref">2</span> </span></p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-4">Product Complexity</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-59">Complex products that contain multiple benefits, new benefits, or new and unfamiliar features create additional risks. Insurers develop complex products for a variety of reasons—for example, to meet the needs of consumers in target markets, to differentiate their products from those offered by industry competitors, and even to compete against products offered by competitors outside the insurance industry. Part of the risk of complex products is determining the proper pricing for the additional benefits. Another part of the risk is that customers find it easier to understand simpler products, even when a more complex product might suit a customer’s needs better. Figure 5.3 illustrates examples of product complexity.</p>

<figure class="figure numbered-fig" data-mwidth="max-width:1000px;" id="figure5-3">

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-61">Technological innovation can affect the complexity of product design in multiple ways. For example, consumer-facing technology such as health-tracking wearable devices can provide an insurer with detailed data points on an insured person’s heart rate, activity levels, and so on. This data can inform the underwriting process and allows the insurer to create insurance products that offer lower premiums if the insured maintains a more active lifestyle. The varying premium amounts thus add to a product’s complexity.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-62">Company-facing technological advances also make more complex products possible. As mentioned previously, new products have no experience data for insurers to draw on. For these products, companies have increasingly turned to stochastic modeling processes. As you recall from Chapter 4, stochastic modeling enables users to randomly model unknown future events to gain a better understanding of how a product might perform. Technological advances in computing power allow more companies to make greater use of stochastic modeling. In turn, stochastic modeling allows insurers to create complex products such as variable annuities with living benefit riders, which involve anticipating inflation and other variables 20-40 years into the future. However, stochastic modeling still poses challenges to insurers—even in companies where stochastic modeling is established, the processes require continual learning, and the models are subject to ongoing refinements.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch5-div-28">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch5-h4-1">Level of Innovation</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-63">As we discussed earlier, not all products newly introduced to the market represent a totally new product design. A new product can represent slight stylistic adjustments to an existing product or it can offer notable new benefits.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-64">Loosely, <em>innovation</em> refers to an improvement that adds value to a design or process. We can view innovation as existing in degrees, from a very small improvement to a broad, sweeping change. In the context of product development, innovation usually refers to at least a moderate change, because a small change is not likely to interest customers. At the far extreme, innovation can refer to a breakthrough that renders past designs and practices obsolete.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch5-div-29">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch5-p-65">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch5-div-30">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-66">In the insurance industry, a major innovation occurred when companies first offered fixed indexed products. As fixed indexed products gained popularity, insurers modified certain product features—a more limited form of innovation.</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch5-h4-2">Speed to Market</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-67">The more complex a product development project is, the more time the product takes to get to market. Companies typically evaluate product development projects on the basis of complexity.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-5">Customer Experience</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-73">Customer experience has become a vital part of doing business in all industries, including the life insurance industry. The <em>customer experience</em> (frequently abbreviated as <em>CX</em>) is the impression of a company that a customer forms as a result of every interaction the customer has with the company and its representatives. Insurers are finding that customers frequently hold them to a higher standard of customer experience based on their transactions in entirely different industries. Customers often expect to have the same type of positive experience with insurance companies that they have with companies in other industries, such as the retail and service industries.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch5-div-35">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch5-p-74">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch5-div-36">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-75">Hari Mahal purchased an automobile through a dealer’s website, without having to physically visit the dealership or haggle over options and interest rates. When Hari later considered purchasing a life insurance policy, he expected a similarly convenient experience, preferring to go through the purchase process from his own home instead of making an appointment with an agent.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-76">Because customer expectations are so high, delivering an exceptional customer experience must be a priority across the company. Many companies use an <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-omnichannelservicestrategy" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-33" role="doc-glossref">omnichannel service strategy</span> to seamlessly provide a similar, high-quality customer experience across multiple, integrated communication platforms. This strategy seeks to provide a positive experience at each potential point of contact that a customer might have with the company. For example, many customers would prefer using mobile devices to contact a company, while others prefer email, and still others prefer direct telephone calls. An insurer pursuing this strategy works to make each of these potential points of contact, as well as others, a positive customer experience. Many of the changes an insurer would make to pursue an omnichannel service strategy are outside the scope of this course, but this strategy can affect product development.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-77">In the interest of promoting a stronger customer experience, insurance companies are developing products that are more customizable, allowing customers to purchase individualized products that match their individual needs. Certain CX initiatives can also empower the product development process itself.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch5-div-37">

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-6">Product Management and Control</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-80">Effective product management is essential to the product development process. For example, strong product management can create efficiencies in the process that increase a product’s speed to market despite its complexity. An effective product development process has certain characteristics, such as a</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-11">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-55">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-81">Documented product development procedure</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-56">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-82">Development schedule and planned launch date</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-57">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-83">Detailed product development budget and product sales forecasts</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-58">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-84">Formal system for monitoring progress and product performance, including standard project documentation</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-85">A product portfolio requires multiple levels of management, and managers must communicate with one another during the product development process. For example, when the company develops a new term life insurance product, the manager of the specific product must coordinate with the manager of the term life product line and the manager of the company’s life insurance business as a whole.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-86">Successful product management also relies on the efforts of groups of specialists, each of which is proficient in a specific technical area. Much of the time, each group works in isolation from the other groups. In product development, however, the company must assemble cross-functional teams.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-87">A <em>cross-functional team</em> comprises representatives from different functional areas of the company, such as investments, underwriting, actuarial, marketing, and IT. Because each functional area uses its own distinct, technical terms, members of a cross-functional team must take steps to communicate clearly. Examples of cross-functional teams include the following:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-12">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-59">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-88">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-marketingcommittee" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-34" role="doc-glossref">marketing committee</span> is a senior management group whose primary role is to provide overall guidance and control of the product development process. Typical activities include reviewing new product designs and approving or rejecting further development of each new product design.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-60">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-89"><em>The risk committee</em>, discussed previously, is a senior management group whose primary role is to provide overall guidance and control of ERM efforts. This group must ensure that all functional units have appropriately understood, measured, and arranged to manage all the risks associated with a new product. The risk committee reviews all risk exposures, risk policies, risk standards, and risk limits associated with the new product. In addition, this committee must express its support for any new product before the product can be launched. The risk committee should not be confused with the <em>audit committee</em>, which operates independently to oversee financial reporting and disclosure.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-61">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-90">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-productdevelopmentteam" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-35" role="doc-glossref">product development team</span> usually performs hands-on development of a new product. Most large insurance companies have a permanent product development team. Smaller insurers may assemble product development teams on a temporary basis to develop specific products. Product development teams typically include representatives from the company’s marketing, actuarial, underwriting, contract administration, investments, IT, customer service, legal, and accounting areas.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-91">Typically, the product development team in a life insurance company is responsible for the following activities:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-13">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-62">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-92">Conducting research about product features, market demand, competitive activity, target markets, company experience with mortality or morbidity, and customer behavior</p>

	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-63">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-93">Planning, budgeting, and scheduling for product development</p>

	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-96">Guiding product implementation, which includes setting up distribution and administrative operations to support a new product</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-97">An additional product management consideration at many companies is how best to balance in-house and outsourced tasks. Recall from Chapter 3 that outsourcing offers both benefits and challenges to the insurer. Some of the advantages of outsourcing include</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-106">Reinsurance, while not specifically a form of outsourcing, can also play a role in product management. For example, reinsurers can offer assistance in product development and stress testing.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch5-div-40">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-7">Regulatory Factors</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-107">As we discussed in Chapter 2, regulatory risk can be created by changes in the regulatory environment. New or changed laws and regulations can have a profound effect on an insurer’s products. In most instances, a newly passed law or regulation does not take effect immediately—instead, it sets a date in the future by which insurers are expected to be compliant. This practice gives insurers time to make any required changes to their products or processes, but speed is still a key issue for affected insurers. To demonstrate compliance, an insurer makes a policy filing for each of its products. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-policyfiling" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch5-span-36" role="doc-glossref">policy filing</span> is the act of submitting a policy contract form and any other legally required forms and documents to the appropriate state insurance department for approval. Insurers in many U.S. states can also file through the <em>Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact (Insurance Compact)</em>, which acts as a central point for electronic filing for those states, thus reducing the number of policy filings.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch5-p-108">When a company creates a product that is new to the market or to the company, the filing process often takes longer than it would if the company modified an existing product. The more innovative the product, the more time it typically takes for regulators to be satisfied that the new product is fully compliant. As the regulators become familiar with the new product, similar products spend less time in the filing process. Therefore, regulatory issues are likely to have a greater impact on a company pursuing a first mover strategy than they do on a company pursuing a fast follower strategy.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch5-div-41">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch5-h3-8">Other Environmental Pressures</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-109">Regulatory risk is one of the most significant external factors on insurance product development, both for new products and for existing products. However, many other external factors directly affect the market for a new product. Some examples of environmental pressures include the following:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch5-ul-16">
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-74">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-110"><strong>Economic:</strong> The overall state of the economy affects a person’s willingness to spend money. When inflation outpaces wage growth, for example, consumer budgets become more limited, and fewer consumers see insurance as a priority. In such an environment, a product with new features and correspondingly higher premiums is not likely to be as attractive as a product with lower premiums.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-75">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-111"><strong>Technological:</strong> As discussed earlier, customers have increasingly higher expectations for their interactions with a company, especially when it comes to convenience. The ability to purchase an insurance product electronically, for instance, may be the deciding factor in whether a customer purchases a product from a company. However, technological advancements also provide opportunities for product development. Because technological advancements are unlikely to slow down, the opportunities are likely to keep increasing.</p>

</ul>

<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch5-p-112">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch5-div-43">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch5-p-113">The introduction of wearable technology that monitors a wearer’s health and activity levels made it possible for Blocksmith Life Insurance to create a product that offers lower premiums for months when the customer exercises more. Blocksmith found the new product was more difficult to price than its other products, given the additional variables of calculating how many customers would be likely to take advantage of this feature, and what effect their increased exercise might have on mortality. However, Blocksmith decided the possibility of earning lower premiums would be highly attractive to potential customers, especially customers who would appreciate an additional incentive to exercise more.</p>

	<li id="loma371-ch5-li-76">
	<p id="loma371-ch5-p-114"><strong>Demographic:</strong> Different demographics have different purchasing patterns. For instance, younger generations are more likely to prefer purchasing services electronically, while older generations might favor researching services electronically but purchasing them in face-to-face transactions. As demographics shift, product development teams must consider what product features would have greater appeal for the growing sections of the market.</p>
