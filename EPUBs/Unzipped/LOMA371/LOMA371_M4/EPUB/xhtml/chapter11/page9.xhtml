<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-228">As you read earlier, a variable annuity allows a contract owner to choose investments for the contract via the insurance company’s subaccount menu. The contract's value fluctuates in accordance with the performance of the selected subaccounts. As such, growth in a variable contract’s accumulated value is not certain.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-229">Recall that for variable annuities, the contract owner bears the investment risk for subaccount performance. Variable annuity owners seeking to mitigate their investment risk can obtain guaranteed benefits in the form of riders. Because the insurer guarantees variable annuity rider benefits, it administers variable annuity riders within its general account, as it does with fixed annuities. (Variable annuity premiums allocated to subaccounts are managed through an insurer’s separate accounts.)</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-230">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-ridercharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch11-span-93" role="doc-glossref">rider charge</span>, or <em>rider premium</em>, is the additional charge for a variable annuity contract owner to purchase a rider. Typically, the rider charge is a specified percentage—such as 0.75 percent—of the contract’s benefit base, which is different than its accumulated value. The <em>benefit base</em>, also called the <em>income base</em>, is a theoretical account value that grows at a guaranteed rate—as specified in the variable annuity contract—and is used as the basis for calculating guaranteed withdrawal amounts.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-231">The rider charge, which the insurer subtracts from the contract’s accumulated value, covers the company’s costs for the following elements:</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch11-h3-8">Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit Riders</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-238">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-guaranteedminimumdeathbenefit" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch11-span-94" role="doc-glossref">guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB)</span> generally guarantees that the variable annuity death benefit will at least equal a specified minimum amount. Most variable annuities specify a minimum amount equal to the <em>greater</em> of (1) all premiums paid—adjusted for withdrawals—or (2) the contract’s accumulated value at the time of the annuitant’s death.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-109">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch11-p-239">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch11-div-110">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-240">Wei-Chao Chen purchases a variable deferred annuity with a single premium payment of $500,000. Mr. Chen is the contract’s owner and its annuitant. Mr. Chen’s variable annuity has a GMDB equal to the greater of all premiums paid—adjusted for withdrawals—and the accumulated value at the date of death. When Mr. Chen dies, he has taken no withdrawals from his annuity and his contract’s accumulated value has fallen to $300,000.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-241"><strong>Analysis</strong>: The contract’s accumulated value—$300,000—fell below the premium amount that Mr. Chen paid—$500,000. Therefore, the death benefit of his annuity is the greater of the two values: $500,000.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-242">Variable annuity guaranteed death benefits continue to evolve in ways that benefit contract owners and their beneficiaries. Because newer forms of GMDBs generally result in higher guaranteed death benefits, they are more expensive than the traditional guaranteed death benefit described above. These newer forms of GMDBs include annually compounded death benefits, ratcheted death benefits, and highest anniversary value death benefits. As you’ll see, no matter what kind of GMDB a variable annuity has, the beneficiary always receives the <em>greatest</em> value available—whether it’s the accumulated value or a specified benefit—as stated in the contract.</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch11-h4-4">Annually Compounded Death Benefit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-243">The <em>annually compounded death benefit</em> resembles the common guaranteed minimum death benefit described above. The difference is that the contract’s principal (minus withdrawals) is compounded annually at a specified rate, such as 3–5 percent per year.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-112">

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-246"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Suppose Mr. Chen dies five years after purchasing his variable annuity.

<h4 id="loma371-ch11-h4-5">Ratcheted Death Benefit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-247">Under the <em>ratcheted death benefit</em>, the insurer resets the contract’s death benefit at periodic intervals, based on growth in the accumulated value. The most common reset period is in the four- to six-year range. Once the insurer resets the death benefit, it can never be less than this amount, unless there are withdrawals from the contract.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-115">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch11-p-248">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch11-div-116">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-249">Assume that Mr. Chen’s variable annuity has a ratcheted death benefit with a five-year reset period. Five years after he purchases his variable annuity, his contract’s accumulated value has grown to $580,000. Thus, the insurer resets the death benefit of Mr. Chen’s variable annuity to $580,000. If, after five more years, the accumulated value is even higher, that new value would become the guaranteed death benefit.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch11-div-117">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch11-h4-6">Highest Anniversary Value Death Benefit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-250">The <em>highest anniversary value death benefit</em> is a variation of the ratcheted death benefit. The difference is that, instead of resetting the death benefit at predetermined intervals—such as every five years—the death benefit is reset every anniversary year in which the accumulated value increases.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-118">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch11-p-251">EXAMPLE</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-256"><strong>Analysis</strong>: On March 5, 2018—the first anniversary date—the contract’s accumulated value had fallen to $480,000. Thus, the insurer did not apply the reset, and the contract’s guaranteed death benefit equaled Mr. Chen’s premium payment of $500,000 (assuming no withdrawals). On March 5, 2019, the accumulated value had grown, so the insurer reset the death benefit to $550,000. On the next anniversary date—March 5, 2020—the insurer did not reset the death benefit because the accumulated value fell from the previous anniversary date.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-257">If Mr. Chen were to die in July 2020, his beneficiary would receive $550,000—assuming this amount is greater than the contract’s accumulated value and no withdrawals were taken from the contract after the reset.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch11-h3-9">Living Benefit Riders</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-258">Variable annuity guaranteed living benefits can be referred to as “GLBs.” Living benefits typically offer some type of guaranteed benefit while the annuitant is alive. When a variable annuity contract owner purchases a living benefit rider, the contract essentially has two values: the accumulated value and the <em>living benefit value</em>, which is based on the insurance company’s guarantees for that particular contract. Because living benefits are guaranteed, insurers must establish reserves for them and be prepared to make benefit payments that become due.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-259">From a customer’s perspective, living benefits can provide protection against market losses: if a variable annuity contract’s accumulated value falls due to poor market performance, the living benefit value is unaffected. Thus, variable annuity contract owners can use living benefit riders to hedge their investment risk. Put differently, living benefit riders essentially enable variable annuity contract owners to share their investment risk with insurers.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-260">From an insurer’s perspective, living benefits introduce the risk that a variable annuity’s separate account assets will not be sufficient to cover the contract’s living benefit value, thus necessitating contributions from the insurer’s general account assets. Because living benefit riders increase the risk assumed by insurers, most insurers impose limits on the investment choices of variable annuity contract owners who purchase living benefits. For example, insurers may not offer some of the most aggressive subaccounts to contract owners who select a GLB.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-261">Most variable annuity contracts offer one or more of the following living benefit riders: guaranteed minimum income benefits, guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits, and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch11-div-121">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch11-h4-7">Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-262">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-guaranteedminimumincomebenefit" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch11-span-95" role="doc-glossref">guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB)</span> is a living benefit rider that guarantees a minimum protected value that can be converted into periodic income payments—usually after a waiting period of seven to ten years—even if the variable annuity’s accumulated value declines because of poor investment performance. The minimum protected value may specify some growth of the principal, such as an annual compound interest rate, or locked-in investment gains at maximum contract anniversary values. The GMIB requires the contract owner to annuitize the contract to receive the benefit.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-122">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch11-p-263">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch11-div-123">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-264">Let’s return to our variable annuity contract owner, Wei-Chao Chen, who purchases his variable annuity with a single premium payment of $500,000. Assume that Mr. Chen also purchases a GMIB rider that stipulates a growth rate of 5 percent compounded per year. The GMIB rider requires a waiting period of 10 years.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-265"><strong>Analysis</strong>: After 10 years, the accumulated value of Mr. Chen’s annuity is $450,000. However, the living benefit value is $814,447.31, found as $500,000 <strong>×</strong> (1.05)<span class="ens" id="loma371-ch11-span-96"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma371-ch11-en10" epub:type="noteref" id="loma371-ch11-span-97" role="doc-noteref">10</span> </span>. Mr. Chen could decide to annuitize his variable annuity and receive annual income payments based on the living benefit value. If he annuitizes his contract, his insurer would determine the lifetime payment amount by applying a guaranteed annuitization rate that was stipulated in the rider at the contract’s issue.</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch11-h4-8">Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-266">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-guaranteedminimumwithdrawalbenefit" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch11-span-98" role="doc-glossref">guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB)</span> is a living benefit rider that guarantees a minimum protected value against which a variable annuity contract owner may make annual withdrawals of a specified amount, without charge, even if the contract’s accumulated value falls below the protected value as a result of poor investment performance. GMWB riders offer contract owners some protection against market downturns without requiring annuitization of contracts.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-125">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch11-p-267">EXAMPLE</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-268">Instead of a GMIB, assume that Mr. Chen purchases a GMWB that stipulates he can annually withdraw 5 percent of the contract’s principal of $500,000. One year later, the accumulated value of his contract is $400,000. Mr. Chen decides to use the living benefit to make a withdrawal from his contract.</p>

<p class="txt-ni"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Mr. Chen withdraws $25,000 (found as $500,000 × 0.05). Because of his GMWB rider, Mr. Chen could withdraw $25,000 a year until he has used up the contract’s protected value. At that rate of withdrawal, the protected value of $500,000 should last for 20 years (found as $500,000 ÷ $25,000 per year = 20 years).</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch11-div-127">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch11-h4-9">Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-269">Closely related to the GMWB, the <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-guaranteedlifetimewithdrawalbenefit" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch11-span-99" role="doc-glossref">guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB)</span> is a living benefit rider that guarantees minimum withdrawals to a variable annuity owner for life. The main difference between the GMWB and the GLWB is duration: GMWB withdrawals are guaranteed for a specified period, while GLWB withdrawals are guaranteed for the life of the contract owner. For the GLWB, the withdrawal amount is usually specified as a percentage of the contract’s living benefit value or accumulated value, whichever is greater. With a GLWB, the contract owner is not required to annuitize the contract.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch11-div-128">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch11-p-270">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch11-div-129">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-271">Now assume that Mr. Chen’s GMWB is a GLWB. One year after purchasing his variable annuity, Mr. Chen decides to use the living benefit. The accumulated value of his contract is $400,000, and the principal is $500,000.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-272"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Because the contract’s principal amount of $500,000 is higher than its accumulated value of $400,000, the insurer bases the GLWB calculation on the principal amount. The insurer uses Mr. Chen’s current age to determine the percentage that will apply to the principal. This percentage of the principal is the amount that will be withdrawn and disbursed to Mr. Chen for the rest of his life. The insurer determines that Mr. Chen’s withdrawal rate is 5%, so he will receive lifetime annual disbursements of $25,000 (found as $500,000 × 0.05).</p>

Usually, the contract owner must wait for a specified period—typically from seven to ten years—before the guaranteed value provided under the GMAB becomes available.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch11-p-274">The amount of the GMAB’s protected value is generally equal to a return of the contract owner’s premium or the premium plus a modest growth factor. With a GMAB, the contract owner is not required to annuitize the contract and thus can still earn future investment gains.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch11-p-277"><strong>Analysis</strong>: Because of the GMAB, Mr. Chen’s contract has a protected value of $500,000 after the eight-year waiting period, even though the actual accumulated value is lower.</p>
