Consider the following whole life insurance policyowners:</p>

The insurer pays Mr.&#160;Darby monthly benefits until a specified percentage of the face amount has been paid out.

		<li>waiver of premium benefit, and Mr.&#160;Darby exercised the LTC insurance benefit</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">One type of waiver of premium benefit is the waiver of premium for disability benefit, under which the insurer promises to give up its right to collect premiums that become due while the insured is disabled according to the policy or rider’s definition of disability. Another type of waiver of premium benefit is the waiver of premium for payor benefit, in which the insurer waives its right to collect a policy’s renewal premiums if the payor—the person paying the policy premiums—dies or becomes totally disabled.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Generally, the accidental death benefit is payable if the insured’s death was caused—directly and independently of all other causes—by an accidental bodily injury. Some policies include accelerated death benefits, also known as living benefits, which typically allow a policyowner to elect to receive all or part of the policy’s death benefit before the insured’s death if certain conditions are met.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The payment of an accelerated death benefit usually reduces the death benefit that will be paid to the beneficiary at the insured’ &amp; bsp;death. Under a critical illness benefit—also known as a dread disease benefit—the insurer agrees to pay a portion of the policy’s face amount to the policyowner if the insured suffers from a specified disease. With a long-term care (LTC) insurance benefit, the insurer agrees to pay a monthly benefit to the policyowner if the insured requires constant care for a medical condition.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurance companies use premiums for reserves and pricing. The portion of premiums used for reserves are set aside to pay future contract obligations and meet mandated reserve requirements. A pricing premium is the monetary amount per unit of coverage that an insurer must collect from customers to cover any portion of the product’s cost of benefits or the insurer’s costs for supporting the product that is not covered by investment earnings.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Pricing premiums can take the following forms: simple premiums, level premiums, and flexible premiums. Single premiums typically purchase one-year term life insurance policies. Typically, level premiums purchase multiyear term life insurance and whole life insurance policies. Flexible premiums typically purchase universal life insurance policies.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">A life insurer is estimating the future death benefits and the present value (PV) of the estimated future death benefits for a block of 10,000 one-year term life insurance policies issued to men ag &amp; bsp;44. The insurer determined that the mortality rate for the block of policies is 0.31 per 1,000 lives. The assumed policy size is $100,000, all benefit payments are assumed to be made at the exact midpoint of the year, the policies are assumed to be issued at the beginning of the year, and the assumed interest rate for the policies is 8%. For this estimate, the insurer gathered the following present value interest factors (PVIFs):</p>

	<ul class="examul">
		<li>PVIF(½, 8%) = 0.962</li>
		<li>PVIF(1, 8%) = 0.926</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">This information indicates that the insurer most likely would estimate that the future death benefits for this block of one-year term life insurance policies equals</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">

		<li>$100,000, and the PV of the estimated future death benefits equals $96,200</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">To obtain the mortality rate for one life, divide the mortality rate for 1,000 lives by 1,000: 0.31 ÷ 1,000 = 0.00031. To project an average of how many of the 10,000 insureds will die during the year, multiply the mortality rate for one life by the number of insureds in the block: 0.00031 × 10,000 = 3.1 deaths. For pricing purposes, use the actuarial estimate of 3.1 deaths, rather than 3.0 or 4.0 deaths. Use the future death benefits formula to determine the total amount of future estimated death benefits for this block of policies: 3.1 deaths during the year multiplied by the $100,000 policy face amount equals $310,000.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The PV of the estimated future death benefits is calculated by multiplying the total amount of future estimated death benefits by the corresponding PVIF for 8% interest (<em>i</em>) and a ½-year period (<em>n</em>): $310,000 × 0.962 = $298,220. The PVIF for a ½-year period (<em>n</em>) is used because it is assumed that all death benefit payments are made at the exact midpoint of the year.</p>

		<li>level annual premiums (LAPs) are collected at the midpoint of each year</li>
		<li>final benefit payments will be made when the insured group reaches age 99</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Whole life insurance products have two features that usually are not present for one-year and most multiyear term life insurance products: death benefit coverage while the policy remains in force during the lifetime of the insured, and cash value and surrender benefits. For a block of whole life policies, the number of insureds decreases each year because some insureds die and others lapse their policies.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In calculating the total future benefits for most whole life insurance products, several general assumption apply. Level annual premiums (LAPs) are collected at the beginning of each year; death benefits are paid at the midpoint of each year. Surrender benefits, which do not begin until the policy has been in force for several years, are paid at the beginning of each year. Final benefit payments for this plan of insurance will be made when the insured group reaches an advanced age, such as age 120.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To cover the insurer’s cost of benefits—and the other premium components, such as operating expenses—actuaries must find a LAP amount for which the sum of the present values of the premium payments is equivalent to the present value of a hypothetical single premium. The process of estimating the mortality cost for a block of whole life insurance policies is to project the number of benefit payments for the term’s duration; determine the average amount of death benefit paid within the block of policies; estimate the future value of death benefits for the entire block; find the present value of the block’s future death benefits—the single premium, and then calculate the monetary amount of the level annual premium (LAP), which is any set of equal annual payments having a present value equal to a given single premium.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Universal life (UL) insurance is a form of cash value life insurance that is characterized by flexible premiums, a flexible face amount, a flexible death benefit amount, and separation of the three primary policy elements—mortality charges, interest rate, and expense charges.</p>

	<p class="explanations">UL insurance is available in a number of varieties, including basic fixed universal life (UL) insurance, indexed universal life (IUL) insurance, and variable universal life (VUL) insurance.

	<p class="explanations">UL death benefits can take three alternative forms: An Option A plan has a level amount death benefit, and the net amount at risk is equal to the policy’s face amount. An Option B plan has an increasing amount death benefit, and the net amount at risk is equal to the policy’s face amount. An Option C plan has a level amount plus premiums death benefit, and the net amount at risk is equal to the sum of the policy’s face amount and premiums paid, minus the cash value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Although definitions vary from one contract to another, a UL policy’s net amount at risk generally represents the amount of the insurer’s funds that would be required at any given time to pay the policy death benefit. Therefore, at any given time, a UL policy’s net amount at risk equals the difference between the death benefit and the cash value: Net amount at risk = Death benefit – Cash value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Assuming the face amount remains the same, with an Option A plan, as the policy’s cash value grows, the insurer’s net amount at risk decreases. With an Option B plan, as the policy’s cash value grows, the death benefit grows, but the insurer’s net amount at risk stays constant. With an Option C plan, the net amount at risk fluctuates, depending on the amount of premiums the policyowner pays and any changes made to the policy’s cash value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The relationships between the premium components are illustrated in the following calculation to set a product’s pricing premium rates: Charge for cost of benefits +Charge for operating expenses + Contribution to insurer earnings – Investment earning &amp; bsp;= Premium payments. An insurer invests a portion of the premiums it receives and expects to achieve investment earnings. Investment earnings enable the insurer to set a product’s base premium lower than the sum of its expected cost of benefits and operatin &amp; bsp;expenses.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Actuaries use the premium components to calculate the premium for a block of policies. Next, they establish the premium rate for the block by dividing the single premium by the number of policies in the block. The premium rate is expressed as a unit of coverage; for life insurance, a unit of coverage usually is $1,000 of coverage.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To find the premium amount to charge for a particular policy, the insurer multiplies the premium rate by the number of coverage units. The product’s premium rate represents the base rate that the insurer charges to policyowners in the block.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">One way to look at the benefits under annuities is by annuity type. For instance, fixed immediate annuities have a payout period, but no accumulation period. Therefore, such annuities do not pay death benefits or surrender or withdrawal benefits. Because fixed-rate and variable deferred annuities have an accumulation period, they have the potential to pay death benefits, surrender benefits, and or withdrawa &amp; bsp;benefits.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Insurers estimate annuity benefits and the cost considerations for each benefit cost. Annuity benefits include future annuity death benefits, surrender benefits, withdrawal benefits, and periodic income payments. The following statements are about how insurers estimate the cost of future deferred annuity death benefits. Select the answer choice containing the correct statement.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>The amount of a future death benefit depends only on the amount of premiums paid on th &amp; bsp;contract.</li>
		<li>Insurers ignore expected surrenders when determining the number of death benefits payable each year.</li>
		<li>Withdrawal rates for deferred annuities are usually the lowest during the early years of the accumulation period.</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The total cost of benefits for an annuity equals the sum of the present value of each potential benefit multiplied by the expected probability that each benefit will be payable. The process used to estimate the cost of future deferred annuity death benefits is similar to that used to estimate the cost of life insurance death benefits. In addition, the formula for determining annuity premiums is similar to that for determining life insurance premiums: the charge for cost of benefits + the charge for operating expenses + the provision for adverse deviation or contributions to earnings – investment earnings.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers estimate the cost of surrender benefits for a future year based on the number of in-force contracts at the beginning of the year, the expected surrender rate for each year, and the surrender value per unit. Insurers assume that surrender benefits will be paid at the beginning of each year. Insurers use the contractually specified withdrawal rate percents—usually 5-10 percent of the contract’s accumulated value each year—to determine the cost of withdrawals for each year during the accumulation period. Then, insurers sum the annual surrender benefits and the withdrawal values for each year during the accumulation period to determine the total value of the surrenders and withdrawals.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers generally calculate the present values (PVs) of their future payments and sum the PVs to estimate the total cost of periodic income payments. For guaranteed annuity payout options, the insurer’s cost of future payments at the start of the payout period equals a deferred annuity contract’s accumulated value at the maturity date, or conversion date, when the contract is annuitized. Life annuity payout options expose insurers to mortality risk because calculations for life annuities rely on the mortality experience of a population of annuitants. Insurers must estimate the cost of the lifetime guarantees based on the life expectancies of th &amp; bsp;annuitants.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A single life annuity with period certain guarantees periodic income payments throughout the lifetime of the annuitant and also guarantees that the payments will continue for at least a specified period. If the annuitant dies before the end of the specified period, the insurer provides the periodic income payments to the beneficiary until the end of the period.

	<p class="q-stem-static">Admiral Insurance issued a fixed indexed annuity (FIA) that has a 90% participation percentage, a 7% cap, and no yield spread.

	<p class="explanations">A participation percentage provision stipulates the rate at which the insurer shares the reference index’s growth with the contract owner. A cap is an upper limit on the amount of a reference index’s gain in value that the insurer credits to the annuity contract as interest. The insurer limits the percentage amount of interest it credits to the contract to the capped rate.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, for a period in which the reference index increased by 8%, a participation percentage of 90% reduces the growth rate credited to the FIA contract’s accumulated value to 7.2%.

	<p class="explanations">Under the annual reset method, also known as the ratchet method, index values are reset at the beginning of each contract year during the term of the contract. The annual reset method allows the contract owner to lock in gains each year and avoid losses. When the market goes up, the contract owner earns excess interest. When the market remains stable or goes down, the contract neither gains nor loses value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To calculate the growth of Ms.&#160;Hubley’s FIA at the end of Year 1, calculate how much the reference index grew: (800 – 750) ÷ 750 = 6.67% at the end of Year 1. Adjusting the 6.67% growth in the index by the 75% participation percentage results in (6.67% × 0.75) = 5% interest. Because 5% is less than the 10% cap, the interest rate to apply to the FIA contract value at the end of Year 1 is 5%. The accumulated value of the FIA is $200,000 × 1.05 = $210,000, which is the FIA contract value at the beginning of Year 2.</p>

	<p class="explanations">At the end of Year 2, the reference index grew by (875 – 800) ÷ 800 = 9.38%. Adjusting the growth in the index by the 75% participation percentage results in (9.38% × 0.75) = 7.03% interest. Because 7.03% is less than the 10% cap, the interest rate to apply to the FIA contract value at the end of Year 1 is 7.03%. The accumulated value of the FIA is $210,000 × 1.0703 = $224,763 at the end of Year 2, which is the FIA contract value at the beginning of Year 3.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The point-to-point, annual reset, and high water mark methods allow the contract owner to take advantage of index gains without being subject to index losses. The advantage of using high water marks instead of methods that use term-end or year-end values is that earnings are not dependent on index growth at the end of each term (point-to-point method) or contract year (annual reset method). Under the high water mark method, the index need only show growth on any contract anniversary date to earn index credits.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Various annuity guarantee riders—including guaranteed minimum death benefit riders and living benefit riders—are available to variable annuity contract owners. Two living benefit riders are the guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) and the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB). The GMIB guarantees a minimum protected value that can be converted into annuity periodic income payments—usually after a waiting period of seven to ten years—(<strong>but not if / eve &amp; bsp;if</strong>) the variable annuity’s accumulated value declines because of poor investment performance. Under a GMAB, the contract owner (<strong>is / is not</strong>) required to annuitize the contract.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">For variable annuities, the contract owner bears the investment risk for subaccount performance. Variable annuity premiums allocated to subaccounts are managed through an insurer’s separate accounts. Variable annuity owners that seek to mitigate their investment risk can obtain guaranteed benefits in the form of riders. Because the insurer guarantees variable annuity rider benefits, the insurer administers variable annuity riders within its general account, as it does with fixed annuities.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Some of the variable annuity guarantee riders available to contract owners include types of guaranteed minimum death benefit riders and living benefit riders. A guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) generally guarantees that the variable annuity death benefit will at least equal a specified minimum amount. Newer forms of GMDBs, which are more expensive than traditional forms, generally result in higher guaranteed death benefits. These newer forms of GMDBs include annually compounded death benefits, ratcheted death benefits, and highest anniversary value death benefits.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Variable annuity guarantee living benefits can be referred to as “GLBs.” The contract essentially has two values: the accumulated value and the living benefit value. Because living benefits are guaranteed, insurers must establish reserves for them and make benefit payments as they become due. Most variable annuity contracts offer one or more of the following living benefit riders: a guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) rider, a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider, a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) rider, and a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) rider.</p>
