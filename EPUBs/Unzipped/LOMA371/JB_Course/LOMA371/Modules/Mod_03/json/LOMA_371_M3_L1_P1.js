If an insurer were to rely only on premium income to pay its expenses and meet its contractual obligations, the premiums for all its products would have to be much higher than they would otherwise be—higher, probably, than most customers would be willing to pay. Instead, an insurer uses the premiums it collects to purchase assets for its investment portfolios, which accumulate value over time. The insurer then uses these assets and their associated earnings to cover the company’s expenses and establish the reserves necessary to meet the company’s contractual obligations."
