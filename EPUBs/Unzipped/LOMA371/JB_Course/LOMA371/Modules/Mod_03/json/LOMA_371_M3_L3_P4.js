Typically, a lapse rate that is higher than projected is a potential risk to a product’s profitability. While lapses are generally considered negative occurrences because they result in a loss of revenue, <em>lapse-supported products</em> are designed to be profitable in the face of higher lapse rates. For such products, a lapse rate that is <em>lower</em> than projected would be a potential risk to profitability."

A withdrawal is also known as a <em>partial surrender</em> or <em>policy withdrawal</em>. Not all cash value life insurance policies permit withdrawals of cash value. Insurers typically allow customers to withdraw a certain percentage of the cash value or accumulated value each year without charge, such as 7 to 10 percent.

For example, the cash value on some universal life insurance products earns interest based on current market interest rates, which influences policyholder behavior when market interest rates rise, fall, or remain stagnant. To take these variables into consideration, insurers increasingly use stochastic assumptions when modeling possible future policyholder behavior for products with nonguaranteed elements."
