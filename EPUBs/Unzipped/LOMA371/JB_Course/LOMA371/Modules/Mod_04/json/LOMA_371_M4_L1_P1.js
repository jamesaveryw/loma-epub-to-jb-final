In addition, profits that appear excessive are likely to attract regulatory scrutiny."

As you can see in Figure 10.1, the product components representing cash inflows are premium payments from customers and the investment earnings on those premiums. Product components representing cash outflows are the charge for the cost of benefits, the charge for operating expenses, and the provision for adverse deviation—effectively, a margin that protects against potential losses on the product due to unfavorable experience. The provision for adverse deviation could turn into a contribution to the insurer’s earnings, as we will explain later."
