Recall from Chapter 2 that <em>policyholder behavior</em> refers to the benefit utilization choices of customers who own life insurance or annuities, and <em>policyholder behavior risk</em> refers to the risk that policyholder actions or decisions will adversely affect product performance. For example, more policyholders may stop paying their premiums than the project design team had anticipated for the year. Because circumstances can vary widely from customer to customer and even from month to month, policyholder behavior risks can be difficult to incorporate into deterministic models. However, stochastic product modeling can allow for effective modeling of policyholder behavior when deterministic product modeling is not sufficient."

From an actuarial perspective, a product’s design consists of modeling the financial results for one or multiple sets of estimated values and comparing the resulting values to established objectives for the product. The tests typically examine whether the product’s profitability, assets, reserves, and cash flows are adequate. Tests can also examine interest-rate sensitivity as well as other concerns such as <em>surplus strain</em>, which is the decrease in an insurer’s surplus caused by the first-year costs and reserve requirements associated with a new product."
