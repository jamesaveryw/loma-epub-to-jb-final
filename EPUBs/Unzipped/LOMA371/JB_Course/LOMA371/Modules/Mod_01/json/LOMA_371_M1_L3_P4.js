As we described in Chapter 1, <em>enterprise risk management (ERM)</em> <strong> </strong>is a system that identifies and quantifies risks from both potential threats and potential opportunities and manages these risks in a coordinated approach that supports the organization’s strategic objectives. ERM takes a top-down, enterprise-wide approach to viewing <em>all</em> of the significant risks that could affect an insurer’s strategic objectives. According to ERM, risk is any negative consequence a company faces as it conducts its operations, including the failure to meet objectives or to exploit profitable opportunities."

The key differences between the two systems are the number of risks encompassed and ERM’s inclusion of risk as an opportunity for gain. Although an insurer’s actuaries and investment specialists are responsible for managing a company’s ERM activities, all employees should recognize how ERM programs differ from other traditional risk management techniques. The following table summarizes the differences between traditional risk management and ERM."
