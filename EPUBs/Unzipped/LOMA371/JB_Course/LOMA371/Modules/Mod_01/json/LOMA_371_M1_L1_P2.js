An <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">investment</span> is any use of a company’s resources that is intended to generate a profit or positive return of some type.

Mutual insurers may pay <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">policy dividends</span>, or <em>policyowner dividends</em>, which are returns of excess premium paid to the owners of individual participating life insurance policies. Stock insurers, on the other hand, may pay <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">stockholder dividends</span>, which are a portion of a stock insurer’s capital paid—in cash or in additional shares of stock—to the owners of the insurer’s stock. Paying dividends benefits the insurer by increasing policyowner and stockholder satisfaction; dividend payments also sometimes lower the amount of taxes that an insurer must pay. Other benefits of strong profitability are listed in Figure 1.2. Note that a profitable company might not enjoy all of these advantages at once. For example, a profitable company might not have ample cash available for investing in a given time period because it recently reinvested a portion of its profits."

Investment losses could impair a company’s ability to pay benefits as they come due. Because an investment loss can affect an insurer’s ability to pay policy benefits and other liabilities, regulators and rating agencies closely monitor the investments made by insurance companies. Furthermore, the perceived safety of an insurance company, often based on how various rating agencies judge an insurer, greatly influences whether a customer purchases products from the company."
