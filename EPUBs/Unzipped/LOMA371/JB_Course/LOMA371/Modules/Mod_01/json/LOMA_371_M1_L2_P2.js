The NAIC is a private, nonprofit association of the insurance commissioners of 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. The NAIC’s primary function is to promote uniformity of state insurance regulation by developing model laws and regulations that serve as guidelines for the states. As you will see, the NAIC has developed many model laws and regulations that influence a number of insurer practices: contractual reserves, capital requirements, reinsurance, data security, investment valuation, corporate governance, and so on."

This approach is unlike the more formulaic rules-based approach, where assumptions are prescribed and locked in when policies are issued. PBR attempts to “rightsize” an insurer’s reserves, so that the reserves an insurer holds are based on either prescribed factors or on the insurer’s own experience and risks, whichever is greater. This rightsizing is important for establishing appropriate reserve levels because reserves that are too high can mean consumers pay higher prices for products than needed, and reserves that are too low can threaten an insurer’s ability to pay contractual benefits. By enabling insurers to calculate and report more accurate estimates for their statutory reserves, PBR enhances the reporting function and strengthens the financial position of the insurers that use it."

Based on Basel III, Solvency II is also known as the <em>EU Directive on the Taking-up and Pursuit of the Business of Insurance and Reinsurance</em>. Solvency II introduced RBC requirements, which influenced the asset allocation decisions of many insurers in the EU. One of the key elements of Solvency II is the ORSA, which other countries and jurisdictions, including the United States, have adopted and implemented. The ORSA program in Solvency II requires each insurer to determine the capital necessary to ensure its overall solvency needs are met at all times."
