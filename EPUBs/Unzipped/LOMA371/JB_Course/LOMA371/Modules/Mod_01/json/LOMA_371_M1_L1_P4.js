An <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">actuary</span> is a technical expert in insurance, annuities, and financial instruments who applies mathematical knowledge to industry and company statistics to calculate various financial values.

Some actuaries occupy specialized positions, such as focusing on a specific product line, while others are responsible for tasks across different company functions. A notable aspect of actuarial work is the effort to anticipate circumstances beyond the company’s control by modeling unexpected outcomes and their impacts. While nobody can project changes due to external forces with 100 percent accuracy, well-constructed financial models provide more accurate estimations of the probability and impact of such changes. Overall, the actuarial function of calculating probable risks and returns is vital to both risk management and technical product design. The insight below discusses how an insurer might organize its actuarial function."

As we’ll explore further in this text, technical product design requires the calculation of probable outcomes based on a variety of actuarial assumptions and variables. How much premium should the company charge? What happens if interest rates increase, decrease, or are stagnant? Will a life insurance product still be profitable if mortality rates are higher than expected? Will an annuity product still be profitable if longevity rates are higher than expected? Addressing all these variables requires the mathematical, statistical, and computer expertise of an actuary."

Therefore, technical product design relies on averages and probabilities. Actuaries extrapolate these figures based on the law of large numbers. The <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">law of large numbers</span> is a mathematical concept which states that, under normal circumstances, the more times a particular event is observed, the more likely it is that the observations will approximate the “true” probability that the event will occur. Mortality tables are one example of probabilities determined by the law of large numbers. A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">mortality table</span> is a statistical table that shows the number of people in a cohort—or group of people—and the number or rate of deaths for the cohort at given ages—that is, how many deaths may be expected at each age. Actuaries build mortality tables by examining demographics on a large scale and recording the average mortality results by age, sex, risk class, and other such factors."

The structure of life insurance products, however, alters the nature of this calculation. A company that sells office chairs, for instance, pays most of the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and shipping up front, and then receives the revenue from sales. However, an insurer receives the revenue from sales for a life insurance product <em>before</em> the insurer is required to pay the primary expense of the product—that is, the death benefit amount. Furthermore, at the time of the product’s sale, there is no set date for the claim payment. An insurer may pay the death benefit within one year, twenty years from the policy issue date, or in some cases, not at all. Calculating the profitability of a life insurance product therefore requires both modeling a range of possible outcomes and analyzing historical data in as much detail as possible. We discuss profitability measurement further in Chapter 7."
