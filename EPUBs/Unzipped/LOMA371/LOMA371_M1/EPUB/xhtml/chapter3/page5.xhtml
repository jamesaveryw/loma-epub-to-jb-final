<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-146">The topics discussed so far in this chapter are common components of risk management programs for life insurance companies. As we described in Chapter 1, <em>enterprise risk management (ERM)</em> <strong> </strong>is a system that identifies and quantifies risks from both potential threats and potential opportunities and manages these risks in a coordinated approach that supports the organization’s strategic objectives. ERM takes a top-down, enterprise-wide approach to viewing <em>all</em> of the significant risks that could affect an insurer’s strategic objectives. According to ERM, risk is any negative consequence a company faces as it conducts its operations, including the failure to meet objectives or to exploit profitable opportunities.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-147">ERM and traditional risk management share many specific practices in common, such as employing a CRO, maintaining a risk committee, and establishing a risk taxonomy. The key differences between the two systems are the number of risks encompassed and ERM’s inclusion of risk as an opportunity for gain. Although an insurer’s actuaries and investment specialists are responsible for managing a company’s ERM activities, all employees should recognize how ERM programs differ from other traditional risk management techniques. The following table summarizes the differences between traditional risk management and ERM.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-160">Recent regulations have been strong drivers in pushing financial institutions and insurers to adopt ERM. Two examples of such regulations are the NAIC’s Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Model Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act).</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-161">Most insurers practice ERM to some extent, although some insurers implement ERM practices and techniques to a greater degree than do others. An effective ERM program typically includes the following components: (1) a risk management culture, (2) strategic risk management, (3) a risk control process, (4) a risk management framework, and (5) catastrophic event management.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-70">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-9">Risk Management Culture</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-162">Although ERM begins at the top level of an organization, it must reach all areas of the organization to be successful. Whether a company uses a CRO, a risk committee, or some combination of the two, the company must establish a risk management culture.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-163">Individuals at all levels of the company are responsible for risk management—not just the risk management department or senior management. Every employee is a stakeholder and part owner of a risk. Although the company’s board of directors and senior management have the primary authority for establishing the risk management culture—what is generally known as “setting the tone at the top”—employees should communicate frequently and every employee should be aware of his role in the company’s risk management efforts. When compared with the three lines of defense strategy, a risk management culture based on ERM would consider all employees part of the first line of defense.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-164">Recall from Chapter 1 that, when implementing a risk management culture, management must first communicate the company’s risk appetite and risk tolerance. Employees in various functional areas can contribute to the company’s goals by understanding how the company views and manages risks, as well as how each function helps achieve the company’s objectives.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-165">Knowledgeable employees have the expertise to spot seemingly small irregularities or unusual occurrences that may be an indicator of underlying issues. For example, employees can</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-12">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-63">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-166">Analyze work processes and suggest improvements to increase productivity and reduce duplicated or wasted efforts</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-64">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-167">Detect irregularities in records related to transactions with customers or vendors and report incidents that suggest fraud or unnecessary expenditures</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-65">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-168">Apply a team-oriented, cooperative approach to improve work processes and procedures</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-169">Regardless of specific job duties, a company’s employees can work together across functional lines to manage risk, with the guidance of the established governance structure, risk taxonomy, and clearly defined roles within the three lines of defense.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-71">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-10">Strategic Risk Management</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-170">The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 illustrated the weaknesses inherent to a largely reactive risk management approach. A company with an effective ERM system proactively aligns its strategic goals with risks, seeking to optimize its risk-adjusted returns. Characteristics of strategic risk management include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-13">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-66">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-171">Incorporating risk into all decision making</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-67">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-172">Taking a long-term view of the company’s risk profile</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-68">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-173">Adopting a risk-adjusted financial measurement system, particularly in the area of incentive compensation</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-69">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-174">Exploiting risks that have the potential to create competitive advantages</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-175">Strategic risk management requires a broad perspective that considers more than the most immediate potential risks. For example, a company that follows regulations and economic patterns in other countries is better positioned to anticipate and exploit risks that may arise due to the interconnected nature of the global economy.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-72">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-11">Risk Control Process</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-176">The risk control process is especially important to ERM because it includes the steps necessary to limit a company’s risk exposures. A risk control process gathers information and then evaluates, monitors, and limits risk. Although the exact process varies by company, the typical steps in the process include:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-14">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-70">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-177"><strong>Identifying risks.</strong> Develop a comprehensive list of risk exposures throughout the organization that could affect its ability to meet objectives, including key risks and emerging risks.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-71">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-178"><strong>Evaluating risks.</strong> Determine the cause, likelihood, and potential severity of each of the identified risks and prioritize according to significance.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-72">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-179"><strong>Treating risks.</strong> Decide which risks qualify for treatment and implement an action plan for each top-priority risk. Action plans can include avoiding, controlling, accepting, transferring, or exploiting risks that exceed defined limits.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-73">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-180"><strong>Monitoring and reviewing risks.</strong> Determine the effectiveness of the risk management process and the strategies implemented through internal controls, such as assessments and internal audits.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-73">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-12">Risk Management Frameworks</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-181">Various authorities have developed risk management frameworks to be used as guides for implementing risk management. For our purposes, a <em>risk management framework</em> is a set of components and principles that supports risk management throughout an organization.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-182">Although developed by recognized authorities, risk management frameworks are voluntary, unless mandated by a governmental agency. When a governmental agency mandates a framework, it becomes a regulation. Companies that voluntarily comply with a framework adhere to best practices and are better prepared to respond to more stringent risk management requirements in the future. Three of the most well-known risk management frameworks are the ORSA ERM framework, the COSO ERM framework, and the ISO 31000 standard.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-74">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch3-h4-4">ORSA ERM Framework</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-183">Recall that each U.S. insurer is required to maintain and continually assess its risk management framework and solvency position in an ORSA Annual Summary Report, which must be signed by the CRO or an equivalent person. Some companies have one or more actuaries dedicated to ORSA; in other companies actuaries work on ORSA in addition to their usual responsibilities.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-184">According to Section 1 of the NAIC <em>ORSA Guidance Manual</em>, an effective risk management framework should incorporate, at a minimum, the following five key principles:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-15">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-74">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-185">Risk culture and governance</p>

</ul>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-75">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch3-h4-5">COSO ERM Framework</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-190">The premise of the COSO ERM framework is that internal controls should help organizations achieve their objectives in the areas of operations, reporting, and compliance. Recently updated in 2017, the COSO ERM framework is now organized into five interrelated components:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-16">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-79">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-191">Governance and culture</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-196">These five components are supported by a set of twenty principles, which describe in further detail the practices that can be used to enhance performance and meet strategic objectives.<span class="ens" id="loma371-ch3-span-34"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma371-ch3-en3" epub:type="noteref" id="loma371-ch3-span-35" role="doc-noteref">3</span> </span></p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-76">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch3-h4-6">ISO 31000 Standard</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-197">ISO 31000 was published in 2009 as an international standard for the implementation of risk management principles. Recently updated in 2018, it lists eight principles of risk management believed to be crucial for a company to successfully manage its risk exposures. The risk management framework should be</p>

</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-206">Most of the widely recognized frameworks, including the ISO 31000 standard and the COSO ERM framework, contain similar approaches to managing risk, although there are some key differences. For example, ORSA requires each insurer to evaluate its risk management framework on an annual basis, whereas neither the COSO ERM framework nor the ISO 31000 standard contains such a requirement (each is voluntary). Each insurer selects a risk management framework that best fits its strategic objectives and individual risk exposures.<span class="ens" id="loma371-ch3-span-36"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma371-ch3-en4" epub:type="noteref" id="loma371-ch3-span-37" role="doc-noteref">4</span> </span></p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-77">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-13">Catastrophic Event Management</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-207">Whereas risk control focuses on everyday risk-taking, catastrophic event management addresses extreme risks that materialize only rarely—but can result in solvency issues for companies. Examples of catastrophic events include acts of terrorism, such as the events of September 11, 2001; economic downturns, such as the financial crisis of 2008; natural disasters, such as the Japanese tsunami of 2011; and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-208">One of the greatest challenges with catastrophic event management is that low-frequency, high-severity events are often unpredictable and more difficult to understand, leaving companies unable to prepare for them. Instead, the company must attempt to envision various extreme scenarios and the response it would take to each. Financial models can stress test the extreme scenarios and determine the potential impact an event could have on the company.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-209">Insurers develop contingency plans with detailed actions the company would take should one of the catastrophic events occur, thereby reducing its overall impact on the company. For example, employee feedback may help a company prioritize which systems would be most critical to restore first should a natural disaster shut down or destroy the company’s computers. Typically, insurers seek reinsurance to reduce the impact of extreme events.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-210">Other contingency plans insurers may use to prepare for catastrophic events are</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-18">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-92">
