<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma371-ch3-h2-4">Basic Risk Management Strategies</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-38">Recall from Chapter 1 that <em>risk management</em> is the process of systematically identifying, assessing, and minimizing the negative impact of risk. Because the effects of an unexpected financial loss can be severe, individuals and businesses usually seek to limit their exposure to risk whenever possible, especially if the risk severity exceeds the likely expected gain. Whether explicitly or implicitly, most insurers have risk management philosophies and strategies. Insurers generally rely on five basic strategies for managing financial and other risks: (1) avoiding risk, (2) accepting risk, (3) controlling risk, (4) transferring risk, and (5) exploiting risk.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-12">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-1">Avoiding Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-39">The first and perhaps most obvious method of managing risk is simply to avoid it altogether. Avoiding risk involves taking actions to eliminate a person’s or company’s exposure to risk. Avoidance is a good strategy for risks that are likely to have a large impact or cause large losses. Insurance companies can avoid some product risks by rejecting applications for life insurance if the proposed insured does not meet insurability standards. Another way insurers can avoid certain risks is by including provisions in their policies that restrict payment of benefits in specified situations; depending on the conditions of the provision, this is also a form of controlling risk.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-13">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-40">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-14">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-41">Blocksmith Insurance receives an application for a life insurance policy. When processing the application and determining the proposed insured’s level of risk, Blocksmith discovers the proposed insured has recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. In accordance with company insurability standards, Blocksmith rejects the application for life insurance and does not issue the policy, thus, avoiding the risk.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-42">Unfortunately, neither individuals nor insurance companies can avoid all risks. Because insurance companies are in the business of taking on risk, avoiding risk is not always a practical risk management strategy. Insurers can, however, control the negative effects of those risks by taking steps to reduce their potential losses.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-15">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-2">Accepting Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-43">Another strategy to manage risk is to accept, or <em>retain</em>, risk. To accept a risk is to recognize the existence of the risk and accept financial responsibility for that risk. The company or individual may still mitigate the potential losses from the risk by controlling or transferring the risk, but some or all of the financial responsibility remains with the party who accepted the risk.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-16">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-44">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-17">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-45">Blocksmith’s underwriters determine that a recent application for insurance meets the company’s insurability standards. Blocksmith approves the application and issues a policy, thus, accepting the risk.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-46">Note that simply choosing to ignore the existence of a risk is not risk acceptance. Risk acceptance requires recognition of a risk and the explicit choice not to avoid, control, transfer, or exploit it.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-18">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-3">Controlling Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-47">Controlling, or <em>mitigating</em>, risk is the most commonly used risk management strategy. This strategy involves taking steps to reduce potential losses that may result from a given risk exposure. For example, insurers can reduce their overall losses on high-risk products by redesigning products.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-19">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-48">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-20">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-49">During the economic downturn of 2008, many insurers that issued a substantial amount of variable annuities (VAs) with secondary guarantees incurred losses on these products. As a result, insurers redesigned these products to minimize potential losses in the future. Newer-generation VAs often come with higher charges and more restrictive guarantees.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-50">Another way that insurers control risk is through their underwriting guidelines.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-21">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-51">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-22">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-52">Like most life insurers, Blocksmith Insurance classifies proposed insureds according to the risk they present to the company. If an applicant represents a higher-than-average risk, Blocksmith can accept the risk but minimize its effect by charging the applicant a higher premium rate than it would charge a similar applicant who represents an average or a lower-than-average risk.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-53">Many aspects of product development are influenced by the need to control risk. See the following table for examples of low-risk and high-risk elements that can be associated with a product.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-4">Transferring Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-68">Another method of managing risk is to transfer it. Transferring risk involves shifting the financial responsibility associated with that risk to another party, usually through financial products that involve a fee for the transfer. The most common way for most individuals and businesses to transfer risk is to purchase insurance coverage.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-69">Insurers also transfer their risk under insurance and annuity contracts by purchasing reinsurance<em>. </em>Recall from Chapter 1 that <em>reinsurance</em> is insurance that one insurance company—known as the <em>direct writer</em>—purchases from another insurance company—known as the <em>reinsurer</em>—to transfer all or part of the risk on insurance policies that the direct writer issued.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-24">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-70">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-25">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-71">Blocksmith decides to purchase reinsurance to cover part of the death benefit payouts for a block of life insurance policies. In this case, Blocksmith is transferring part of its risk on this block to the reinsurer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-72">When an insurer transfers risk through reinsurance, the insurer does not necessarily avoid all exposure to risk. In such cases, the direct writer must accept the risk that the reinsurer will fail to perform its part of the agreement.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-73">Note that when an insurer uses reinsurance to transfer part of the risk on a life insurance policy or annuity contract, the insurer is also <em>controlling </em>its risk exposure by sharing part of the contract’s liability. In other words, controlling risk and transferring risk are not always mutually exclusive events. Similarly, if the insurer does not transfer all of the risk on a policy or contract, the insurer is accepting any risk that remains.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-26">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-74">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-27">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-75">Insurers that use surrender charges are both controlling and transferring risk. For example, by imposing a surrender charge for the first several years of a deferred annuity contract, an insurer attempts to control its exposure to early terminations by transferring some of the risk associated with a surrender back to the contract owner.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-28">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-5">Exploiting Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-76">A final way that insurers can manage risk is to exploit it—in other words, take advantage of an opportunity presented by a risk. For example, an insurer may possess a competitive advantage that allows it to develop a new product that satisfies a customer need. Exploiting risk, like accepting risk, does not mitigate the potential losses from a risk; rather, it increases the possibility of gain from the risk. In exploiting a risk, an insurer must be confident the potential losses are an acceptable hazard in light of the potential gains. Like other basic risk management strategies, exploiting risk is not an exclusive strategy—when deciding to exploit a risk, an insurer typically chooses to control the risk in addition, just as the insurer would for other risks it has accepted.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch3-div-29">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch3-p-77">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch3-div-30">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-78">A few years ago, insurers realized that Baby Boomers who were approaching retirement were concerned about their longevity risk. Some insurers with expertise in assessing longevity risk were able to develop new products—such as annuities with long-term care insurance riders—to help these customers. Because of their unique expertise, these insurers were able to exploit a risk known as <em>new product risk</em>, which we’ll discuss more in a later chapter.</p>
