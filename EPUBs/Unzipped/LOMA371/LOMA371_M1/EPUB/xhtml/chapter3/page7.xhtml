<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma371-ch3-h2-8">Measuring and Managing Expense Risk</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-311">In addition to ERM and ALM, insurers take specific steps to manage risks associated with their expenses. Three approaches that insurers use to manage their expenses are</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-26">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-127">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-312"><strong>Making major expense reductions</strong>, which involve eliminating or drastically reducing expenses in certain areas. Eliminating staff positions, selling certain lines of business, or closing selected field offices are examples of major expense reductions. Although major expense reductions can be effective, insurers often use them selectively rather than across the board. Some expenses, such as promotions for newly introduced products, may need to increase rather than decrease, at least over the short term. For example, an insurer may need to increase its IT budget in order to implement a new automated system that will reduce expenses in the long run.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-128">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-313"><strong>Making minor expense reductions</strong>, which involve finding more efficient ways to perform certain functions. For example, an insurer can often reduce contract maintenance costs by processing routine transactions on the company’s website rather than routing them to customer service representatives. Outsourcing and benchmarking, which we discuss later in this section, are practices commonly used to reduce operating expenses.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-129">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-314"><strong>Reallocating corporate expenses</strong>, which involve separating expenses that are related to the total company from expenses related to particular products or lines of business. By allocating to a product line only those expenses that are directly related to the product line, an insurer can more easily identify where resources should be directed.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-16">Eliminating Expenses</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-315">One way to eliminate expenses is through rightsizing. <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-rightsizing" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch3-span-68" role="doc-glossref">Rightsizing</span>, also known as <em>downsizing</em>, is the elimination of nonessential jobs within an organization. To be successful, rightsizing must be accompanied by careful redesign of work processes to determine the number and types of employee positions that are essential for effective business operations. Some rightsizing can be achieved through <em>attrition</em>, which occurs when a company purposefully elects to not replace employees who leave their jobs because of retirement, resignation, death, or disability. Additional methods that companies can use to eliminate employee positions include early retirement programs, closing regional offices, and layoffs.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-117">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma371-ch3-h3-17">Reducing Expenses</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-316">Companies must pay for information systems, accounting services, salaries for home office employees, and various other expenses. Insurers can attempt to reduce these and other administrative expenses by outsourcing certain functions and using benchmarking.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-118">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch3-h4-9">Outsourcing Certain Functions</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-317"><span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-outsourcing" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch3-span-69" role="doc-glossref">Outsourcing </span>is the practice of hiring an external vendor to perform specified operations or functions. An outsourcing arrangement may cover all or only part of the functions for an area. For example, an insurance company might outsource its entire claim administration operation, or it might outsource only claim investigation and perform all other claim administration processes in-house. Functions that life insurance companies commonly outsource include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-27">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-130">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-318">Information management functions</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-131">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-319">Investment management functions</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-132">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-320">Life insurance claim administration functions, such as claim investigation and claim processing</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-133">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-321">Customer service functions, such as call center operations and premium billing and collection</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-134">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-322">Human resources functions, such as payroll and benefits processing</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-323">Often, vendors can perform certain jobs at a lower cost to the insurer than can the insurer’s employees. Before deciding whether to outsource a particular function, an insurer evaluates the expected benefits and drawbacks associated with outsourcing that function. The insurer generally considers the following factors:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch3-ul-28">
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-135">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-324"><strong>The insurer’s own ability to perform the function efficiently and effectively. </strong>External vendors tend to specialize in certain business functions, and their expertise often allows them to perform these functions faster, better, and less expensively than can the insurer. For example, an information management vendor might offer faster turnaround on data processing than the insurer can achieve with its own resources. Further, the vendor may have a workforce in a location where salaries are less costly than in the insurer’s location.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-136">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-325"><strong>The importance of immediate implementation. </strong>An insurer that does not have an infrastructure established for a particular function may need to delay starting the function until it can hire and train personnel and establish information systems and procedures. If timing is critical, outsourcing the function to an external vendor that already has the necessary human resources, technology, and procedures in place can minimize delays and reduce costs.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-137">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-326"><strong>The availability of start-up capital. </strong>The start-up costs associated with new operations are often substantial. For example, the high upfront costs of purchasing necessary technology and hiring and training personnel for a new call center can create a strain on capital. An insurer can relieve this strain by outsourcing capital-intensive functions to external vendors.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-138">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-327"><strong>The importance of control over the operation. </strong>When an insurer outsources a function, it relinquishes some control over the day-to-day performance of that function. Before outsourcing it, the insurer should weigh this loss of control and potential privacy risk against the savings in time and money offered by outsourcing. If maintaining control over a function is a priority, outsourcing may not be an effective alternative even if it reduces costs.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch3-div-119">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch3-h4-10">Benchmarking</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch3-p-328">One of the most popular ways to manage operating expenses and improve operating efficiency is to benchmark company operations. <em>Benchmarking</em> consists of (1) identifying the best outcomes that other companies have achieved for a specific activity or process and the practices that produced those outcomes and (2) implementing the best practices to equal or surpass the best outcomes. In effect, benchmarking allows companies to improve operations without reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-329">Insurers frequently use benchmarking to improve the efficiency of their</p>

	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-330">Employee training and development programs</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch3-li-140">
	<p id="loma371-ch3-p-331">Document management processes</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch3-p-373">These results indicate that Steadfast is exceeding the expense benchmark by $35 per policy. In addition, results show that the areas that most need improvement are agency operating expenses (+$20) and home office costs (+$15). By modifying its current practices to match the practices that produced the benchmarked amounts, Steadfast should be able to reduce costs in these key areas.</p>
