<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-221">As we have mentioned, insurance company solvency is directly linked to a company’s ability to manage the risks associated with its investments, pricing, business, and operations. Each company may categorize and name risks differently, so you may know some of these risks by another name.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch2-h3-6">Investment Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-222">Any time a company invests its funds with an expectation of earning a profit, the company is taking an investment risk. From an insurer’s perspective, an <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-investmentrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-82" role="doc-glossref">investment risk</span> is the possibility that an investment may fail to generate some or all of an expected profit or that the insurer will lose all or part of the original investment. All investing activities involve some element of risk. The types of investment risk that have the greatest priority for life insurers are credit risk and market risk.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch2-div-123">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch2-h4-17">Credit Risk</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-223">Because insurers hold a large amount of debt securities in their general accounts, credit risk exposures are one of the main threats for insurer portfolios. <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-creditrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-83" role="doc-glossref">Credit risk</span> is the risk that (1) a borrower defaults on debt obligations by failing to make payments of principal or interest on time, or (2) a lender sustains a financial loss based on an adverse change in a borrower’s creditworthiness. These two categories of credit risk are also known as <em>default risk</em> and <em>downgrade risk</em>:</p>

Default risk affects all types of debt securities and also affects corporate equity securities, which lose substantial market value if the issuing company defaults on its debt obligations and becomes insolvent.</p>

A credit downgrade does not affect payments of principal or interest to investors. However, market value decreases usually accompany downgrades. Thus, if an investor must sell a downgraded security before maturity, the amount of money raised by the sale will be lower than it would have been prior to the downgrade.</p>

</ul>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-126">

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-229">Blocksmith Insurance owns a bond issued by Camion Corporation. Camion receives a reduction in its credit rating—a rating downgrade. As a result, investors perceive bonds issued by Camion to be riskier and less valuable than before the downgrade. If Blocksmith sells its Camion bond, it will receive less money than it would have if it sold the bond before Camion was downgraded. Thus, Camion’s rating downgrade reduced the value of Blocksmith’s bond investment.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-230">The main threat of credit risk is that, when an investment goes into default or is downgraded, its market value also decreases. Typically, defaults cause larger market value drops than downgrades.</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch2-h4-18">Market Risk</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-231">Another investment risk<span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-marketrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-86" role="doc-glossref">, market risk</span>,<strong> </strong>is the risk of losses or reduced investment returns caused by movements in overall market conditions or in a specific sector of the market. Market risk can take many forms, including equity risk, inflation risk, interest-rate risk, reinvestment-rate risk, currency risk, foreign investment risk, and liquidity risk.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-232"><span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-equityrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-87" role="doc-glossref">Equity risk </span>is the risk of a loss arising from movements in the direction of the stock, or equity, markets. The market price of shares varies depending on demand and supply, among other factors.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-129">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch2-p-233">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch2-div-130">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-234">Blocksmith Insurance, like most insurers, doesn’t invest heavily in the stock market, but it does have some stock investments. As a result, Blocksmith is exposed to equity risk when market conditions change. Because Blocksmith limits the amount of stock it owns, however, it also limits its exposure to equity risk.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-235"><span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-inflationrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-88" role="doc-glossref">Inflation risk </span>is the risk that the price of goods and services will increase over time, causing a decline in the value of investments and returns. During periods of inflation, market interest rates and the cost of most goods and services increase. For insurers, those increases have a direct impact on the profitability of their fixed-rate products, such as fixed cash value life insurance and fixed deferred annuity products.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-236">The value of an investment return is affected by the value of money. Over time, inflation erodes the value of money, also known as money’s <em>purchasing power</em>. The presence of inflation requires an investor to earn a rate of return greater than or equal to the expected inflation rate in order to avoid losing purchasing power.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-131">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch2-p-237">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch2-div-132">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-238">Blocksmith Insurance owns a bond with a fixed interest rate of four percent. During the period that Blocksmith owns the bond, the inflation rate increases to five percent, causing the prices of goods and services to rise. In addition, the rate of price increases is higher than the rate that Blocksmith is earning in bond interest. As a result, goods and services are becoming more expensive for Blocksmith, but the amount of bond interest that Blocksmith receives is not keeping pace. In other words, because of rising inflation, the purchasing power of the bond’s interest payments is declining.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-239"><em>Interest-rate risk</em>, a contingency risk we described earlier, is the risk that unpredictable movements in market interest rates will cause the value of an investment to change. An insurer’s assets can lose value or its liabilities can gain value as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-240">The market values of existing interest-bearing investments generally have an inverse relationship with market interest rates. Thus, for interest-bearing investments—such as bonds and mortgage loans—the market value of an existing investment will</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-243">Changes in interest rates have a significant impact on insurers because the majority of their investments are fixed income products, such as bonds. For instance, in rising interest-rate environments, existing bonds typically fall in market value because new bonds offer higher interest rates, which are more attractive to investors. In such cases, an investor can hold existing bonds to maturity, thus avoiding selling them at unfavorable market values. Life insurance companies generally purchase bonds and other debt securities with the intention of holding them to maturity. Investments in mortgages and other fixed-rate investments are also subject to interest-rate risk.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-133">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch2-p-244">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch2-div-134">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-245">Blocksmith Insurance owns a block of commercial mortgage loans. When Blocksmith purchased the mortgages, they paid the same interest rate as the market interest rate, which was four percent. The market interest rate is now five percent. Because Blocksmith is still earning four percent interest on its mortgages, the value of its investment has decreased. If Blocksmith sells the mortgages, it will need to discount the price to make them attractive to potential buyers.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-246"><span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-reinvestmentraterisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-89" role="doc-glossref">Reinvestment-rate risk </span>is the risk that a change in interest rates will lead to lower income when owners reinvest their funds. It refers to the possibility that owners will have to reinvest funds at a lower rate of return than the investment originally earned.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-247">Insurers’ bond investments are susceptible to reinvestment-rate risk. When bonds mature and insurers reinvest their funds, they must invest at the current rates. If those rates are lower than the original rates, the insurer will earn a lower rate on its funds. The same is true for bonds that can be repaid before their maturity date.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-135">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch2-p-248">EXAMPLE</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-249">Five years ago, when Blocksmith Insurance purchased a series of callable bonds issued by the Noblock Corporation, the market interest rate was five percent. The bonds, which also paid an interest rate of five percent, had a 10-year maturity date. However, after six years, Noblock called, or repaid, the bonds. At the time of the bond call, the market interest rate had fallen to three percent. When Blocksmith reinvested its funds from the call into bonds also paying a three percent interest rate, it wasn’t able to earn as much in interest payments as it had previously, when its bonds paid five percent.</p>

Insurers that operate in more than one country or that invest in securities that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to currency risk.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-251">When one currency falls in relation to another, the falling currency loses relative value and the rising currency gains relative value. Generally, currency risk can arise from geopolitical factors, fluctuations in the supply and demand of a country’s manufactured goods, inflation, and changes in government leadership.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-253">Although Blocksmith Insurance currently operates only in the United States, it plans to open offices in China in the next year. Blocksmith’s overseas operations will likely expose the company to currency risk. To set up its offices, Blocksmith will need to convert U.S. dollars into Chinese yuan. If, between the planning period and the conversion date, the value of the yuan rises relative to the value of the dollar, then the amount of dollars that Blocksmith set aside will not purchase as much in China as was thought during planning. In effect, because of the weaker dollar, Blocksmith will end up paying more in dollars to rent offices and hire staff in China than it originally planned.</p>

This risk can arise from a lack of buyers, lack of secondary markets, or the structure of the investment. Liquidity risk is important to insurers because they must have enough cash and liquid assets on hand at all times to pay their policy benefits as they come due. If a company’s cash and liquid assets are not sufficient to cover these financial obligations, the company could be forced to sell long-term assets to meet its current needs or borrow cash on unfavorable terms, which could threaten its solvency.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch2-h3-7">Pricing Risk</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-260">In addition to the operational and business risks that all companies face, insurers face risks that are unique to the insurance business. One of the most important of these is <em>pricing risk</em>, a contingency risk we described earlier in this chapter.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-261">For insurers, pricing is complicated because the amount and timing of many of the costs associated with insurance products are unknown. For example, when an insurer designs a life insurance product, it can only estimate how much in benefits it will have to pay in a given year. If more insureds die than the company anticipated, it will have to pay more in death benefits than it planned. If differences are great enough, the company may even lose money on the product.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-262">In addition, insurers manage <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-underwritingrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-93" role="doc-glossref">underwriting risk</span>, which is the specific risk that insurers assume through the insurance and annuity contracts they underwrite. Underwriters must follow the insurer’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-underwritingphilosophy" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-94" role="doc-glossref">underwriting philosophy</span>, a set of objectives that guides all of an insurer’s underwriting actions when selecting risks. If underwriters select risks outside of the parameters designated during pricing, the product may not meet profitability goals.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch2-div-144">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch2-h4-19"><strong>Mortality Risk</strong></h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-263">One of the most significant pricing risks for life insurers is <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-mortalityrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-95" role="doc-glossref">mortality risk</span>, which is the risk that actual mortality—the incidence of death in a specified group of people—will differ from expectations. For life insurance, mortality risk is the likelihood that a person will die sooner than statistically expected; for annuities, it is the likelihood that a person will live longer than statistically expected.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-264">Recall from Chapter 1 that actuaries are responsible for performing experience analysis. Actuaries typically review the mortality experience data associated with a new product at the end of a specified period to compare actual mortality rates and assumed mortality rates. This evaluation is important because differences can affect company reserves and its results on the balance sheet and income statement. The evaluation may also affect future products and services.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-145">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch2-p-265">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch2-div-146">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-266">Blocksmith Insurance released a new term life product four years ago. The product’s profits were lower than anticipated; therefore, Blocksmith’s actuaries performed experience analysis on the product to see if the actual experience corresponded with the assumptions they previously made. The actuaries found that actual mortality rates were higher than the model’s assumptions. Since the actual mortality rates were higher than the expected mortality rates of the new product, Blocksmith failed to make an adequate amount of profit on this product.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch2-div-147">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch2-h4-20">Expense Risk</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-267">Another significant pricing risk insurers face is <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-expenserisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-96" role="doc-glossref">expense risk</span>, which is the risk that actual expenses will differ from the amounts assumed during product design. The company estimates its operating expenses, such as salaries, agent compensation, rent, and legal fees, in an <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-expensebudget" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-97" role="doc-glossref">expense budget</span>, which is a financial plan of action that identifies the types and amounts of expenses a company expects to incur during an accounting period.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-268">Most of the information insurers use to estimate product expenses comes from the company’s past experience data. However, due to changes in economic and business conditions, a company’s actual experience can differ from its expected experience. Like an unexpectedly high mortality rate for life insurance products, unexpectedly high expenses can lead to lower profits and could even create losses.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch2-div-148">
<p class="example-header" id="loma371-ch2-p-269">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch2-div-149">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-270">In designing a new annuity product, Blocksmith Insurance used assumptions for expenses that turned out to be much lower than the expenses it experienced in supporting the product. As a result, Blocksmith ended up losing money on the product.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-271">An insurer builds its operating expenses into product design so that these expenses are passed along in the form of charges to customers. The amount charged to cover each policy’s share of the expenses of operation is called <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-expenseloading" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-98" role="doc-glossref">expense loading</span>. Expense loading is a cost area that can vary from company to company based on its operations and efficiency.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-272">An insurance company’s operating expenses affect not only product design, but also the company’s competitive position in the marketplace. Through careful expense management, an insurer can reduce its operating expenses, thereby requiring less expense loading. In this way, the insurer improves its operational efficiency and its competitive position.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch2-div-150">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch2-h4-21">Policyholder Behavior Risk</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-273"><span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-policyholderbehaviorrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-99" role="doc-glossref">Policyholder behavior risk</span>, or <em>customer behavior risk</em>, is the risk that policyholder actions or decisions will adversely affect product performance. This risk is especially high for actions or behaviors that affect product persistency. Although life insurance and annuity products are typically intended to stay in force for a relatively long time before benefits become payable, customers sometimes stop paying premiums, causing a <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-lapse" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-100" role="doc-glossref">lapse</span>—termination due to nonpayment of premiums—of their policies. Other customers may decide to surrender their policies. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-surrender" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-101" role="doc-glossref">surrender </span>occurs when the owner of a cash value life insurance policy or a deferred annuity chooses to receive the contract’s monetary value before the contract matures.

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-277">Due to an economic downturn, Blocksmith Insurance’s new product did not perform as well as Blocksmith had anticipated. The actual amount of policyholder lapses and surrenders for the new product was higher than was assumed when the policy was designed, which led to a loss on the product.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-278">Insurers can often reduce the negative effects of policyholder behaviors, such as excessive lapses and surrenders, by adding margins, or extra amounts, to the expense amounts in their product designs. Margins provide a cushion in case actual expenses caused by policyholder behavior exceed assumed expenses. Insurers can also reduce the impact of excess lapses and surrenders by assessing surrender charges on lapses or surrenders that occur during the early years of certain policies, or by implementing customer retention programs to reduce overall lapse rates. We will discuss how operating expenses and policyholder behavior expenses are incorporated into product design in Chapter 9.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-279">A type of policyholder behavior risk that insurers face is <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-antiselectionrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-102" role="doc-glossref">antiselection risk</span>, also called <em>adverse selection risk</em>, which is the risk of loss or adverse product performance due to the tendency of individuals who believe they have a greater-than-average likelihood of loss to seek insurance protection to a greater extent than do those who believe they have an average or a less-than-average likelihood of loss. Insurers manage antiselection risk by ensuring that underwriters assess each risk carefully and by including provisions such as the incontestability provision in their policies.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-280">A risk category common to companies in all industries is <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-businessrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-103" role="doc-glossref">business risk</span>, which is the risk that changes in a company’s external environment will affect its operations. Business risks include regulatory risk, competition risk, event risk, and geopolitical risk. Some companies also recognize <em>industry risk</em>, which focuses on changes in the external environment specifically shared by companies in the same industry.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-281"><span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-regulatoryrisk" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch2-span-104" role="doc-glossref">Regulatory risk </span>is the risk created by changes in the regulatory environment. Regulatory risk includes the risk of loss associated with non-compliance with laws, rules, or regulations. In addition to complying with current laws and regulations, insurers must keep up with constant regulatory changes, as oversight of the insurance industry continues to receive heightened scrutiny. These constant changes can negatively affect company performance. For example, insurers often devote substantial resources to prepare for new laws and regulations. These efforts can place a huge strain on a company and can even threaten its solvency.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch2-p-283">As a result of the NAIC’s <em>Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act</em>, large and medium insurers in the United States are now required to regularly perform an ORSA and file a confidential ORSA Summary Report with regulators. Complying with this new law takes time and resources, including staff, technology, and in some cases, consultants, as insurers attempt to make improvements to their ERM frameworks to comply with ORSA.</p>

Occasionally, companies may face events that unexpectedly affect their ability to continue business operations or to meet debt obligations. A common example is a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, or fire. Other examples include hostile takeovers and terrorist attacks.</p>

Blocksmith needed to use some of its surplus to pay claims during this time, which over time could threaten the company’s solvency.</p>

These risks can arise in any operational area of the company, including marketing, product development, claim administration, information technology, underwriting, and customer service. Operational risk is challenging because one situation can pose multiple risks to multiple operational areas. The types of operational risk we will discuss are strategy risk, distribution risk, reputation risk, human resources risk, business process risk, cyber risk, and fraud risk.</p>

The loss can be a result of an inefficient or ineffective business process or can be a result of a company’s failure to adhere to a business process. Both inefficient and ineffective processes result in higher costs, longer service times, and increased quality errors. Because business processes are internal factors controllable by the company, business process risk is distinct from other types of risk that may involve factors that are external to the insurer.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch2-p-308">Most processes are part of a company’s day-to-day business operations and are in place to ensure that company goals are met and procedures followed.
