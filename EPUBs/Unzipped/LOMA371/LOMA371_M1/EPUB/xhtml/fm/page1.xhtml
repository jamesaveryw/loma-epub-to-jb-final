<p class="ocp" id="loma371-fm-p-1">ONLINE COURSE PORTAL</p>

<p id="loma371-fm-p-2">The LOMA 371 Course Portal, available online at www.loma.org via your “Upcoming Learning” page, includes numerous multimedia features designed to reinforce and enhance your learning experience and help you prepare for the exam. Among these features are this text in an interactive e-book format, interactive Practice Questions and a Sample Exam with answer feedback. If you are not already using the online Course Portal but would like access to the many additional study resources for this course, please follow the log-in instructions provided in your Enrollment Confirmation e-mail, or call 1-800-ASK-LOMA or email <a href="mailto:education@loma.org" id="loma371-fm-a-1">education@loma.org</a> for assistance.</p>

<p id="loma371-fm-p-3"><strong>LOMA (Life Office Management Association, Inc.) </strong>is an international association founded in 1924. LOMA is committed to a business partnership with the worldwide members in the insurance and financial services industry to improve their management and operations through quality employee development, research, information sharing, and related products and services. Among LOMA’s activities is the sponsorship of several self-study education programs leading to professional designations, including the Fellow, Life Management Institute (FLMI) program. For more information on all of LOMA’s education programs, please visit <a href="http://www.loma.org" id="loma371-fm-a-2">www.loma.org</a>.</p>

<p class="sop" id="loma371-fm-p-4">Statement of Purpose: LOMA Educational Programs Testing and Designations.</p>

<p class="footer-fresh" id="loma371-fm-p-5">Examinations described in the LOMA Education and Training Catalog are designed solely to measure whether students have successfully completed the relevant assigned curriculum, and the attainment of the FLMI and other LOMA designations indicates only that all examinations in the given curriculum have been successfully completed. In no way shall a student’s completion of a given LOMA course or attainment of the FLMI or other LOMA designation be construed to mean that LOMA in any way certifies that student’s competence, training, or ability to perform any given task. LOMA’s examinations are to be used solely for general educational purposes, and no other use of the examinations or programs is authorized or intended by LOMA. Furthermore, it is in no way the intention of the LOMA staff to describe the standard of appropriate conduct in any field of the insurance and financial services industry, and LOMA expressly repudiates any attempt to so use the curriculum and examinations. Any such assessment of student competence or industry standards of conduct should instead be based on independent professional inquiry and the advice of competent professional counsel.</p>
