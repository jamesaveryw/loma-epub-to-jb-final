<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-111">The basic concepts of risk management are fairly straightforward, but the practice of risk management is much more complicated. Calculating the probabilities of profit and loss for even a single life insurance product is an exacting, multilayered task. Tracking and analyzing all the product lines and investments for a company is many times more challenging. Thus, actuaries play a critical role in the success of a life insurance company. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-actuary" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-46" role="doc-glossref">actuary</span> is a technical expert in insurance, annuities, and financial instruments who applies mathematical knowledge to industry and company statistics to calculate various financial values. While mathematical expertise is key, an actuary must also possess strong business acumen and technical knowledge of products.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-112">An actuary’s work involves generating financial models for the company. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-financialmodel" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-47" role="doc-glossref">financial model</span> is a computer-based mathematical model that approximates the operation of real-world financial processes. Actuaries working for insurers create financial models that use assumptions for product sales, policy lapses, shifts in interest rates, changes in mortality and morbidity rates, and so on. <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-actuarialassumptions" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-48" role="doc-glossref">Actuarial assumptions</span> are estimated values used in financial modeling, typically for the purposes of risk management or technical product design. Actuaries also help senior management understand risks as clearly and accurately as possible, thereby providing actionable information so that the company can make informed decisions about the products it sells and services. Actuarial advice must be as objective as possible, so that a company can react to the scenarios that are most likely to take place, rather than the scenarios that the company would like to see take place.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-113">Actuaries work with a variety of departments within the company, such as finance, sales and marketing, and claims and underwriting. Some actuaries occupy specialized positions, such as focusing on a specific product line, while others are responsible for tasks across different company functions. A notable aspect of actuarial work is the effort to anticipate circumstances beyond the company’s control by modeling unexpected outcomes and their impacts. While nobody can project changes due to external forces with 100 percent accuracy, well-constructed financial models provide more accurate estimations of the probability and impact of such changes. Overall, the actuarial function of calculating probable risks and returns is vital to both risk management and technical product design. The insight below discusses how an insurer might organize its actuarial function.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-116">The organization of the actuarial function varies widely by company. For example, one insurer may organize its actuarial teams by market segment, while another focuses on distribution channel, and a third keeps all actuarial services under a central actuarial department. A company’s actuarial function might be organized by</p>

</ul>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-117">In addition, actuarial units have different reporting relationships from one company to the next. For example, in one company, the actuaries on a line of business might report to the head of the line of business; in another company, they might report directly to the head of the actuarial department. Small companies may employ actuaries who hold multiple distinct responsibilities in different functions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-118">Thanks to advances in technology, an insurer is able to collect and analyze an increasingly vast amount of information to help it better understand its customers’ needs and preferences. <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-bigdata" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-49" role="doc-glossref">Big data</span> is a large amount of information gathered from various sources, in various formats, and at a rapid speed. To analyze the ever-increasing volume of big data, insurers are increasingly hiring data scientists as well as actuaries. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-datascientist" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-50" role="doc-glossref">data scientist</span> is an individual who uses techniques from statistics and computer programming to (1) identify patterns and trends in data and (2) create mathematical models that forecast business outcomes. Some insurers also expect their current or potential actuaries to expand their role to include data scientist functions. The data scientist’s role is similar to the actuary’s, but has a different focus. Figure 1.3 illustrates some general differences between actuaries and data scientists.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch1-h3-2">The Actuarial Control Cycle</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-120">Actuarial functions generally involve applying the actuarial control cycle to a specific discipline or problem. In general terms, a <em>control cycle</em> is a repetitive process designed to ensure that all areas of a company adhere to the company’s performance standards. The <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-actuarialcontrolcycle" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-53" role="doc-glossref">actuarial control cycle</span> generally is expressed as a process of three repeated steps:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch1-ul-9">
	<li id="loma371-ch1-li-40">
	<p id="loma371-ch1-p-121">Define the need</p>
	</li>

	<li id="loma371-ch1-li-42">
	<p id="loma371-ch1-p-123">Monitor the results</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-124">New product development begins with the first two steps: <em>Define the need</em> (or sometimes <em>define the problem</em>), by determining a customer need that is not being satisfied; and <em>design the solution</em>, by creating a product that will serve that customer need. Once the product is on the market, the company can <em>monitor the results</em> to see how the product’s lapse rates, expenses, number of claims, and other variables are performing compared to the assumptions made during technical product design. Monitoring the results is an ongoing step in the process.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-125">The cycle then repeats by defining a new need. This need may be an aspect of the product, such as a difference between the product’s projected interest margin and the actual interest margin, in which case the actuary may design a solution by modifying the product’s interest rates or the assumptions used. In other cases, the new need may be a customer need that is not being satisfied, in which case the company begins work on a new product. Figure 1.4 illustrates this cycle.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-130">The process to become a credentialed actuary involves a mix of university-level courses and actuarial exams. However, the specific requirements for certification can vary greatly by country. For example, the German Actuarial Society requires an actuary to pass more than 13 exams, while actuaries in Sweden receive certification through a program administered by Stockholm University. In the United States, the <em>Society of Actuaries (SOA)</em> administers exams and grants designations for actuaries in the life and health insurance industry, and the <em>Casualty Actuary Society (CAS)</em> administers exams for actuaries in the property and casualty insurance industry.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-131">An entry-level actuary position in the United States may require the applicant to have passed as few as two actuarial exams on the general topics of probability and financial mathematics. Positions with greater responsibilities typically require designations. The SOA’s designations require the actuary to pass a set of actuarial exams on various topics, complete specified courses, and gain credit for validation by education experience (VEE). A VEE credit typically requires a minimum grade in an approved university course on a topic such as economics, or successfully passing a standardized exam. Actuarial exams are very rigorous and demanding, to the point that many insurers offer paid time off to study for employees who are pursuing a designation. The SOA’s designations and their requirements are</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch1-h3-3">Types of Actuaries</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-135">The majority of actuaries work in the insurance industry, either as employees or outside consultants. Some specialize in a specific function, such as creating financial models to manage the company’s investments in stocks and bonds. Others have a variety of responsibilities. For example, an actuary whose primary responsibility is designing insurance products might also contribute his actuarial skills to his company’s ERM initiative.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-136">Although these categories are not mutually exclusive, the following are some of the most common types of actuaries:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch1-ul-11">
	<li id="loma371-ch1-li-46">
	<p id="loma371-ch1-p-137"><em>Insurance actuaries</em> build models and projections to design insurance products. Many insurance actuaries further specialize in specific product lines, such as life insurance, health insurance and healthcare, pensions, long-term care, or property and casualty insurance. Some insurers employ <em>pricing actuaries</em> to work on technical product design and <em>reserving actuaries</em> to analyze and adjust existing blocks of ongoing business.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch1-li-47">
	<p id="loma371-ch1-p-138"><em>Risk actuaries </em>specialize in risk management. Risk actuaries are typically involved in a company’s ERM processes. Companies in many different industries may employ risk actuaries.</p>

	<li id="loma371-ch1-li-48">
	<p id="loma371-ch1-p-139"><em>Appointed actuaries</em>, also called <em>valuation actuaries</em> or <em>qualified actuaries</em>, prepare actuarial reports for insurers and review the assumptions behind proposed products. The designation of appointed actuary has more to do with qualifications than a line of specific work. An actuary must meet qualification standards before he can serve as an appointed actuary; the qualification standards vary by country. In the United States, for instance, the qualification standards are set by the American Academy of Actuaries. An appointed actuary is generally expected to provide impartial advice to a client. Appointed actuaries may be employees of an insurer, or contracted consultants from third-party firms.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch1-h3-4">Actuarial Roles</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-147">While descriptors such as “insurance actuary” or “risk actuary” give a general overview of an actuary’s occupation, an actuary may have many specific responsibilities that go beyond this general classification. For instance, at a smaller company, an insurance actuary may play many different roles in her company: working in technical product design, contributing to her company’s ERM practice, negotiating reinsurance agreements, and so on. At larger insurers, an actuary’s role is likely far more specialized. The following are some of the broadest and most common roles that actuaries fulfill in life insurance companies.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch1-div-76">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-1">Valuation and Financial Reporting</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-148">Actuaries play a role in the process of <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-valuation" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-56" role="doc-glossref">valuation</span>, or calculating the monetary value of a company’s assets, liabilities, and capital for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Valuation examines not only the resources that a company has, but the resources that a company can be expected to need or earn in the future. Actuarial skills such as modeling are therefore critical to arriving at an accurate projection of a company’s future success.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-149">One form of valuation critical to insurance companies is reserve valuation. <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-reservevaluation" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-57" role="doc-glossref">Reserve valuation</span>, or <em>reserving</em>, is the formal actuarial process of establishing a value for an insurer’s contractual reserves. Reserve valuation is necessary both for risk management and for technical product design. For example, establishing a price for a new insurance product requires an accurate valuation of the amount of reserves required for that product based on established internal experience or industry standards.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch1-div-77">
<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch1-div-78">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-150">The process of reserve valuation changed significantly in the United States on January 1, 2020, when <em>principle-based reserving</em>, or <em>PBR</em>, became the mandatory form of reserve valuation in many states. Prior to the adoption of PBR, insurers used a standard reserve requirement, set by the state and applied to all insurance companies. PBR is a more dynamic methodology that evaluates risks on an individual company basis. Because PBR applies to most individual life insurance policies, insurers were required to significantly alter their reserve valuation processes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-151">Valuation is also essential for financial reporting. Because an asset or liability’s value may change over time, an accurate valuation may require calculation based on a number of factors and assumptions. For example, the claims amount that an insurer must pay on a block of policies is affected by lapses and mortality, which can vary significantly from year to year. Therefore, an actuarial calculation is required to determine an appropriate liability for the block of policies.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-152">In recent years, the valuation process has come to rely more heavily on commercial actuarial software, whereas before insurers would often develop their own tools for actuarial functions. Actuaries must therefore remain current on relevant software releases and updates, in addition to their other responsibilities.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch1-div-79">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-2">Technical Product Design</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-153">Actuaries are integral to the process of designing life insurance products. In some companies, this process is also known as <em>pricing</em>; other insurers use the pricing term only to describe the actuarial portions of the process such as setting a premium rate. As we’ll explore further in this text, technical product design requires the calculation of probable outcomes based on a variety of actuarial assumptions and variables. How much premium should the company charge? What happens if interest rates increase, decrease, or are stagnant? Will a life insurance product still be profitable if mortality rates are higher than expected? Will an annuity product still be profitable if longevity rates are higher than expected? Addressing all these variables requires the mathematical, statistical, and computer expertise of an actuary.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-154">By necessity, insurance technical product design must use actuarial assumptions and projections. When a company sells a life insurance policy to a new customer, the company has no way of knowing how much it will cost to pay that customer’s claims, or how many premium payments it will receive from that customer. Therefore, technical product design relies on averages and probabilities. Actuaries extrapolate these figures based on the law of large numbers. The <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-lawoflargenumbers" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-58" role="doc-glossref">law of large numbers</span> is a mathematical concept which states that, under normal circumstances, the more times a particular event is observed, the more likely it is that the observations will approximate the “true” probability that the event will occur. Mortality tables are one example of probabilities determined by the law of large numbers. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-mortalitytable" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-59" role="doc-glossref">mortality table</span> is a statistical table that shows the number of people in a cohort—or group of people—and the number or rate of deaths for the cohort at given ages—that is, how many deaths may be expected at each age. Actuaries build mortality tables by examining demographics on a large scale and recording the average mortality results by age, sex, risk class, and other such factors.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch1-div-80">
<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch1-div-81">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-155">One challenge particular to the life insurance industry is that mortality tables measure the probability of death, and death is an event that happens only once in a person’s life. Therefore, life insurance actuaries work with a more limited set of data than do actuaries in other fields of insurance, such as property and casualty, where events such as accidents may happen many times in a given person’s life.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-156">As with valuation, technology is changing technical product design. Traditionally insurers developed their own internal tools for pricing, but now commercial actuarial software is playing an increasingly large role.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch1-div-82">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-3">Experience Analysis</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-157">A key actuarial responsibility is experience analysis, which involves testing assumptions against past experience. This practice analyzes <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-experiencedata" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-60" role="doc-glossref">experience data</span>, which is internal, proprietary data about the past behavior of certain factors such as mortality rates and expenses. Experience data is maintained in a company’s records or accounting systems. An example of experience data is a company’s sales, premium payment, and lapse records for an insurance product line. By comparing experience data to the assumptions used in the company’s models, actuaries can determine whether the assumptions properly reflect changing conditions. In addition to internal, proprietary data, experience analysis may also involve industry-wide data sources and consultants.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-158">Experience analysis is the foundation of many actuarial tasks. For example, if an insurer can understand its customers’ lapse patterns, the insurer can design products so that actual lapse rates are more likely to meet the insurer’s targeted lapse rates. Some of the possible uses of experience analysis include</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-4">Profitability Testing and Analysis</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-169">Calculating the profitability of a product is fairly straightforward in most industries. The structure of life insurance products, however, alters the nature of this calculation. A company that sells office chairs, for instance, pays most of the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and shipping up front, and then receives the revenue from sales. However, an insurer receives the revenue from sales for a life insurance product <em>before</em> the insurer is required to pay the primary expense of the product—that is, the death benefit amount. Furthermore, at the time of the product’s sale, there is no set date for the claim payment. An insurer may pay the death benefit within one year, twenty years from the policy issue date, or in some cases, not at all. Calculating the profitability of a life insurance product therefore requires both modeling a range of possible outcomes and analyzing historical data in as much detail as possible. We discuss profitability measurement further in Chapter 7.</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-5">Asset-Liability Management</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-170">Actuaries play a key role in the risk management practice known as asset-liability management. In a general sense, asset-liability management is a cross-functional management system that many types of financial institutions use to coordinate the risks that simultaneously affect the company’s investments and products. In an actuarial context, <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-assetliabilitymanagement" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-61" role="doc-glossref">asset-liability management (ALM)</span> is the practice of coordinating the administration of an insurer’s asset portfolio (its investments) with the administration of its liability portfolio (its obligations to customers) so as to achieve the best possible effects. In effect, ALM is a specific form of matching expected risks to expected returns. We discuss the ALM process in more detail in Chapter 3.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch1-div-85">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-6">Enterprise Risk Management</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-171">As noted earlier, many actuaries are also involved in the company-wide practice of enterprise risk management. We discuss ERM in more detail in Chapter 3.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch1-div-86">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-7">Reinsurance</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-172">Actuaries are necessary for negotiating and administering reinsurance agreements. <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-reinsurance" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch1-span-62" role="doc-glossref">Reinsurance</span> is a type of insurance that one insurance company, known as the <em>direct writer</em>, purchases from another insurance company, known as the <em>reinsurer</em>, to transfer all or part of the risk on insurance policies that the direct writer has issued. In other words, the reinsurer becomes liable to pay claims on the policies in question, in exchange for compensation from the direct writer based on the terms of the reinsurance contract, which is known as the <em>treaty</em>. Actuaries help ensure that the compensation is proportionate to the amount of risk transferred. We discuss reinsurance in more detail in Chapter 3.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch1-div-87">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch1-h4-8">Non-traditional and Evolving Roles</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch1-p-173">As the insurance industry continues to evolve in response to technological advances and increasing global communication, the role of the actuary is evolving as well. For instance, many companies that formerly restricted their business to their home country have expanded into international markets. As a result, actuaries may have to track and account for variables and potential events occurring in multiple countries. Similarly, as new companies enter the life insurance market from other industries, actuaries must be able to communicate complicated technical concepts to co-workers and managers who do not have extensive experience with insurance technical product design.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-174">As noted previously, the volume of big data compiled by modern technology is immense. And over time, big data keeps getting bigger. Each year, more data arrives, and the sophistication of tools to analyze and interpret that data increases in an attempt to keep up with the greater volume. Insurers offer more complex products, and actuaries use increasingly complicated models to assist in the design of these products. This ongoing change demands thorough analytical skills and understanding of the concepts and assumptions underlying the models.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-175">One of the challenges of big data is determining what to do with it. Because many of the blocks of information are very specific, big data provides the opportunity for even greater accuracy in areas such as underwriting, risk assessment, and product development. However, the high complexity and volume make it difficult to quickly find the most relevant and credible data, especially for smaller insurers. Actuaries, often in tandem with data scientists, face the challenge of determining not just what data is most germane to the company’s goals, but also understanding the relationships between the many variables involved. The exceptionally high volume of data provides many answers to the question of “what?” But when sifting through this data, which often lacks a clear structure, actuaries need to be able to answer the question of “why?”</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-176">The increasing complexity of financial models also means that companies place rising emphasis on model management and control. Actuaries must provide more documentation for models, and the models require additional testing and annual re-testing. In addition, an appointed actuary generally must verify the assumptions underlying the models. A single financial model may require a complicated set of permissions detailing who can change the model, request a change to the model, or approve a change to the model.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-177">The pace of technological advancement means that the rapid disruption challenging the insurance industry is unlikely to decrease in intensity. The industry has coined the term <em>insurtech</em>, short for “insurance technology,” to refer to any new technology that has a potential impact on how life insurers do business. The potential of automated underwriting and the development of artificial intelligence for financial applications are two examples of insurtech. Insurtech has the potential to render many old ways of doing business obsolete, which may provide positive opportunities—such as reaching customer needs—as well as negative consequences such as the costs associated with rapid and exhaustive change.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-178">The issue of insurance fraud also provides new challenges for actuaries. The actuarial skillset contributes to a company’s efforts to detect fraud, such as by building predictive models using a variety of data sources. As fraud methods such as account takeover become more sophisticated, actuaries play an increasingly important role in fraud analytics.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch1-p-179">As you can see, the actuarial role of identifying and projecting risks has become more challenging in recent years, even as ever more sophisticated tools allow for greater precision in this role. Some risks have likewise emerged, strengthened, and evolved in the last few years. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss the most prominent risks that an insurance company must manage.</p>
