<p class="q-stem-static" id="loma371-ch1-p-14">The two primary goals of any insurer are to ensure solvency and increase profitability. But which of the following statements about solvency and profitability are true for insurers?</p>

<ol class="choices-static" id="loma371-ch1-ol-2">
	<li id="loma371-ch1-question-1-i0-static">Solvency is defined as a company’s overall degree of success in generating returns for its owners.</li>

</ol>

<p class="q-feedback" id="loma371-ch1-p-11">It’s true that companies generally measure capital by comparing their assets to their liabilities, and that greater risks on an investment imply greater potential returns on that investment. However, <strong>profitability</strong> is a company’s overall degree of success in generating returns for its owners, and the most significant liability for an insurer is its <strong>contractual reserves</strong>. We’ll explain these concepts further in this chapter.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The two primary goals of any insurer are to ensure solvency and increase profitability. In general, an insurer seeks to earn a level of profit that will both satisfy immediate financial needs and enhance the company’s long-term profitability goals. For an insurer, the long-term benefits of having strong profitability include all of the following <strong>EXCEPT</strong> for</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />higher interest rates on borrowed funds</li>
		<li>higher ratings from rating agencies</li>
		<li>greater ability to price products competitively</li>
		<li>greater growth and capacity to serve more customers</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Some benefits of strong solvency overlap benefits of strong profitability. However, profitability goals—such as investing enough assets to increase the probability of a strong return—sometimes conflict with solvency goals—such as retaining assets to pay possible liabilities.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers must be especially careful about the risks they take when pursuing profitability because (1) the purpose of the insurance industry is to provide financial protection for customers, and the promises made by insurance companies may span many decades and (2) the various regulatory requirements placed on insurance companies demand financial strength and stability.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 1A. Describe the strengths of strong solvency and strong profitability.</strong></p>

		<li>greatest potential return on an investment results from an investment that has no risk associated with it</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">To ensure strong solvency, an insurer must maintain capital and manage risk. To maintain strong profitability, an insurer must invest capital and take risk. A responsible investment balances the risk incurred with the potential return.</p>

	<p class="explanations">If a company holds on to too much capital rather than making investments, it cannot expect strong returns. A company that invests heavily in a risky venture accepts higher risks to its solvency to pursue higher expected returns. Conversely, a company that invests in a conservative venture accepts lower risks and lower expected returns.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Establishing a risk management culture includes defining a company’s risk appetite and risk tolerance. One common definition of (<strong>risk appetite</strong> / <strong>ris &amp; bsp;tolerance</strong>) is that it refers to the amount and type of risk that a company is prepared to seek in the pursuit of profits or other strategic objectives. Risk tolerance is a (<strong>quantitative / qualitative</strong>) expression of a company’s risk appetite.</p>

		<li>risk appetite / qualitative</li>
		<li>risk tolerance / quantitative</li>
		<li>risk tolerance / qualitative</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">One key method of establishing a risk management culture is enterprise risk management (ERM), which focuses on operations throughout a company, to the point that ERM becomes part of company culture.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Another part of establishing a risk management culture is defining a company’s risk appetite and risk tolerance. Risk tolerance is a company’s willingness and readiness to bear a risk to achieve its objectives; this tolerance usually is expressed as the company’s stated limits on risk-taking in specified categories. Under this two-tiered approach, risk appetite is a qualitative concept that describes a company’s attitude toward risk, while risk tolerance becomes the quantitative expression of the company’s risk appetite.</p>

With regard to comparisons between the typical roles of data scientists and actuaries in analyzing big data, it is generally true that</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>data scientists specialize in using traditional, retrospective methods to predict future outcomes</li>
		<li>data scientists have more experience with probability and the financial impacts of analysis</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />actuaries have a stronger focus on risk and must adhere to strictly regulated methods and tests</li>
		<li>actuaries tend to focus on new techniques and the search for potential opportunities</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Compared to data scientists, actuaries generally have more experience with probability and financial modeling and the financial ramifications and impacts of analysis; use past experience and established, retrospective methods to project future outcomes; are required to adhere to strictly regulated methods and tests; and have a stronger focus on risk. A notable aspect of actuarial work is the effort to anticipate circumstances beyond the company’s control by modeling unexpected outcomes and their impacts.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Compared to actuaries, data scientists typically have more experience with computer science and use new methods and techniques—such as neural networks and natural language processing—and explore prospective approaches; focus more on the search for potential opportunities; and answer primarily to company management.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">A control cycle is a repetitive process designed to ensure that all areas of a company adhere to the company’s performance standards. Specifically, the actuarial control cycle is a process of three repeated steps. Select the answer choice that correctly places these three steps in order, beginning with the first step.</p>

		<li>define the need → monitor the results → design the solution</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Actuarial functions generally involve applying the actuarial control cycle to a specific discipline or problem. In the context of new product development, the three steps of the actuarial control cycle begin with the first two steps: define the need (or sometimes define the problem)—by determining a customer need that is not being satisfied—and design the solution—by creating a product that will serve that customer need.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Once the product is on the market, the company conducts the third step: monitor the results—by seeing how the product’s lapse rates, expenses, number of claims, and other variables are performing compared to the assumptions made during technical product design—which is an ongoing step. The actuarial control cycle then repeats, beginning with the first step.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Most actuaries work in the insurance industry as employees or outside consultants. Some specialize in a function; others have a variety of responsibilities.

	<p class="explanations">The designation of appointed actuary, also called a valuation actuary or qualified actuary, has more to do with qualifications than a line of specific work.

	<p class="explanations">Big data provides the opportunity for even greater accuracy in areas such as underwriting, risk assessment, and product development. However, the high complexity and volume of big data make it difficult to quickly find the most relevant and credible data.</p>

	<p class="explanations">One challenge of big data is determining what to do with it.

	<p class="q-stem-static">Regulating contractual reserves and capital adequacy is important to an insurer’s solvency. Individuals and businesses that buy insurance policies, as well as their policy beneficiaries, expect the insurers that issue those policies to remain solvent over the long term so that the insurers will be able to pay benefits when due. Regulatory monitoring also indirectly helps other insurer stakeholders,&#160;including</p>

	<p class="explanations">The best way for an insurer to meet stakeholder expectations is to identify the risks that can affect insurer solvency and manage insurer exposure to those risks.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurance company employees expect the insurer to remain solvent so that they will continue to have jobs and earn paychecks. Governments—and society in general—expect insurers to remain solvent to support needs that the state potentially would have to provide otherwise. Vendors, including reinsurers, expect insurers to remain solvent in order to avoid business interruption to their companies. Creditors expect insurers to remain solvent so that they will cover their debts. In addition, stockholders expect public insurers to stay in business and grow so that they can benefit from their investment in the company.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The Actuarial Opinion and Memorandum (AOM) is a formal asset-liability management (ALM) report that consists of two documents: an actuarial opinion and an actuarial memorandum. The following statement(s) can correctly be made about the actuarial <em>opinion</em>:</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. All insurers licensed in the United States must submit an actuarial opinion to regulatory authorities with their Annual Statement. For large insurers, extensive financial modeling and actuarial analysis are required to justify the actuarial opinion. In addition, an appointed or a qualified actuary must sign the opinion.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. The Standard Valuation Law (SVL) is an NAIC model law that (1) imposes minimum requirements on the size of insurance and annuity reserves and (2) establishes guidelines insurers must follow when calculating their reserves. Under the SVL, an insurer is required to submit annually an actuarial opinion to regulators.

	<p class="q-stem-static">Historically, all life insurers in the United States established statutory reserves for their products based on prescribed formulas and assumptions using an approach to reserve valuation known as (<strong>rules-based / principles-based</strong>) reserving. The approach in which the assumptions, and therefore reserve levels, can change as the economic environment and other risk factors change is known as (<strong>rules-based / principles-based</strong>) reserving.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under the rules-based approach, life insurers establish statutory reserves for their products based on prescribed formulas and assumptions. All life insurers that sold a specific product were required to use the same formula for reserve valuation and the same estimates of future mortality and investment experience. The rules-based approach is a “one-size-fits-all” approach that created situations in which some insurers were holding either too little or too much in statutory reserves for a given product.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To address this imbalance, insurers are shifting toward principles-based reservin &amp; bsp;(PBR), which attempts to “right-size” an insurer’s reserves, so that the reserves an insurer holds are based on either prescribed factors or on the insurer’s own experience and risks, whichever is greater. By enabling insurers to calculate and report more accurate estimates for their statutory reserves, PBR enhances the reporting function and strengthens the financial position of the insurers that use it.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">To guard against the possibility of a gap between an insurer’s contractual reserves and its contractual obligations to customers, most jurisdictions require insurers to maintain at least a minimum amount, or standard, of capital to cover the gap. In particular, the legal minimum standard of capital that an insurer must maintain in order to be considered solvent by regulatory authorities is known as (<strong>statutory / economic</strong>) capital. From an insurer’s perspective, the parties that set the requirements for rating agency capital are considered to be (<strong>internal / external</strong>) to the insurer.</p>

		<li>economic / internal</li>
		<li>economic / external</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The various forms of required capital generally are referred to as regulatory capital. Failure to meet the requirement for statutory capital signals impending insolvency.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Rating agency capital refers to the minimum standard of capital that an insurer must maintain in order to receive a favorable quality rating from a specific rating agency. Rating agency capital generally is higher than regulatory capital because it factors in profitability.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Economic capital, also known as internal capital, is an estimate of the amount of capital that an insurer calculates to internally manage its own risks. A typical value for the specified percentage is 99.5 percent. Economic capital is designed to cover unexpected obligations and adverse deviations in pricing assumptions. Economic capital usually is higher than rating agency capital and regulatory capital.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, life insurers must regularly demonstrate their solvency to state insurance regulators in jurisdictions in which they are licensed to sell their products.

	<p class="q-stem-static">Contingency risks (C-risks) generally are separated into four categories to which insurers are exposed. The contingency risk that an insurer’s actual experience with specific factors—such as mortality rates, operating expenses, or policyholder behavior—will differ significantly from the actuarial assumptions used in the product’s financial design, causing the insurer to lose money on its products, is known as</p>

		<li>interest-rate risk (C-3 risk)</li>
		<li>general management risk (C-4 risk)</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act<em> <strong> </strong> </em>is an NAIC model law that establishes the risk-based capital (RBC) requirements and enables state insurance departments to identify potentially impaired insurers. These RBC requirements are used to determine the minimum capital level of an insurer and are based on the insurer’s size and risk profile, as identified by a specific risk-weighted formula.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In the United States, regulators have identified four officially recognized categories of contingency risks (C-risks) that are crucial to an insurer’s cash flows and that directly affect an insurer’s capital adequacy. This contingency risk classification system does not necessarily reflect how an individual company might classify, define, and prioritize all of its risks.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers can control pricing risk (C-2 risk) by maintaining sound actuarial and underwriting practices, evaluating insurance risks conservatively, using reinsurance when appropriate, controlling their expenses, designing products sensibly, and conducting routine experience analysis on mortality, lapse, and interest rate assumptions.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">When an insurer becomes financially unsound, insurance regulators generally are authorized to intervene in the insurer’s operations to protect policyowner interests. In the United States, state laws prescribe the types of corrective action when an insurer’s financial soundness is impaired. When drastic regulatory action is required, state regulators may place the insurer in receivership. The two possible outcomes of receivership are</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>rehabilitation and administrative supervision</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />rehabilitation and liquidation</li>
		<li>the company action level and administrative supervision</li>
		<li>the company action level and liquidation</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The company action level and administrative supervision are not possible outcomes of receivership, but are types of corrective actions taken before insolvency occurs. When more drastic regulatory action is required, state regulators either are authorized or mandated to place the insurer in receivership. In rehabilitation, regulators take over operation of the insolvent company from management and attempt to restore the company to solvent.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In liquidation, regulators either transfer all of the insurer’s business to other insurers or sell the insurer’s assets and terminate the insurer’s business. State guaranty associations provide insurers with financial support to protect customers of a failed insurer with continuation coverage. Many other countries have a national guaranty association.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">One type of risk that an insurer faces is the risk the insurer will not receive the cash flows to which it is entitled because a party with which the insurer has a financial arrangement is late with payments or entirely fails to fulfill its debt obligations.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Insurer solvency is linked directly to an insurer’s ability to manage the risks associated with its investments, pricing, business, and operations. Because insurers hold a large amount of debt securities in their general accounts, credit risk exposures are one of the main threats for insurer portfolios.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Credit risk is the risk that (1) a borrower defaults on debt obligations by failing to make payments of principal or interest on time, or (2) a lender sustains a financial loss based on an adverse change in a borrower’s creditworthiness. These two types of credit risk are known as default risk and downgrade risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Default risk affects all types of debt securities and affects corporate equity securities, which lose substantial market value if the issuing company defaults on its debt obligations and becomes insolvent. Downgrade risk involves the risk of deterioration in a credit rating assigned to an issuer of a debt security.</p>

	<p class="explanations">When an investment goes into default or is downgraded, its market value also decreases. A credit downgrade does not affect payments of principal or interest to investors. Typically, defaults cause larger market value drops than downgrades.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Distribution risk, a type of operational risk, is the risk of financial losses resulting from activities and resources involved in making products available to customers. Given the crucial role distribution channels play in the insurance business, this risk can potentially threaten a company’s financial condition.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Types of operational risk include strategy risk, distribution risk, reputation risk, human resources risk, business process risk, cyber risk, and fraud risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The types of investment risk that have the greatest priority for life insurers are credit risk and market risk. Market risk can take many forms, including equity risk, inflation risk, interest-rate risk, reinvestment-rate risk, currency risk, foreign investment risk, and liquidity risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 2G. Describe the types of risks that insurers face—such as investment risk, pricing risk, business risk, and operational risk—and explain how each type of risk can affect insurer solvency.</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">If a proposed insured represents a higher-than-average risk, the Mica Life Insurance Company charges a higher premium than it would charge a similar proposed insured who represents an average risk. With regard to the five basic risk management strategies—avoiding risk, accepting risk, controlling risk, transferring risk, and exploiting risk—Mica’s charging a higher premium to a proposed insured who represents a higher-than-average risk best describes the strategy known as</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>avoiding risk</li>
		<li>accepting risk</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />controlling risk</li>
		<li>transferring risk</li>
		<li>exploiting risk</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Because insurance companies are in the business of assuming risk, avoiding risk is not always a practical risk management strategy. An insurer can accept a risk and retain some or all of the financial responsibility for that risk. The insurer also may control the risk to reduce or eliminate the potential losses associated with that risk, as Mica demonstrates in this situation. Mica charges a higher premium to control part of the risk that it has accepted. Controlling risk and accepting risk are not mutually exclusive events.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Typically, as a direct writer, an insurer can transfer risk through reinsurance, but also must accept the risk that the reinsurer will fail to perform its part of the agreement. The insurer controls risk by sharing the contract’s liability. In this situation, controlling risk, accepting risk, and transferring risk are not mutually exclusive events.</p>

	<p class="explanations">An insurer also can exploit risk by taking advantage of an opportunity presented by a risk. As with other risks, an insurer typically also chooses to accept and control an exploited risk. The insurer must be confident the potential losses are an acceptable hazard in light of the potential gains in this situation.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">For this question, if answer choices (1) through (3) are all correct, select answer choice (4). Otherwise, select the one correct response.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Generally, effective risk management programs in life insurance companies have an established governance structure, a risk taxonomy, and a system of internal controls. When combined, these practices contribute to a risk management approach called the three lines of defense, which include</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>operational management</li>
		<li>risk management and compliance</li>
		<li>internal audit</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />all of the above</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The three lines of defense is a comprehensive, systematic approach to enhancing communication on risk management and controls by assigning clear responsibilities and roles to each line. The first line of defense is operational management, which owns and manages the risks under its supervision. Operational, or “frontline,” managers are responsible for identifying and assessing risk within their unit daily, ensuring controls are in place, and taking corrective actions when needed.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The second line of defense is risk management and compliance, which consists of the internal monitoring and oversight functions—such as a risk committee and compliance function—that oversees risks throughout the company.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The third line of defense is internal audit. Internal auditors provide independent assurance to the board of directors and senior management on the effectiveness of the company’s governance, its risk management practices, and its internal controls, including the level of performance for the first two lines of defense achieved. The main difference between the third line of defense and the first two lines is its high level of independence and objectivity.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">A governance structure provides guidance so that a life insurer can achieve its strategic objectives. Common approaches that life insurers use for the governance of a risk management function include:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. The CRO usually reports to the company’s chief executive officer (CEO) and board of directors. An insurer’s CRO, risk committee, or some combination of the two must establish the insurer’s risk management culture. In addition, an insurer’s Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) Annual Summary Report must be signed by the CRO or an equivalent person.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. A cross-functional risk committee, which reports to the board of directors, is the heart of most insurance companies’ internal control system and is a key part of the second line of defense. The primary role of the risk committee is to provide overall guidance and control of an insurer’s risk management efforts. This committee is responsible for identifying, measuring, and managing all the significant risks to which an insurer is exposed, including operational risks.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>defines risk as the potential for losses, and primarily focuses on preventing or minimizing suc &amp; bsp;losses</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">ERM and traditional risk management share many specific practices in common, such as employing a CRO, maintaining a risk committee, and establishing a risk taxonomy. The key differences between the two systems are the number of risks encompassed and ERM’s inclusion of risk as an opportunity for gain.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Traditional risk management emphasizes only certain risks that an insurer faces, whereas ERM works to improve an insurer’s overall risk-return profile. ERM takes a top-down, enterprise-wide approach to viewing all of the significant risks that could affect an insurer’s strategic objectives. According to ERM, risk is any negative consequence a company faces as it conducts its operations, including the failure to meet objectives or to exploit profitable opportunities.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Various authorities have developed risk management frameworks to be used as guides for implementing risk management. The following statement(s) can correctly be made about three of the most well-known risk management frameworks—the ORSA ERM framework, the COSO ERM framework, and the ISO 31000 standard:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>According to the ORSA ERM framework, an effective risk management framework should incorporate a minimum of five key principles.</li>
		<li>The premise of the COSO ERM framework is that internal controls should help organizations achieve their objectives in the areas of operations, reporting, and compliance.</li>

		<li>B and C only</li>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. The five key principles that should be incorporated in the ORSA ERM framework are risk culture and governance; risk identification and prioritization; risk appetite, tolerances, and limits; risk management and controls; and risk reporting and communications.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. The COSO ERM framework is sorted into five components supported by twenty principles that can be used to enhance performance and meet strategic objectives.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is correct. All three frameworks contain similar approaches to managing risk, although there are some key differences. For example, ORSA requires each insurer to evaluate its risk management framework on an annual basis, whereas neither the COSO ERM framework nor the ISO 31000 standard contains such a requirement (each is voluntary). Each insurer selects a risk management framework that best fits its strategic objectives and individual risk exposures.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A is correct. An economic recession is an example of nondiversifiable risk, also known as systematic risk, which is the risk that affects all assets in an economic system, and is therefore not specific to an individual asset or issuer.</p>

	<p class="explanations">B is incorrect. Most financial risks are diversifiable risks. Diversifiable risk, also known as nonsystematic risk or specific risk, is specific to an individual asset or issuer. In the context of investing, default risk is a type of credit risk in which an insurer will not receive the cash flows to which it is entitled because a party with which the insurer has a financial arrangement is late with payments or entirely fails to fulfill its debt obligations. By definition, credit risk is the risk that (1) a borrower defaults on debt obligations by failing to make payments of principal or interest on time, or (2) a lender sustains a financial loss based on an adverse change in a borrower’s creditworthiness.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A key risk indicator (KRI) indicates the level of operational risk exposures at a given point of time in order to help insurers forecast future occurrences. By monitoring KRIs and checking them against agreed limits and thresholds, insurers see if their operational risk exposures are within stated risk tolerances.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A risk map, also called a risk heat map,<em> <strong> </strong> </em>categorizes each risk identified for a particular operational or business process along two dimensions—(1) impact or significance and (2) likelihood.

	<p class="explanations">A loss-incident database records every loss and allows insurers to review operational activities from a single system and then identify incidents or activities that create or have the potential to create losses, analyze the company’s performance during those incidents, create summaries, and make recommendations for improvements.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers typically derive model inputs for financial models from four sources: actuarial assumptions, internal and industry experience data, regulatory requirements, and estimates of possible future conditions. The values of these independent variables can be derived from real-world observations or can be selected randomly from a data distribution.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In financial modeling, a dependent variable reacts to changes in other variables. The rule, or function, that describes how a dependent variable relates to—or depends on—an independent variable is usually written as <em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>). Insurers use financial model outputs to perform financial analysis and to make decisions about deploying capital, budgeting and forecasting, growing business, and prioritizing product ideas.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Life insurers make assumptions that represent unknown future values within the context of product pricing, product reserving, and other modeling applications for life insurance and annuity products.

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Stochastic </strong>assumptions are variables that are selected randomly from a specified statistical distribution applied across multiple simulations or scenarios. Insurers can use stochastic assumptions to model unknown future quantities and to measure the sensitivity of an assumption to the model’s result.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Stochastic assumptions are used when assumptions are unknown and cannot be easily modeled using a dynamic formula. Some assumptions are unknown because a product is new or contains new features with which an insurer has no experience. Other assumptions are based on factors that are completely outside the control of the insurer, such as market interest rates and equity market returns.</p>

Futures studies identify possible developments that could disrupt trends and then produce an array of possibilities for future values based on these developments.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Compared to traditional experience studies, futures studies require users to view information from a broader perspective, conduct more detailed analyses of results, project outcomes along a longer time horizon, and shift from scientific to speculative, or even visionary, thinking.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>thousands of iterations are needed for each input variable when using deterministic modeling, whereas only one run of input variables is needed when using stochastic modeling</li>
		<li>input variables for deterministic modeling are derived from potential future outcomes, whereas input variables for stochastic modeling are derived from analyzing historical experience data</li>

		<li>deterministic modeling accounts for the uncertainty in an insurer’s estimated cash flows by treating one or more components of the cash flows as random variables, whereas stochastic modeling treats all estimated cash flows as though they are certain</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Although deterministic modeling does not inherently account for risks or probabilities, actuaries can acknowledge risks through defined conditions, such as the rates used to discount cash flows. In effect, the user adjusts the inputs to reflect the risk involved.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Users also can acknowledge risk by basing the number of alternative scenarios they evaluate on the sensitivity of the output to changes in input values. For most variables, insurers need between 1 and 20 scenarios to achieve a reasonable estimate. One popular approach is to develop three possible scenarios: a pessimistic scenario, an optimistic scenario, and a best estimate (or most likely) scenario.</p>

	<p class="explanations">If the goal of a model were to produce probabilities of results, then actuaries most likely would use stochastic modeling. To support probabilistic results, a stochastic model must begin with a data set of potential future outcomes for all critical variables. The major benefits of stochastic modeling are a high volume of decision-support information, with results accompanied by assessments of probability and risk.</p>
