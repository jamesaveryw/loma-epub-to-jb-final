<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma371-ch9-h2-7">Incorporating Operating Expense Charges into Product Designs</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-238">For some products such as immediate annuities, insurers do not disclose expenses to customers as separate charges, but rather incorporate expenses and other components of product design into the premium. For most life insurance products and deferred annuity products, insurers offset at least some operating expenses by means of explicit charges to customers. These charges can be one-time charges assessed at the time of purchase, or periodic charges assessed monthly, yearly, or at other predetermined intervals. The number and type of charges incorporated into a product structure depend partly on whether the product is fixed or variable.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch9-h3-11">Explicit Expense Charges in Fixed Products</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-239">Insurers typically classify the explicit expense charges included in fixed insurance and annuity products as administrative charges and transaction charges, as summarized in the chart below.</p>

<h4 id="loma371-ch9-h4-3">Administrative Charges</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-264">An <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-administrativecharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-85" role="doc-glossref">administrative charge</span> is a charge an insurer levies to cover the cost of issuing certain types of life insurance or annuity contracts, making administrative changes to such contracts, preparing contract owner statements, and performing general maintenance activities. Depending on how the company classifies its charges and expenses, administrative charges may also be known as <em>administrative expense charges</em>, <em>administrative fees</em>, <em>contract fees</em>, or <em>service fees</em>. Most administrative charges are assessed periodically. For universal life products, insurers typically calculate administrative charges as a flat amount per month based on the units of coverage. However, these administrative charges can also be calculated as a percentage of premium per period.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-265">Fixed annuities generally do not assess explicit administrative charges. For fixed immediate annuities, the insurer factors administrative charges into the single premium payment. In fixed-rate deferred annuities, the interest spread covers applicable administrative expenses.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch9-div-108">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch9-h4-4">Transaction Charges</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-266"><em>Transaction charges</em> are one-time charges assessed when funds are paid into or withdrawn from a customer’s account. Transaction charges include sales charges and surrender charges.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-267">Most insurers do not assess separate sales charges. Occasionally, however, insurers assess sales charges on fixed products when premiums are paid. In these cases, sales charges are designed to cover commissions and other sales costs. For fixed insurance products, sales charges are typically calculated as either a flat amount per transaction or a percentage of the amount of the transaction. Very few fixed-rate deferred annuities offered today assess sales charges; when such a product contains a sales charge, the charge is calculated as a percentage of the premium.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-268">Insurers use surrender charges to provide protection against surrender and withdrawal rates that exceed projections. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-surrendercharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-86" role="doc-glossref">surrender charge</span> is a charge imposed when the owner of a cash value life insurance policy surrenders the policy for its cash surrender value, or if the owner of a deferred annuity contract surrenders the contract within a stated number of years after it was purchased. Insurers design surrender charges to cover acquisition, issue, and sales costs. For both fixed life insurance products and fixed-rate deferred annuities, surrender charges are a specified percentage of the amount received when the policy or contract is surrendered.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-269">Insurers generally impose surrender charges that are highest during the early years of a contract and then decrease gradually over time.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma371-ch9-div-109">
<div class="inner" id="loma371-ch9-div-110">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-270">A flat surrender charge might be $15 per unit for the first three years, after which the charge decreases by $1.50 per unit for each year thereafter until the charge disappears. A specified percentage surrender charge might be 8 percent of the amount withdrawn for the first year, after which the charge decreases by 1 percent each year until the charge disappears.</p>

<h3 id="loma371-ch9-h3-12">Explicit Expense Charges in Variable Products</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-271">The expense charges for variable products—or, as they are often called outside the United States and Canada, <em>unit-linked products</em>—can be categorized as administrative charges and transaction charges. U.S. securities laws require that all expense charges in variable products—including variable life insurance and variable annuity products—be disclosed separately.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch9-div-112">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch9-h4-5">Administrative Charges</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-272">The classification of expense charges varies from insurer to insurer. The following examples are some of the most commonly seen administrative charges on variable (unit-linked) life insurance and annuity products:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch9-ul-22">
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-85">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-273">An insurer may periodically charge a general <em>administrative charge</em> to cover a variety of costs, such as making administrative changes to the contract and records, crediting investment earnings to contract accounts, and paying claims and annuity income benefits.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-86">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-274">A common administrative charge in variable deferred annuities is a <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-contractmaintenancecharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-87" role="doc-glossref">contract maintenance charge</span>, which is a periodic charge assessed to cover general maintenance costs, such as preparation of account and other statements. Insurers typically express contract maintenance charges as a flat monetary amount per contract per month or per year. Insurers often waive contract maintenance charges for contracts whose value is above a specified amount, such as $50,000.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-87">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-275">An insurer may assess a <em>rider charge</em> if the customer purchases a variable annuity guarantee rider. We discuss rider charges further in Chapter 11.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-88">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-276">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-mortalityandexpenseriskcharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-88" role="doc-glossref">mortality and expense (M&amp;E) risk charge</span> is a charge assessed to compensate the insurer for the mortality and expense risks inherent in the assumptions made when designing the product. The mortality portion of the risk charge covers the insurer’s obligation to provide mortality-based benefits such as guaranteed death benefits and lifetime annuity periodic payments. The expense portion of the risk charge covers the insurer’s obligation to administer the contract. A typical M&amp;E risk charge ranges from 1.00 to 1.75 percent of the accumulated value.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-89">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-277">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-fundoperatingexpensecharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-89" role="doc-glossref">fund operating expense charge</span> is a periodic charge that a fund manager assesses to cover its costs of managing variable subaccount assets, buying and selling securities, and administering trades. These charges are typically calculated as a percentage of the account values and are deducted from those values before earnings are distributed to shareholders.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma371-ch9-div-113">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma371-ch9-h4-6">Transaction Charges</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma371-ch9-p-278">Transaction charges for variable products can be divided into three categories: sales charges, transfer charges, and surrender charges.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-279">The sales charges assessed on variable insurance and annuity products are designed to cover the insurer’s sales and contract issue costs and the costs of ongoing services provided by sales intermediaries. Funds that impose sales charges can structure these charges in one of the following ways:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma371-ch9-ul-23">
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-90">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-280">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-frontendsalescharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-90" role="doc-glossref">front-end sales charge</span> is a one-time transaction charge imposed when an investor purchases shares in a subaccount. Front-end sales charges generally are calculated as a percentage of the amount invested.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma371-ch9-li-91">
	<p id="loma371-ch9-p-281">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-backendsalescharge" epub:type="glossref" id="loma371-ch9-span-91" role="doc-glossref">back-end sales charge</span> is a sales charge assessed when an investor sells a security. In the context of life insurance and annuity products, the securities sold are typically shares in a subaccount fund. Back-end sales charges are calculated as a percentage of the amount sold.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-282">Variable life insurance products generally include back-end sales charges. For variable annuity products, sales charges may be either front-end sales charges or, more commonly, back-end sales charges.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-283">Surrender charges on variable products are designed to cover the costs of selling or redeeming fund shares to cover withdrawals or surrenders and are similar to the surrender charges assessed for fixed products. The amount of these charges is typically based on the amount withdrawn. As is the case with surrender charges for fixed products, surrender charges for variable products are structured on a decreasing scale.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma371-ch9-p-284">Most insurers allow owners of variable contracts to transfer funds from one subaccount to another without charge, as long as the transfers fall within specified limits, such as amount or frequency. Transfer charges apply to transfers that exceed these limits. Charges for transfers in excess of allowed amounts are usually calculated as a percentage of the amount transferred.</p>
