<p class="q-stem-static" id="loma371-ch7-p-18">An insurer’s product design decisions are based on the concept of the time value of money, which means that the value of a sum of money changes over time if invested with positive interest. According to this principle, the value of a sum of money received in the present would be (<strong>lesser</strong> / <strong>greater</strong>) than the value of the same sum of money received five years from now.</p>

	<p class="explanations">All insurers have a general account, also known as a general account<strong> </strong>portfolio,<em> </em>for assets that support the insurer’s contractual obligations to owners of the insurer’s guaranteed products and any guarantees found in variable products.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers that offer variable products maintain one or more separate accounts, also known as<em> </em>separate account portfolios or segregated account portfolios, for assets that support the insurer’s variable products. An insurer typically divides separate account portfolios into smaller subaccounts; each subaccount consists of a pool of investments with a distinct risk-return profile, or fund style.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The insurer bears the investment risks associated with the general account. The customer, rather than the insurer, determines how premiums are applied to subaccounts. The customer also bears the investment risks associated with a variable product that is funded by a separate account.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Last year, the Magnolia Life Insurance Company purchased 100 shares of JKL common stock at $45 per share. Magnolia held the JKL stock for one year, then sold all 100 JKL shares at $52 per share. During the year that Magnolia owned JKL, Magnolia received $4 per share in dividends. The following statement(s) can correctly be made about Magnolia’s investment in JKL:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Magnolia realized a gain on JKL as a result of price appreciation.</li>
		<li>Magnolia correctly calculated its total rate of return on JKL by dividing $700 by $4,500.</li>

		<li>B only</li>
		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. An investor realizes a gain when an asset’s selling price is higher than the asset’s purchase price. Gains generally result from price appreciation. In this situation, Magnolia’s investment in JKL experienced price appreciation by increasing $7 per share, from $45 to $52, for a $700 gain.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is incorrect. The total return on an investment is the sum of all the investment’s earnings. The total rate of return is determined by summing all of an asset’s earnings—such as gains and dividends—and dividing this sum by the asset’s price at purchase, or principal.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, Magnolia’s total return on JKL common stock consists of price appreciation and dividends: [($52 – $45) × 100] + ($4&#160;×&#160;100)] = $1,100. JKL’s purchase price equals ($45 × 100) = $4,500. Therefore, the total rate of return on JKL equals $1,100 ÷ $4,500 = 24.44%.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. The present value (PV of a sum of money is the amount that, if invested at a specified interest rate on a specified date, would grow to equal a specified future amount. The periods used in PV calculations are known as discounting periods.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is incorrect. The future value (FV) of a sum of money is the amount that the original sum is expected to be worth at a specified future date, given a specified interest rate. The periods used in FV calculations are known as compounding periods.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The present value of an investment is the principal—the original amount invested before it earns interest—and the future value is the invested principal plus the accumulated earnings. These calculations also assume compound interest; therefore, compounding periods and discounting periods are relevant.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Investment growth is based on a concept known as the time value of money, which states that the value of a sum of money changes over time as a result of the effects of interest. The time value of money concept also assumes that interest earnings are positive. The effects of the time value of money are calculated using one of two values: future value and present value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Future value calculations are useful when an insurer knows the specific sum it intends to invest and needs to know how much the investment is likely to earn. Present value calculations are useful when an insurer has identified a specific sum as a future goal and needs to know how much to invest to achieve that goal.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers often calculate the future value of a single amount over multiple periods—as with a single-premium life insurance or annuity product. Insurer applications for calculating the future value of a sum of money include matching projected earnings with projected liabilities, projecting benefits for products that credit an interest rate to customers, calculating cash values, tracking investment performance, and projecting the future value of premium payments.</p>

	<p class="explanations">When a sum or money is invested for more than one interest period, the interest is compounded: that is, the present value (PV) is multiplied by one plus the interest rate—(1&#160;+&#160;<em>i</em>)—one time for each interest period (<em>n</em>) in which interest (<em>i</em>) is applied. In the formula for Mr.&#160;Spoth’s calculation, <em>i</em> equals 0.05, and <em>n</em> equals 4. Therefore, he would multiply $10,000&#160;×&#160;(1.05)<sup style="font-size:0.8em; line-height:0em; position:relative; top:-0.4em; vertical-align:baseline">4</sup>, which results in a future value of $12,155.06.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Two examples of an ordinary annuity are an employee’s paycheck paid at the end of each work period and a bond interest payment received one period after the bond is issued. When calculating the future value of an ordinary annuity, the final payment earns no interest because it is paid at the end of the last compoundin &amp; bsp;period.</p>

	<p class="explanations">An annuity due is a series of periodic payments for which the payment occurs at the beginning of each specified payment period. Another example of an ordinary annuity is a series of rent payments. When calculating the future value of an annuity due, all payments, including the final payment, earn interest for at least one compounding period.</p>

		<li>$75,000 × (0.676 + 1)</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The basic calculation for present value involves multiplying the future value (or desired goal) by 1 divided by the sum of 1 + the interest rate, often represented as 1 ÷ (1 + <em>i</em>). Insurers can use this calculation as the basis for determining present values for a single amount over one or more periods or for an annuity. Insurer applications for calculating the present value of a sum of money include setting premium rates, developing an investment budget, calculating cash values, and measuring profitability.</p>

	<p class="explanations">As when calculating future value, software and financial calculators are common tools for determining the present value for single amounts or annuities. Present value interest factors (PVIFs) and present value interest factor tables are also available, both separately and incorporated into such electronic tools. In this situation, the present value of $75,000, discounted at 4% for 10 years, is calculated by multiplying $75,000 by 0.676, or PVIF(10,&#160;4%), which equals $50,700.</p>

		<li>1.3% / lower</li>
		<li>2.8% / higher</li>
		<li>2.8% / lower</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Interest rates affect both how much money an insurer expects to receive from its customers and how much it expects to pay to its customers. The interest spread, also known as the interest margin or interest-rate margin, which is one measure of a product’s potential rate of return, is the difference between the rate of return an insurer earns on its investments and the interest-crediting rate. The interest spread for a fixed annuity contract is equal to the difference between the rate of return the insurer actually earns and the interest-crediting rate. In this situation, the interest spread for Mr.&#160;Gesta’s contract is 5.2%&#160;–&#160;3.9% =&#160;1.3%.</p>

	<p class="explanations">During product design, an insurer must set a premium amount that, along with investment earnings, will produce enough money to cover the cost of promised benefits when due. The interest rate used in product design generally is known as the interest-rate assumption, or the assumed interest rate. The insurer projects an expected interest rate on the product’s associated investments and sets a lower assumed interest rate in order to earn an expected level of profit on the product.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Permanent life insurance products are often referred to as cash value insurance products because they offer the additional feature of the contract owner’s equity in the form of a cash value, which contract owners can access in the form of policy loans, withdrawal and surrender benefits, or nonforfeiture benefits. One true statement about the cash values of these products is that</p>

		<li>both the cash value of a fixed life insurance contract and the accumulated value of a deferred annuity contract are equal to the current value of the contract owner’s equity in the contract</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers set a cash value for fixed life insurance products based on the amount of premiums paid on the policy, the face amount of the policy, and the amount of time the policy has been in force. Insurers can use either prospective or retrospective valuation methods to calculate this cash value. The great majority of insurers use the prospective valuation method, which looks at a product’s future cash flows.</p>

	<p class="explanations">By contrast, a retrospective valuation method looks at a product’s past cash flows. This method uses future value, or accumulated value, techniques to base cash value on past performance. Though prospective and retrospective valuation both arrive at the same cash values, regulations require most insurers to use prospective valuation for new products.</p>

Economic conditions have caused a rise in market interest rates. However, because Dignity owns many investments that were purchased at lower interest rates, the average rate of return on Dignity’s existing invested assets is rising more slowly than market interest rates. Because Dignity’s customers immediately demand the higher market interest rate applied to Dignity’s fixed-rate deferred annuities, Dignity has chosen to increase interest-crediting rates.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Spread compression does not occur automatically, because an insurer can offer lower interest rates to keep its spread constant instead of offering customers a higher rate. But, by refusing to offer customers the higher market interest rate, existing customers are less likely to continue business with the insurer, and new customers may be harder to attract.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Spread expansion, which is a widening of an insurer’s interest spread, occurs when market interest rates fall and the insurer reduces interest-crediting rates to the new market level while continuing to earn a higher overall rate of return on its existing invested assets. Decreasing market interest rates create the opportunity for spread expansion, but they do not guarantee it. Borrowers who are paying older and higher interest rates may refinance to repay their debts in full before repayment is due.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Incorporating nonguaranteed elements (NGEs) in product design, such as policy dividends on participating fixed premium life insurance policies, is another method of managing interest-rate risk that can be implemented during product design. Insurers can take a number of corrective actions, such as offsetting specified interest-rate risks with purchases of derivative securities, to address potential deviations from the company’s interest-rate risk standards.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A typical steering control for interest-rate risk is the initial interest-crediting rate on a product. A typical concurrent control is the automatic checks in a system. A typical feedback control is an internal audit. Concurrent and feedback controls monitor and compare actual performance or output with established standards such as the policies, procedures, risk tolerances, and codes of conduct that were established as steering controls. Ultimately, insurers must use a wide variety of controls to manage interest-rate risk, with the understanding that market interest rates are beyond an insurer’s control.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The NPV of an investment project is calculated by subtracting the project’s initial investment from the present value (PV) of the project’s earnings over a certain period, usually the entire expected life of the product. An insurer selects an interest rate, <em>i</em>, that reflects the return the insurer believes would be necessary to accept the risk inherent in the project. If an insurer selects a 10% interest rate, the insurer has decided it is willing to accept the risk the new product represents as long as the product’s estimated return over the period is at least 10%. Insurers generally select lower interest rates for products that represent lower risks and higher interest rates for products that represent higher risks.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, the project’s initial investment is $175,000, and the present value of the project’s earnings is calculated as [($50,000&#160;×&#160;0.909) + ($50,000&#160;×&#160;0.826) + ($50,000&#160;×&#160;0.751) + ($50,000&#160;×&#160;0.683) + ($50,000&#160;×&#160;0.621)] = $45,450 + $41,300 + $37,550 + $34,150 + $31,050 = $186,126. In this situation, the project’s NPV equals $189,500&#160;–&#160;$175,000 = $14,500.</p>

	<p class="explanations">If NPV is a positive number, then the product is expected to earn a profit as long as the assumptions are accurate. The general rule for NPV is that as long as a proposed product’s NPV is positive, the insurer should consider pursuing the product. Because this project’s NPV is positive, Ms.&#160;Rashid most likely would recommend that Accolade accept the project.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers that wish to account for the level of risk in a product’s cash flows set a risk-adjusted minimum IRR<em> </em>for a product and then compare the product’s projected IRR to the risk-adjusted minimu &amp; bsp;IRR. A simple decision rule is to require that the projected IRR be greater than or equal to the insurer’s risk-adjusted minimum IRR for the product. If the projected IRR is less than the risk-adjusted minimum IRR, then the insurer will likely not proceed with developing the product as is.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In Tiller’s situation, Product X has a 17% projected IRR, which is greater than the product’s risk-adjusted minimum IRR of 14%. Product Y has a 12% projected IRR, which is less than the product’s risk-adjusted minimum IRR of 14%. Thus, Tiller most likely will develop Product X but not Product Y.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Some insurers refer to the IRR as the return on investment (ROI). For example, an insurer determines that the NPV for its proposed new product would be equal to zero when the interest rate is 12%; therefore, the projected IRR for the product is 12%.</p>

	<p class="explanations">An insurer can instead use its hurdle rate as the required IRR. A hurdle rate, or required return, is a minimum percentage rate of return on capital that an insurer must earn to cover its cost of capital. Although the methods used to calculate the cost of capital vary, they generally involve a combination of the various interest costs, transaction costs, and cost of equity an insurer pays for funds. An insurer’s hurdle rate is independent of product risk, and typically applies to all products and all lines of business.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">For this question, if answer choices (1) through (3) are all correct, select answer choice (4). Otherwise, select the one correct response.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">To estimate the amount and timing of future annuity benefit payments as accurately as possible, an insurer must make assumptions regarding mortality, which affects the timing and amount of benefit payments. For life annuities in the payout phase, calculating mortality helps an insurer to determine</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Mortality affects the timing and amount of benefit payments in a variety of ways. For annuities in the accumulation phase, contract terminations from all causes influence the cost of benefits. In general, the effect of mortality on the cost of benefits is limited to any account values payable on the death of the contract owner. Mortality estimates affect the payout factors guaranteed in the contract and affect the pricing of death benefit options under optional rider benefits and guaranteed death benefits.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For life insurance policies, mortality determines when an insurer must make benefit payments. Insurers project death benefits using historical mortality data to estimate the pattern of deaths in an insured group. They also project life insurance terminations for causes other than death using historical lapse data.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Actuaries develop mortality assumptions for a variety of purposes, including pricing, reserving, and product modeling for a life insurance or annuity product. As part of the basic process for developing mortality assumptions, actuaries develop mortality rates that have been adjusted to reflect a hypothetical number of rate of deaths in a given block of people. These mortality rates, which are entered into the actuarial models of products, are known as</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">An actuary begins estimating mortality costs for a given purpose by identifying appropriate mortality experience and calculating experience mortality rates. Next, the actuary develops a basic mortality table that best fits the experience mortality rates. Extrapolating from the basic mortality rates, the actuary creates a curve of expected mortality rates.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The actuary may be able to use the curve of expected mortality rates without further adjustment. However, adjustments may be necessary to ensure that the data is credible enough for the insurer to rely on it. By adjusting expected mortality, the actuary creates useful mortality assumptions in the form of assumed mortality rates, which are entered into actuarial models of products.</p>

		<li>Even if an insured in the cohort surrenders, lapses, or otherwise ends her policy, the insurer tracks that individual’s mortality after the policy ends.</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. A mortality table begins with a cohort of 100,000 members. The size of the cohort decreases each year as cohort members die. The number representing the size of the cohort is based on the concept of exposure, or how many individuals in the age group were “exposed” to death during the time period in question. If an insured in the cohort surrenders, lapses, or otherwise ends her policy, the insurer can no longer accurately track that individual’s mortality after the policy ends.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Actuaries calculate the mortality rate by dividing the number of deaths by a number representing the size of the cohort. Mortality tables can also provide survival rates for each age, which are particularly useful for designing annuities. Calculate the survival rate either by dividing the number of survivors by the size of the cohort or by subtracting the equivalent mortality rate from 1.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Determine the number of men who are expected to survive to age 67 by subtracting the number dying at age 66 from the number living at age 66 at the beginning of the year. The mortality table shows the number living at age 66 is 99,175, and the number expected to die at age 66 is 905. Therefore, the number of men who are expected to survive to age 67 is 98,270.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Another way to calculate the number of men who are expected to survive to age 67 is to subtract the mortality rate of men age 66, which we know is 9.13 per thousand or 0.00913, from 1, to determine the survival rate: 1 – 0.00913 = 0.99087. Then, multiply the survival rate for men age 66 by the number of men living at the beginning of the year: 0.99087 × 99,175 = 98,270.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The Trio Life Insurance Company is a large insurance company.

	<p class="explanations">Insurers choose the mortality table to use depending on the product type, the purpose of the calculation, the characteristics of the population being studied, and the availability of appropriate statistics based on insurer experience. Mortality tables can be very specific; they also frequently overlap. A single table might be classified as a select mortality table, sex-distinct mortality table, and valuation mortality table.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The use of principles-based reserving (PBR), in which actuarial assumptions and reserve levels change as risk factors change, favors proprietary mortality tables, as they better capture the risks specific to a company. Larger insurance companies are more likely to develop proprietary mortality tables than are smaller insurance companies.</p>

	<p class="explanations">People whose risk characteristics have been evaluated recently are likely to have better mortality risk characteristics during a specified select mortality period following the underwriting evaluation than do people who have not recently undergone an underwriting selection process. Better mortality risk characteristics for life insurance are risk characteristics that indicate lower mortality.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Insurers do not use the same sets of mortality data for life insurance as they use for annuities because life insureds and annuitants exhibit different mortality patterns.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">When life expectancy increases for the general population, or for a subset of the population, insurers experience a decrease in benefit costs for associated life insurance policies, but an increase in benefit costs for associated life annuities. The risk this trend poses for issuers of life annuities is sometimes called longevity risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers sometimes use different sets of mortality data for different products within a line of business and for different classes of underwriting risk within a product. For example, insurers often use lower mortality rates for individual annuities than they do for group annuities, because annuitants of individual annuities tend to live longer than do annuitants of group annuities.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Two simple methods for modifying tabular mortality rates to reflect mortality changes are the projection method and the setback method.

		<li>build an expected mortality margin into the premium for insureds age 46</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Tables that have been adjusted using the projection method to account for future changes in mortality are called mortality tables with projection. If an insurer expects people in the specified group to live longer than the tabular mortality rates indicate, the insurer would multiply the tabular rates by a factor less than 100 percent. If the insurer expects people in the specified group to die sooner than the tabular rates indicate, the insurer would multiply the tabular rates by a factor greater than 100 percent.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The setback method of adjusting tabular mortality rates consists of showing future decreases in mortality for people of a given age by using the tabular mortality rate for a younger age, typically values of one to five years younger. A larger age setback could distort the mortality curve.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Building an expected mortality margin into a product’s technical design may help the insurer meet its benefit obligations if actual mortality rates turn out to be different from what was expected. A positive mortality margin can be a source of company profits. For a life insurance death benefit, this results from applying a higher mortality rate than would be found in a basic mortality table. For a life annuity payout results, this results from applying a lower mortality rate than would be found in a basic mortality table.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Bren Gryce, an actuary at the Sumac Life Insurance Company, calculated the one-year annuity benefit cost for a single life annuity with a $10,000 yearly income payment issued to 71-year-old male annuitant. The tabular mortality rate indicates that the probability of an annuitant’s dying at age 71 is 0.0252. Ms.&#160;Gryce correctly determined that the one-year annuity benefit cost for this single life annuity is (<strong>$252 / $9,748</strong>). Ms.&#160;Gryce can build a mortality margin into this annuity product by applying a (<strong>lower / higher</strong>) mortality rate than would be found in a basic mortality table.</p>

		<li>$9,748 / higher</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">For a given age and cohort, the sum of the mortality rate and the survival rate always equals 1. If the probability of an annuitant’s dying at age 71 is 0.0252, then the probability of an annuitant’s surviving to age 72 is 1&#160;–&#160;0.0252 = 0.9748. Therefore, for a yearly income payment of $10,000, the one-year annuity benefit cost is $10,000&#160;×&#160;0.9748 = $9,748. Another way to calculate the one-year annuity benefit cost is to subtract the yearly income payment times the mortality rate from the yearly income payment: $10,000 – ($10,000 × 0.0252) = $9,748.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A positive mortality margin for a life annuity payout results from applying a lower mortality rate than would be found in a basic mortality table. The insurer assumes that more annuitants will survive to collect benefits, and prepares for potential low-mortality scenarios where its annuity cost of benefits is high.

	<p class="explanations">Insurers can use one of two cost accounting methods for life insurance and annuity products. Under full costing, or absorption costing, both direct and allocated indirect expenses are counted. Thus, full costing requires an insurer to allocate all operating expenses to each product line and potentially to eac &amp; bsp;product.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Marginal costing, or direct costing, is an accounting method for estimating product-related expenses in which only direct expenses are counted; indirect expenses are not allocated to products. Marginal costing generally produces a smaller operating expense estimate than full costing produces. To offset this difference, insurers typically set margins that are designed to cover contingencies.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A unit cost, which is the amount of incurred expense attributable to a single measured amount of product, is found by dividing the total relevant cost by the number of designated units of products. In this situation, the unit cost is calculated by adding employee-related expenses to other contract expenses, and then dividing that sum by the number of contracts issued: ($4,000,000 + $10,000,000) ÷ 50,000 = $280.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For expense control purposes, insurers divide operating expenses into controllable and noncontrollable expenses, direct and indirect expenses, and fixed and variable expenses.

A<em> </em>noncontrollable expense<em> </em>is a cost over which no specified manager or organizational unit has power or influence.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A direct expense, or traceable cost, is incurred for or physically traceable to a specified life insurance or annuity product. An indirect expense, or common cost, cannot be traced to or is not incurred for a specific product; this expense is incurred whether or not an insurer offers a specific product.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A<em> </em>fixed expense remains relatively constant regardless of the number of policies or contracts sold or the level of operating activity. A variable expense varies in direct proportion to some variation in a specified level of operatin &amp; bsp;activity. A typical expense falls into multiple categories. For example, the cost of product advertising is an acquisition expense, a controllable expense, a direct expense, and a variable expense. Direct expenses often are variable expenses and indirect expenses often are fixed expenses.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Renewal commissions are designed to encourage persistency by providing agents with a continuing stream of income from existing policies. The insurer benefits from steady premium income and less need to make surrender payments.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A vested commission is guaranteed payable to an agent whether or not the agent represents the company when the commission becomes due; a nonvested commission is payable only if the agent still represents the company when the commission becomes due. Under an asset-based commission schedule, at regular intervals—usually yearly—after premium payments stop, the agent receives a commission payment known as a trail commission.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Annuity commission schedules generally do not distinguish between first-year and renewal commissions, given that annuities usually feature large initial premiums and much smaller, if any, subsequent premiums. Most insurers today use a combination of deposit-based and asset-based commission schedules for annuity sales. Deposit-based commissions incentivize agents to generate ne &amp; bsp;business. Asset-based commissions incentivize agents to encourage contract owners to keep their contracts in force.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Deposit-based commission schedules pay commissions only on premium payments; the commission is calculated as a percentage of the annuity’s premium. Increasingly, more insurers offer asset-based commission schedules; the commission is a percentage of the accumulated value of a deferred annuity contract’s funds and is payable as long as the contract remains in force.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Traditionally, stochastic modeling is preferable if the underlying risks have the following characteristics: the volatility of the outcomes is unknown or high; a given risk is nondiversifiable; the future outcomes are likely to have a skewed distribution—that is, a skewed distribution or a “fat tail;” and the insurer lacks an appropriate hedge for a given product risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In the context of policyholder behavior, stochastic assumptions are useful when modeling products that contain nonguaranteed elements (NGEs). In life insurance and annuities, NGEs are product features that allow an insurer to reward customers when the insurer has experienced or anticipates it will experience favorable deviations from its assumptions, and to charge customers more when the insurer has experienced or anticipates it will experience unfavorable deviations from its assumptions.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To help protect against potential losses from adverse deviations from expense projections, insurers may base their expense charges on the results of pessimistic scenarios.

	<p class="explanations">For universal life products, insurers typically calculate administrative charges as a flat amount per month based on the units of coverage. Administrative charges also can be calculated as a percentage of premium per period. For fixed immediate annuities, insurers factor administrative charges into the single premium payment. In fixed-rate deferred annuities, the interest spread covers applicable administrative expenses.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Transaction charges include sales charges and surrender charges. For fixed insurance products, sales charges typically are calculated as either a flat amount per transaction or a percentage of the amount of the transaction. Very few fixed-rate deferred annuities offered today assess sales charges.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers use surrender charges to provide protection against surrender and withdrawal rates that exceed projections. For both fixed life insurance products and fixed-rate deferred annuities, surrender charges are a specified percentage of the amount received when the policy or contract is surrendered.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Transaction charges for variable products can be divided into three categories: sales charges, transfer charges, and surrender charges. Variable life insurance products generally include back-end sales charges. A back-end sales charge is a sales charge assessed when an investor sells a security. In the context of variable life insurance and annuity products, the securities sold are typically shares in a subaccount fund. Back-end sales charges are calculated as a percentage of the amount sold.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For variable annuity products, sales charges may be either front-end sales charges or, more commonly, back-end sales charges. A front-end sales charge is a one-time transaction charge imposed when an investor purchases shares in a subaccount. Front-end sales charges generally are calculated as a percentage of the amount invested.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Most insurers allow owners of variable contracts to transfer funds from one subaccount to another without charge, as long as the transfers fall within specified limits, such as amount or frequency. Transfer charges apply to transfers that exceed these limits. Surrender charges on variable products are designed to cover the costs of selling or redeeming fund shares to cover withdrawals or surrenders and are similar to the surrender charges assessed for fixed products.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To address specific risks associated with variable deferred annuities, insurers have adjusted product designs in ways such as imposing restrictions on the kinds of investments that contract owners can select, requiring waiting periods before a contract owner can begin withdrawing guaranteed income from the contract, and using index-based guarantees, which help reduce an insurer’s capital market risk.</p>
