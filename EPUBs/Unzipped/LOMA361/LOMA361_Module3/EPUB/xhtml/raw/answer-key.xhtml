<p class="q-feedback" id="loma361-ch12-p-102">The rate variance was ($39 – $40) x 950 claims processed, or $(950).

	<p class="q-stem-static">The exact classification of responsibility centers varies from company to company, but in general, responsibility centers take four specific forms: cost centers, revenue centers, profit centers, and investment centers. Of these centers, the type(s) of centers in which a responsibility manager has control over <em>both</em> costs (expenses) and revenues associated with the center include</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A profit center is a department or other business segment to which both costs (expenses) and revenues can be traced. An investment center is a department or division to which costs (expenses), revenues, and capital or investment funds can be traced. Responsibility managers have control over both costs (expenses) and revenues associated with the center in a profit center and in an investment center.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A cost center is a department or division to which costs (expenses) can be traced; however, cost centers do not directly generate or control revenues. Similarly, a revenue center is a department or division to which revenues can be traced; revenue centers do not directly control costs (expenses).</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">To establish and evaluate distinct responsibility centers, a company must be able to separate a responsibility center’s expenses into (1) controllable costs and noncontrollable costs and (2) direct costs and indirect costs. A responsibility manager in an insurer’s underwriting department is considering two costs: the cost of a wellness program that the insurer has made available to all company employees, and the cost of overtime pay within the underwriting department. From the perspective of this responsibility manager, the cost of the wellness program for all company employees most likely would be classified as both a</p>

		<li>noncontrollable cost and an indirect cost, and the cost of overtime pay within the underwriting department also would be classified as a noncontrollable cost and an indirect cost</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A controllable cost is a cost over which a responsibility manager has decision-making authority. For example, the costs of supplies, travel, and overtime pay are controllable costs within a department because the responsibility manager can decide whether or not these costs should be incurred.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A direct cost is identified specifically with a single cost object. A cost object is any purpose for which a company measures costs. Sample cost objects include product lines, employee salaries, customer service, and so on. A simple way to determine whether a cost is a direct cost of a specified cost object is to ask: Would the cost disappear if the cost object disappeared? If the answer is yes, then the cost is a direct cost.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A product’s rate variance is the difference between the product’s actual rate (or unit cost or unit price) and the standard rate budgeted for that product, multiplied by the actual number of units sold or processed: Rate variance = (Actual rate – Standard rate) × Actual number of units sold or processed. Indigo’s rate variance is calculated as ($22 – $25), multiplied by 2,500 policies issued, which is equal to –&amp;nbsp;$7,500. The rate variance is negative and favorable because Indigo’s actual cost is lower than its budgeted cost.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A product’s usage variance is the difference between the actual quantities sold or processed and the budgeted (standard) quantities to be sold or processed, multiplied by the standard rate or unit cost: Usage variance = (Actual quantities sold or processed – Standard quantities sold or processed) × Standard rate. Indigo’s usage variance is calculated as (2,500 – 2,300) multiplied by $25, which is equal to $5,000. The usage variance is positive and unfavorable because Indigo processed 200 more policies than budgeted.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Total variance = Rate variance + Usage variance. In this situation, Indigo’s –$2,500 negative favorable total variance is calculated by adding the negative favorable rate variance of –&amp;nbsp;$7,500 [($22 – $25) × 2,500] to the positive unfavorable usage variance of $5,000 [(2,500 – 2,300) × $25].</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">An indirect cost is a cost that cannot be identified specifically with a single cost object. A noncontrollable cost is a cost over which an individual responsibility manager has no decision-making authority. For example, to a company’s line of business, home office rent typically is classified as an indirect, noncontrollable cost. However, to the company’s CEO, home office rent typically is classified as a direct, controllable cost.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Cost A describes a marginal cost, which a company incurs after all fixed costs applicable to a product or service have already been accounted for; therefore, marginal costs are always variable costs. Marginal costs measure the additional total expense of increased volume of an already existing product or service: Marginal Cost = Change in Costs ÷ Additional Units Produced. Unlike marginal costs, differential costs measure the expected increase or decrease in cost for undertaking a new product or service.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Cost B describes an opportunity cost, which is associated with all out-of-pocket costs—which require outlays of cash or other resources. A sunk cost is an actual financial cost that the company has already incurred. However, an opportunity cost may or may not yet be incurred. A company estimates its opportunity costs because they are not known in advance. The company’s accounting system does not capture the financial impact of opportunity costs because these costs are not actual, objective costs, and no transactions are involved. Thus, the company’s financial statements do not include opportunity costs.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The behavior of a cost describes how the cost changes with time and volume. A fixed cost remains constant for all levels of operating activity or production. A variable cost changes in direct response to changes in the level of operating activity.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A semi-variable cost, also called a mixed cost, includes a fixed cost component plus the amount of a variable component over time and at each volume level. Other examples of semi-variable costs include the costs for heat, repairs, telephone, and building maintenance.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Unit costs can be established for direct and indirect expenses and for fixed and variable expenses. The formula is the same: Unit cost = Total cost ÷ Number of units. Managers typically use unit costs to evaluate or adjust a product’s profitability. Normally, as production volume or the amount of activity increases, unit costs decrease.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">When accumulating costs by line of business, an insurer identifies all costs that are directly attributable to a particular line and charges these costs to that line. When accumulating costs by department or cost center, insurers consolidate department costs at one level into the department costs at the next higher level in the company.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A company accumulates costs by type without regard to the specified area of the company that incurs the expense. This method enables companies to satisfy financial reporting requirements. To accumulate costs by function, an insurer directs the costs to the company operation that generates the costs.

	<p class="explanations">A department that engages in an insurance company’s revenue-generating activities is often called an operating department or a production department. An insurer’s operating departments provide products and services directly to and for the insurer’s external customers in order to generate revenue for the insurer. Typical operating departments in an insurance company include claims administration, policy issue, policyowner service, premium collection, sales, and underwriting. All costs incurred by an operating department are direct costs because they are directly traceable to a specific product.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A service department provides support services to operating departments and to other service departments, but it does not generate revenue. An insurer’s service departments provide products and services for the insurer’s internal customers, including its operating departments and other service departments, but not directly to the insurer’s external customers. Other examples of service departments include accounting, human resources, information technology, legal, and marketing.

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>comparing the financial statements of one company to the financial statements of other companies in the industry in relative terms rather than in absolute terms</li>
		<li>using percentages, not amounts, to relate each financial statement item to a “common size” item, such as total assets or total liabilities, on the financial statement</li>
		<li>identifying the practices and the best outcomes that other companies have achieved for a specific process and implementing those practices to surpass the best outcomes</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">In comparative analysis, an insurer analyzes the change in an item over two or more accounting periods (horizontal analysis), or compares two sets of numbers that reflect company operations during the same accounting period (vertical analysis). To achieve the most meaningful results, an insurer typically uses both forms of analysis in tandem. Horizontal analysis uses comparative financial statements, which present data for two or more accounting periods side by side. Horizontal analysis can be applied to any financial statement.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Vertical analysis provides additional context for the figures on a financial statement, making it easier for managers to determine if an amount represents a particular strength of the company or if it indicates a potential cause for concern. Although vertical analysis can be applied to many financial statements, insurers typically conduct vertical analysis on the balance sheet and the income statement.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>A <em>horizontal analysis </em>of this information indicates that, in 2018, Rey’s cash represented 40% of its total assets.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />A <em>horizontal analysis </em>of this information indicates that Rey experienced a 10.34% increase in cash from 2017 to 2018.</li>
		<li>A <em>vertical analysis </em>of this information indicates that, in 2017, Rey’s cash represented 90.6% of its total assets.</li>
		<li>A <em>vertical analysis </em>of this information indicates that Rey experienced a 37.5% increase in total assets from 2017 to 2018.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The financial reporting period chosen as the reference point for horizontal analysis is known as the base period, which could be a specific month, quarter, year, or other appropriate period. In most cases, the base period is the earliest period. For truly accurate analysis, a company must be sure it is including identical categories for analysis in each period. A category that is present in one period and absent in another can weight the findings, which makes the analysis less accurate and useful.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To calculate the absolute monetary amount of the change being analyzed, subtract the base period amount from the amount of the period under study. To calculate the percentage change, divide the absolute monetary amount by the base period amount; then multiply the result by 100.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, Rey’s base period is 2017. The absolute amount of the change in cash from 2017 to 2018 is equal to ($800,000 – $725,000) = $75,000. The percentage change in cash from 2017 to 2018 is equal to ($75,000 ÷ $725,000) × 100 = 10.34%. The absolute amount of change in total assets from 2017 to 2018 is equal to ($2,000,000 – $1,800,000) = $200,000. The percentage change in total assets from 2017 to 2018 is equal to ($200,000 ÷ $1,800,000) × 100 = 11.11%.</p>

		<li>trend velocity for premium income is more gradual than the trend velocity for benefits paid</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A trend is a consistent pattern of change displayed over time. Trend analysis, also called trend percentages or index-number trend analysis, is a specific type of horizontal analysis that involves calculating percentage changes in financial statement items over several successive accounting periods, rather than over just two periods. Comparative financial statements indicate the direction and velocity of trends. Direction refers to whether a trend displays an increase or decrease in an account. Velocity refers to whether the increase or decrease in an account is gradual or rapid.</p>

	<p class="explanations">To conduct trend analysis, use the following procedure. (1) Select a base period. In this situation, Year 1 would be the base period—that is, the year to which you would compare all other years. (2) List all the amounts in the base period as 100. Each 100 represents 100 percent and is an index number. An index number is a statistical method for measuring the change in a variable. (3) Express each corresponding amount from nonbase years as a percentage of the applicable base year amount. Note that index numbers can be calculated only when the amounts are positive.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, Valiant’s premium income index numbers are 100, 125, 160, and 180 and its benefits paid index numbers are 100, 110, 120, and 130. For example, to calculate the benefits paid index number in Year&#160;2, divide the difference between benefits paid in Year&#160;1 and Year&#160;2 by the benefits paid in Year&#160;1 (the base year), then multiply the result by 100: ($825 – $750) ÷ $750 × 100 = 110. Because yearly premium income increases are greater than yearly benefits paid increases, the trend velocity for premium income is less<strong> </strong>gradual than the trend velocity for benefits paid.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The following statements are about activity-based costing (ABC). Select the answer choice containing the correct statement.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>One limitation of ABC is that it typically results in less effective cost control than under traditional cost accounting systems.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />ABC provides a solid basis for assigning costs to products and assists management in identifying non-value-added activities.</li>
		<li>Accumulated cost data obtained under ABC tends to be lower than the same cost data accumulated under traditional costing systems.</li>
		<li>ABC differs from traditional cost accounting systems in that traditional cost accounting systems assume that activities generate costs, whereas ABC assumes that products generate costs.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">ABC uses special terminology. An activity driver is the output of an activity being performed. For example, investigating a claim is an activity for an insurer, and a processed claim is an activity driver. An activity cost is the cost attributable to a specified activity.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A value-added activity makes the product more valuable to the customer. A company typically can pass costs associated with value-added activities through to a company’s customers in the form of higher prices. A non-value-added activity does not make the product or service more valuable to the customer. A company typically minimizes non-value-added activities, which do not generate profits.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The primary benefits of ABC are that it provides a solid basis for assigning costs to products and assists management in identifying non-value-added activities. By identifying the specific costs of performing tasks and activities, management can determine the relationship between costs and products. The intended result of ABC is more accurate pricing and more effective cost control.</p>

		<li>Total variable costs = $5,000,000</li>
		<li>Total fixed costs = $3,000,000</li>
		<li>Total units sold = 1,000,000</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">With regard to the contribution margin and breakeven point on the new term life insurance policy, Encore’s revenue and cost data indicate that the policy’s total contribution margin is equal to</p>

		<li>$3,000,000 and the policy is above its breakeven point</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Fundamental to cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis is the concept of contribution margin, which is the difference between a product’s total revenues and its total variable costs. To calculate a product’s contribution margin, an insurer must separate the product’s fixed costs—such as rent, utilities, and some employee salaries—from its variable costs, such as agent commissions and operating expenses. In this situation, the contribution margin on Encore’s new term life insurance product is equal to $3,000,000, calculated as $8,000,000 total product sales revenues – $5,000,000 total product variable costs.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The point at which a product’s revenues are equal to its costs (expenses) is the breakeven point—the product generates no profit and no loss at this point. By calculating the breakeven point, a manager can determine the level of sales at which the product will produce a net gain. One way to calculate the breakeven point is Fixed Costs ÷ (Unit Selling Price – Unit Variable Cost). In this situation, the breakeven point on Encore’s new term life insurance product is equal to 1,000,000 units, calculated as ($8,000,000&#160;– $5,000,000 ÷ [($8,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000) – ($5,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000)].</p>

	<p class="explanations">An insurer can determine which activities are contributing the most to net gain by calculating the segment margin for various segments—such as a specific annuity product or the group life insurance line of business—of each profit center.

	<p class="explanations">A segment margin indicates the segment’s profitability.

	<p class="q-stem-static">Most companies prefer to use one or more of the following approaches to the budgeting process: top-down budgeting, bottom-up budgeting, zero-based budgeting, and activity-based budgeting. In a comparison of top-up budgeting and bottom -down budgeting, it is correct to say that</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>top-down budgeting takes considerably more time to prepare than does bottom-up budgeting</li>
		<li>top-down budgeting typically has more grassroots support among company employees than does bottom-up budgeting</li>
		<li>bottom-up budgeting is more likely to reflect top management’s intentions for the company than is top-down budgeting</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Top-down budgeting begins with a company’s senior management and is passed down to lower-level management. Senior management bases a top-down budget’s monetary amounts both on the strategic plan and on financial information about the company’s activities in prior years.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Bottom-up budgeting starts at the bottom of a company, with lower-level managers generating budgets for their areas, which they then present in the form of recommendations to senior management. Bottom-up budgets reflect the input and participation of the area managers and employees who will be responsible for achieving the company’s goals.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Compared to top-down budgeting, bottom-up budgeting typically takes more time and includes a larger number of employees, is more likely to reflect the realities of the company’s core business operations, and often has more grassroots support among company employees.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under ZBB, a company allocates resources only if expense amounts are linked to the company’s strategic and operational goals. ZBB generally applies only to a company’s expense budgets. Many companies use a modified ZBB process.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Unlike the top-down and bottom-up budgeting approaches, ZBB does not automatically assume that current-year expense levels are reasonable starting points for developing the expense budget for the next accounting period. In other words, planners must begin each accounting period at “zero.” For every accounting period, each responsibility center must justify its continued existence and operation.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A flexible budget, also known as a flexible-amount budget, a dynamic budget, or a variable budget, commonly focuses on the company’s projections for the best-case, worst-case, and expected levels of activity. The amounts in a static budget, also known as a fixed or a fixed-amount budget, are generally not subject to change unless management has approved the changes.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A period budget—which may be short-term or long-term—covers a specific time frame, and expires at the end of that time frame. A short-term budget, also called an operating budget, generally covers a period of one year or less and relates mainly to a company’s operations during that period. A long-term budget, also called a strategic budget, generally covers periods of more than one year.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">An operational budget covers part or all of a company’s core business operations, such as underwriting and claims. Two basic types of operational budgets are revenue budgets and expense budgets. An expense budget is a schedule of expenses expected during an accounting period. Common components of the expense budget for insurance companies include the benefits budget, the sales expense budget, and the general and administrative expense budget.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The sales expense budget indicates the costs incurred—commissions, advertising, promotions, travel, branch office operations, and salaries for marketing staff—in selling insurance. Most expenses in benefits and sales expense budgets are variable expenses, because these expenses vary with changes in sales volume. The general and administrative expense budget includes expenses—typically fixed expenses—needed for insurance company operations, such as administrative salaries, rent, and utilities.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A cash budget projects a company’s beginning cash balance, cash inflows, cash outflows, and ending cash balance for a specified accounting period, typically by quarter. A cash budget consists of a cash receipts budget (cash inflows) and a cash disbursements budget (cash outflows).</p>

	<p class="explanations">Information contained in the cash budget includes the beginning cash balance; available cash for the period; minimum cash balance; cash needed for the period; excess cash or cash shortage; amount of any cash borrowed or repaid, including interest; and the ending cash balance. The minimum cash balance is the amount of cash that a company determines is necessary to pay all obligations in an accounting period without having excess cash.</p>

		<li>an estimate of the expected amount of investment income of bonds, stocks, mortgages, and other invested assets that a company owns</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">In the context of capital budgeting, the word “investment” typically does not refer to the direct purchase of bonds, mortgages, or stocks. Rather, these long-term, high-cost investments include: new investments in equipment or real estate; remodeling of or major repairs to existing capital investments; acquisitions of other companies or lines of business; mandated safety and environmental improvements; expense reduction projects; purchases of new computer systems and equipment; and revenue expansion projects. A common trait of capital budgeting is that these investments are expected to produce income or other benefits for more than one year.</p>

	<div class="pq-container-static" data-type="mc" epub:type="footnote" id="LOMA_361_PQ_129-key" role="doc-footnote">
	<p class="q-stem-static">Two key aspects of the control function that directly affect all insurance operations are internal control and financial auditing. <em>Internal control</em> is a process in which an insurance company takes actions, including those designed to</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Monitor the reliability of its accounting records</li>
		<li>Protect its assets</li>
	</ol>

		<li>A only</li>
		<li>B only</li>
		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">All insurers have a control function, which measures and monitors an insurer’s transactions as it pursues its corporate objectives, such as solvency and profitability. The activities associated with accounting and financial reporting are an integral part of this control function, which consists of two key aspects: internal control and financial auditing.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Internal controls are the steps a company takes to protect its assets, monitor the accuracy of its accounting records, encourage both operational efficiency and adherence to the company’s management policies, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Internal controls are designed to prevent or reduce losses arising from unexpected events or contingencies and mistakes or irregularities in transaction processing and asset handling.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 16A. Explain the purpose of internal control and differentiate between preventive controls and detective controls.</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">An insurer’s internal controls should include both preventive controls and detective controls. One example of an insurer’s <em>preventive </em>controls is a</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>daily review of reports of questionable data</li>
		<li>monthly review of claims disbursements</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />valid code to be entered for each transaction</li>
		<li>daily balance of department accounts</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A preventive control is designed to keep an error or a problem from occurring. Normally, preventive controls involve steps that must be taken before a business transaction occurs. Preventive controls in insurance companies include internal procedures that require proper documentation and two signatures on checks written over a specified dollar amount before claims processors disburse benefit payments.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A detective control identifies an error or a problem after it has occurred. Most detective controls are undertaken after a series of business transactions. Detective controls in insurance companies include internal procedures such as a daily review of reports of questionable data, a daily balance of department accounts, and a monthly review of claims disbursements.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Preventive controls are usually more effective at reducing errors or problems than are detective controls, but preventive controls are also typically more expensive. Insurers analyze both preventive and detective controls to ensure that they provide benefits that are worth their costs.</p>

		<li>maintenance of written recovery plans and off-premises storage of back-up files for all critical records in case of a business disaster</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The principle of segregation of duties, also known as the principle of dual control, requires an employer to design jobs so that incompatible functions are assigned to different individuals, who typically work in different areas or functions of the company. In this context, incompatible functions are job duties that, when combined, place an employee in a position to commit an illegal act or to conceal errors or irregularities in the normal course of his or her employment.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">As part of its system of internal controls, the Domain Life Insurance Company numbers all policy applications and claims as they are received.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Prenumbering is one example of the internal control known as the physical comparison of recorded amounts, in which a company counts its assets on a periodic basis and compares this count to the amounts in its accounting records. Prenumbering includes printing checks and purchase orders with sequential numbers, numbering policy applications and claims as they are received, and having internal auditors check the numbering sequence and reconcile any number that is missing or out of sequence.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Other examples of the physical comparison of recorded amounts include inventory; approval, review, checking, and recalculation (claim payments); maintenance of control totals (policy loans, premium checks); comparison with third-party information (cash receipts, cash disbursements); document cancellation (void, shred); and timeliness of operation (transactions, policy application status).</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">All insurance companies undergo periodic internal and external accounting audits and examinations. The following statement(s) can correctly be made about these audits and examinations:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>That all U.S. insurance companies must undergo periodic financial condition examinations, which are a type of internal audit</li>

		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. All U.S. insurance companies undergo periodic financial condition examinations, which are a specific type of external audit. An external audit, also known as an independent audit, is a financial audit performed by external auditors, who are employed by public accounting companies, insurance regulators, or reinsurers.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. An internal audit is a financial audit performed by company employees. Internal auditors should not directly supervise or report to the areas they audit. Internal auditors usually report to a senior-level executive or to the audit committee of the insurer’s board of directors.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">One type of auditor’s opinion that an insurer may receive indicates that the insurer’s financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the insurer in conformity with GAAP or, for “special purpose” financial statements, in accordance with statutory accounting principles (SAP). This type of auditor’s opinion is known as</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>a qualified opinion</li>
		<li>a modified opinion</li>
		<li>an adverse opinion</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">External auditors prepare and sign the auditor’s opinion or report, which is included in a company’s Annual Report. An auditor’s opinion is a statement, prepared by a public accounting company, that indicates (1) whether the information contained in an insurer’s Annual Report fairly represents the insurer’s financial position, the results of its operations, and its cash flows and (2) whether the audit was conducted in accordance with applicable auditing standards. An auditor’s opinion does not, however, guarantee the accuracy of the financial statements.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Depending on the results of the audit, auditors issue one of several different types of auditor’s opinions. Types of auditor’s opinions include unqualified opinions and modified opinions. An unqualified opinion, also called a standard report or clean opinion, is the type of auditor’s opinion that companies prefer. An unqualified opinion with explanatory language, which is another type of unqualified opinion, contains explanatory language concerning specific circumstances, such as material inconsistencies resulting from a change in accounting principles. Types of modified opinions include a qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, and a disclaimer of opinion. In the insurance industry, a disclaimer of opinion is extremely rare.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">A government regulatory authority is examining the Sidereal Life Insurance Company to determine whether Sidereal’s financial statements adhere to the laws, regulations, policies, and procedures prescribed by internal and external regulatory authorities.

		<li>financial audit</li>
		<li>performance audit</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A financial audit verifies that a company’s assets are accounted for and that they are safeguarded from loss; assesses the soundness and the application of the company’s administrative and accounting controls; ensures that employees follow specified policies and procedures; verifies the reliability of the company’s accounting records and financial reports; and evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of operating procedures. Financial audits also uncover unintentional errors, false information, fraud, or collusion.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Other important types of audits are compliance audits and performance audits. All three types of audits can be conducted on either an internal or external basis. Compliance auditing focuses on the market conduct of an insurer’s producers. External auditors in the United States use specified guidelines in conducting compliance audits.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, two important regulations that govern an insurer’s internal control and auditing activities are the:</p>

	<ul class="examul">
		<li>Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX</li>
		<li>NAIC’s Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation, also known as the <em>Model Audit Rule</em></li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">One characteristic about these important regulations is that</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>SOX applies to all stock, mutual, and fraternal insurance companies</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />SOX requires a stock insurer’s chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) to certify the accuracy of its financial statements</li>
		<li>the NAIC’s <em>Model Audit Rule</em> applies only to small life insurers</li>
		<li>the NAIC’s <em>Model Audit Rule</em> does not require an insurer to disclose material weaknesses noted during the course of the audit</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under SOX, a stock insurer’s CEO and CFO are required to attest to the accuracy of the insurer’s financial statements. In addition, a stock insurer must select an internal control framework—in this context, a system of principles and components designed to aid an organization in achieving certain objectives—and assess and report on the design and operating effectiveness of the insurer’s internal controls annually. In the United States, the most popular internal control framework was developed by the <em>Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission</em>, known as <em>COSO</em>.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The NAIC’s Model Regulation requires that insurers file an annual audit and two specific reports with the appropriate state insurance commissioner. The annual audit must be prepared by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) and must be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). In the report called <em>Communication of Internal Control Related to Matters Noted in the Audit</em>, the CPA describes any uncorrected material weaknesses in internal controls that might lead to material misstatements in the financial statements during the course of the audit.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The report called <em>Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</em> includes a statement that the insurer’s internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the company’s financial statements. SOX requires stock insurers to prepare a comparable report. Therefore, stock insurers are permitted to use this report to satisfy this requirement of the Model Regulation.</p>
