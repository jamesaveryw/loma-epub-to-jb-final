<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch15-h2-4">Why Budget?</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch15-p-24">No company has infinite resources. Therefore, all companies budget to varying degrees. The budgeting process enables a company to</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch15-ul-6">
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-24">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-25"><em>Communicate information throughout the company</em>. A company budget contains information on the company’s financial position, resources, and expenses. Also, because a budget is a formalized plan, employees can use the budget to understand what actions management plans to take, and the reasons for taking those actions.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-25">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-26"><em>Allocate scarce resources effectively</em>. A company must distinguish between wants and needs, and allocate resources accordingly. A budget helps a company prioritize expenses that are essential for the company to remain in operation. Once the company has accounted for all essential operating expenses, the company can allocate any remaining resources to other expenses.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-26">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-27"><em>Control and reduce expenses</em>. A budget shows a company’s expenses side by side, thereby enabling management to compare expenses between operational areas or between time periods. By doing so, a company can determine which costs take precedence and which costs it can more easily reduce.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-27">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-28"><em>Prioritize necessary technological improvements</em>. Technology changes rapidly, whether a company is ready for it or not. A budget helps determine which upgrades a company cannot afford—and which upgrades a company cannot afford to do without.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-28">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-29"><em>Monitor and evaluate ongoing operations</em>. A budget provides the context necessary to determine if a business operation is doing well or poorly. Management achieves this goal by measuring the operation against the budget to see if the operation is meeting expectations.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-29">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-30"><em>Evaluate managerial performance</em>. Accurate budgets indicate how well company managers are achieving the company’s goals or meeting company expectations.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-30">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-31"><em>Motivate employees</em>. Managers can recognize and reward employees who meet or exceed the expectations laid out in the budget. In addition, employees are more confident when they understand and agree with their company’s plan of action. However, employees should agree that a budget is realistic. If a budget is unrealistic, employees may feel the company is destined to fail.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-32">We can see that the advantages of budgeting are clear. However, budgeting also has some possible disadvantages, including the potential for management to</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch15-ul-7">
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-31">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-33"><em>Consume too much time</em>. Budgeting takes time. If management devotes too much time to creating and monitoring a budget, then the reduced time available for other managerial duties may lead to a loss of productivity or company focus.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-32">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-34"><em>Spend unnecessary amounts</em>. Management may be tempted to consider the resources set aside to cover budgeted costs as “money already spent.” Management might also anticipate that their budgets will be reduced in the future if they do not use all the resources allocated to them. Therefore, they may feel compelled to spend the entire budgeted amount, even when some expenditures prove to be unnecessary.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-33">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-35"><em>Overestimate costs</em>. Managers may be tempted to overestimate costs so that if they overspend, upper management will not blame them for contributing to a loss. This phenomenon makes accurate budgeting much more difficult.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-34">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-36"><em>Avoid innovation</em>. With a strict budget in place, managers may be less inclined to experiment, especially in response to changing market conditions. While this conservative approach expends fewer resources, it also may prevent a company from discovering innovative solutions.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-35">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-37"><em>Disregard quality and customer service</em>. Budgetary constraints may tempt managers to focus on volume over quality, or on gaining new customers at the expense of retaining existing customers. These choices may result in increasing numbers of dissatisfied customers who take their business elsewhere.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-38">With all of these advantages and disadvantages to consider, the budgeting process requires careful planning and execution to be successful. In many companies, a budget committee formed by top executives and managers from the company’s main functions oversees the budgeting process. The budget committee reviews proposed budgets and works to integrate responsibility center budgets into a balanced, realistic main budget.</p>
