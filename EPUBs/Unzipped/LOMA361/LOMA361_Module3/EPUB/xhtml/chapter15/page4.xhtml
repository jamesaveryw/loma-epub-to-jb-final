<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch15-h2-5">Budgeting Approaches</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch15-p-39">A company carefully selects an approach to the budgeting process to ensure that the budget supports the attainment of company goals. For example, if management has set a goal of increasing employee confidence in the company, the company may choose a budgeting approach that increases employee involvement in the budgeting process. Most companies prefer to use one or more of the following approaches: top-down budgeting, bottom-up budgeting, zero-based budgeting, and activity-based budgeting.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch15-div-10">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma361-ch15-h3-1">Top-Down Budgeting and Bottom-Up Budgeting</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch15-p-40"><span class="gt" data-term="ch15-gt-topdownbudgeting" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch15-span-6" role="doc-glossref">Top-down budgeting</span> is a method for developing a budget that begins with a company’s senior management and is passed down to lower-level management. Senior management bases a top-down budget’s monetary amounts both on the strategic plan and on financial information about the company’s activities in prior years. In contrast, <span class="gt" data-term="ch15-gt-bottomupbudgeting" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch15-span-7" role="doc-glossref">bottom-up budgeting</span> starts at the bottom of a company, with lower-level managers generating budgets for their areas, which they then present in the form of recommendations to senior management. Bottom-up budgets reflect the input and participation of the area managers and employees who will be responsible for achieving the company’s goals.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-41">Compared to top-down budgeting, bottom-up budgeting</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch15-ul-8">
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-36">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-42">Typically takes more time and includes a larger number of employees</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-37">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-43">Is more likely to reflect the realities of the company’s core business operations</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-38">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-44">Often has more grassroots support among company employees</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-45">In practice, a company typically uses some elements of both top-down and bottom-up budgeting. For example, senior management must still ensure that a bottom-up budget adheres to overall corporate objectives. Many companies combine both approaches by using a <em>group decision method</em>, in which senior management works with the company’s responsibility managers. This method is time-consuming, but otherwise incorporates many advantages of both top-down and bottom-up budgeting. Figure 15.1 contrasts top-down and bottom-up budgeting.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch15-h3-2">Zero-Based Budgeting</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch15-p-47">Despite their differences, both top-down and bottom-up budgeting typically use the current year’s budget, along with actual financial results and strategic plans, as a starting point for making adjustments to the next year’s budget. In addition, these budgeting approaches apply to both revenue and expense budgets, which we describe in a later section. Zero-based budgeting, however, does not start with the current year’s budget, and generally applies only to a company’s expense budgets. Under <span class="gt" data-term="ch15-gt-zerobasedbudgeting" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch15-span-10" role="doc-glossref">zero-based budgeting (ZBB)</span>, a company treats each activity as though it were a new project and allocates resources only if planners can link expense amounts to the company’s strategic and operational goals. In other words, planners must begin each accounting period at “zero.” For every accounting period, each responsibility center must justify its continued existence and operation.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-48">In essence, ZBB treats each activity and function as though it were a new project under consideration. Unlike the top-down and bottom-up budgeting approaches, ZBB does not automatically assume that current-year expense levels are reasonable starting points for developing the expense budget for the next accounting period. Instead, ZBB imposes cost analysis on all levels of management to evaluate each activity in terms of efficiency and need. The advantages of ZBB include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch15-ul-9">
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-39">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-49"><em>Key roles for lower-level employees</em>. The company often calls upon lower-level employees to provide details that help the company assess the importance and financial requirements of each activity. This aspect of ZBB can improve communication and trust within a company, and usually offers the benefit of additional training and education for employees who participate.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-40">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-50"><em>Breadth and quality of financial information</em>. ZBB is an exacting process, which requires managers to identify required resources and an absolute minimum level of spending to operate.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-41">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-51"><em>Drive for improvement</em>. Every manager must consider and evaluate a level of spending lower than the current operating level. This feature of ZBB encourages managers to ask vital questions, rather than remaining complacent.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-52">Like other budgeting approaches, ZBB also has its disadvantages, which include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch15-ul-10">
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-42">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-53"><em>Cost</em>. ZBB is a complicated budgeting system that requires a significant investment of resources.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-43">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-54"><em>Time</em>. Managers at all levels of the company must help prepare and administer a zero-based budget. Much of the work associated with ZBB involves (1) collecting and analyzing data to justify each item and (2) preparing contingency budgets in case unanticipated expenses arise.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-44">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-55"><em>Risk of self-interest</em>. ZBB requires managers to rank projects or activities as necessary or desirable. This aspect of ZBB may create temptation for managers to overstate the amount of resources required for activities or products.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-56">Because of these disadvantages, many companies use a modified ZBB process. For example, one company might apply ZBB to specified activities or functions, while another company performs ZBB only every other year.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch15-div-14">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma361-ch15-h3-3">Activity-Based Budgeting</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch15-p-57">Another comprehensive budgeting approach relies on activity-based costing. Recall from Chapter 14 that <em>activity-based costing (ABC)</em> assigns costs based on the activities performed in producing products or services. Therefore, <span class="gt" data-term="ch15-gt-activitybasedbudgeting" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch15-span-11" role="doc-glossref">activity-based budgeting (ABB)</span> begins with the premise that costs are linked to products or services based on the activities performed in producing the products or services. The focus of ABB is to create a plan of action based on which activities are most cost-efficient.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-58">ABB’s advantages include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch15-ul-11">
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-45">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-59"><em>Detailed information.</em> Because the ABC process is exacting, ABB helps a company to anticipate and control costs in great detail. For instance, ABB is very effective at distinguishing between direct and indirect costs.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch15-li-46">
	<p id="loma361-ch15-p-60"><em>A focus on efficiency</em>. ABB is particularly useful when a company’s main goal is reducing unnecessary expenses and focusing on cost-efficient products and services.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch15-p-61">ABB also has its disadvantages, which are tied to the demands of the ABC process. Specifically, ABB requires more information and time than do other forms of budgeting, and is therefore comparably more expensive.</p>
