<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch16-h2-6">Regulations on Internal Control and Auditing</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-201">In the United States, two important regulations that govern an insurer’s internal control and auditing activities are</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch16-ul-18">
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-68">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-202"><em>The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</em>, or <em>SOX</em>, which applies only to life insurers that are public companies, or stock insurers</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch16-h3-8">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-204">Recall from Chapter 1 that <em>SOX</em> is a U.S. federal law that requires public companies to take specific precautions to prevent fraudulent behavior on the part of management and the company’s external auditors. The Act focuses specifically on internal control and reporting and more stringent requirements for external auditor independence. According to SOX, each stock insurer in the United States must</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch16-ul-19">
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-70">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-205">Contract with independent external auditors—typically a public accounting firm—to perform an annual audit of the financial information included in the insurer’s Annual Report.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-71">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-206">Ensure that its chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) certify the accuracy of its financial statements. Notice the difference here between what external auditors do and what SOX requires of CEOs and CFOs: whereas external auditors do not express an opinion as to the accuracy of an insurer’s financial statements, a stock insurer’s CEO and CFO are required to attest to the accuracy of the insurer’s financial statements.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-72">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-207">Have a “financial expert” on the audit committee of the board of directors and disclose information about this expert in the Annual Report.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-73">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-208">Select an internal control framework and assess and report on the design and operating effectiveness of the insurer’s internal controls annually. In this context, the term <em>framework </em>refers to a system of principles and components designed to aid an organization in achieving certain objectives. In the United States, the most popular internal control framework was developed by the <em>Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission</em>, known as <em>COSO</em>. The insight below discusses COSO frameworks.</p>

<p class="insight-title" id="loma361-ch16-p-210">COSO Frameworks</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch16-p-211"><em>COSO</em> is a private-sector initiative dedicated to improving organizational performance and governance through effective internal control, enterprise risk management, and fraud deterrence. COSO’s two frameworks are</p>

<ul id="loma361-ch16-ul-20">
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-74">COSO’s <em>Internal Control—Integrated Framework</em>, commonly known as the <em>COSO framework</em>, which, as noted, is the most widely used internal control framework in the United States. Numerous other countries and businesses around the world also use this framework. Under the COSO framework, an organization’s internal control should provide reasonable assurance regarding (1) the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (2) the reliability of financial reporting, and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-75">COSO’s<em> Enterprise Risk Management—Integrating with Strategy and Performance</em>, commonly known as the <em>COSO ERM framework</em>, which was updated in 2017. <em>Enterprise risk management (ERM)</em> is a system that identifies and quantifies risks both from potential threats and potential opportunities and manages these risks in a coordinated approach that supports the organization's strategic objectives. The purpose of the updated framework was to integrate ERM into all aspects of an organization’s operations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch16-p-212">Although some overlap exists between the two COSO frameworks, they are designed to complement one another.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch16-p-213">Both frameworks consist of a set of principles organized into five components. For the framework to be effective, a company must adhere to the principles provided under each of the five components. The COSO framework presents 17 principles divided among five interrelated components: the control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch16-h3-9">Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-215">The purpose of the NAIC’s <em>Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation</em> is to improve the ability of state regulators to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies. The Model Regulation, which has been adopted by virtually all the states, has three requirements:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch16-ul-21">
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-76">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-216">An annual audit of an insurer’s financial statements by an independent certified public accountant (CPA), who serves as the external auditor in this situation</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-77">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-217">The filing of a report called <em>Communication of Internal Control Related to Matters Noted in the Audit</em></p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-78">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-218">The filing of a report called <em>Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</em></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-219">The audit and both reports must be filed with the appropriate state insurance commissioner.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch13-div-54k">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch16-h4-6">Annual Audit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-220">The annual audit is due by June 1 following the preceding December 31 year end. For example, the filing of the audit for the year ending December 31, 2018, must be done by June 1, 2019. This audit must be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, or GAAS.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch13-div-54l">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch16-h4-7">Communication of Internal Control Related to Matters Noted in the Audit</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-221">The CPA who conducted the annual audit prepares this report within 60 days after the filing of the audit. In the report, the CPA describes any unremediated—that is, “uncorrected”—material weaknesses noted during the course of the audit. According to GAAS, a <em>material weakness</em> is defined as “a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.”<span class="ens" id="loma361-ch16-span-80"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma361-ch16-en1" epub:type="noteref" id="loma361-ch16-span-81" role="doc-noteref">1</span> </span></p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch16-p-222">If the CPA’s report does not describe the specific actions taken by the insurer to correct an unremediated material weakness, then the insurer is required to provide this description to the state insurance commissioner. If the CPA found no unremediated material weaknesses, she should disclose this fact in her report.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch13-div-54m">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch16-h4-8">Management’s Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch16-p-223">This report describes an insurer’s internal control as of December 31 of the immediately preceding year. Important content in this report includes management’s</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch16-ul-22">
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-79">

	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch16-li-80">
	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-225">Assertion that its internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the company’s financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting principles</p>
	</li>

	<p id="loma361-ch16-p-226">Description of the approach or processes by which it evaluates the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch16-p-227">SOX requires publicly traded insurers to prepare a comparable report. Therefore, stock insurers are permitted to use this report to satisfy this requirement of the Model Regulation.</p>
