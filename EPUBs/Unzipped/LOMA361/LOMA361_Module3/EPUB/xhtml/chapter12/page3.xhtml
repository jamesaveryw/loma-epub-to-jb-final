<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch12-h2-4">Responsibility Accounting</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch12-p-21">One key function of management is assigning to individuals in the company responsibility for specified operations. In the terminology of management, <em>responsibility</em> is an employee’s obligation to perform assigned duties. Employees should clearly understand their areas of responsibility, and a company’s organization should promote this understanding. <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-responsibilityaccounting" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-6" role="doc-glossref">Responsibility accounting</span> is a people-oriented system of policies and procedures that allows for revenues, expenses (also known as <em>costs</em>), and investments to be assigned to the specified employee or organizational level that is accountable for those specific revenues, expenses, and investments. Companies use responsibility accounting to report internally on the status of operations and other specified areas of management responsibility. Responsibility accounting gives a company an effective tool for controlling revenues and expenses and an objective means of evaluating its managers and supervisors.</p>

<div class="clearfix">&#160;</div>
<h3 id="loma361-ch12-h3-1">Responsibility Centers</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch12-p-22">The area, function, or organizational unit that a specified manager controls is called a <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-responsibilitycenter" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-7" role="doc-glossref">responsibility center</span>. A manager of a responsibility center, called a <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-responsibilitymanager" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-8" role="doc-glossref">responsibility manager</span>, is evaluated according to the performance of the responsibility center. A responsibility center defines the sphere of its manager’s responsibility. Note that a responsibility manager is not a position or a formal title in and of itself.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-23">Under responsibility accounting, responsibility managers are held accountable only for the revenues, expenses, and investments over which they have direct control. In other words, only those items that can be directly attributable to a given responsibility center are the responsibility of that center’s manager. For example, an IT manager may be accountable for expenses that arise when she is assigned to purchase new investment management software for the investments department, as the IT manager has direct control over the software purchase. However, the IT manager is not responsible for gains and losses incurred by any investments made with the new software, as the actual investments are not under her control.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-24">A responsibility center can be a department, division, line of business, or product line. In the context of cost accounting, a <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-lineofbusiness" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-9" role="doc-glossref">line of business</span>, sometimes called a <em>product line</em>, is a part of a business that has a cost pattern distinct from that of other lines of business. Examples of an insurer’s lines of business include individual life insurance, annuities, health insurance, and group life insurance.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-25">The exact classification of responsibility centers varies from company to company, but in general, responsibility centers take four specific forms:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch12-ul-5">
	<li id="loma361-ch12-li-17">
	<p id="loma361-ch12-p-26">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-costcenter" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-10" role="doc-glossref">cost center</span> is a department or division to which costs (expenses) can be traced. Though most cost centers are vital to a company’s function, they do not directly generate revenues or control the assets used to earn profits. Thus, a responsibility manager’s main objective in a cost center is to minimize costs while maintaining effective, efficient operations. Examples of insurance company cost centers are the accounting department, the legal department, and the claims department.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch12-li-18">
	<p id="loma361-ch12-p-27">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-revenuecenter" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-11" role="doc-glossref">revenue center</span> is a department or division to which revenues can be traced. A revenue center does not directly control costs. For example, an insurance company may designate a sales branch as a revenue center because revenues can be traced to it, although the branch manager is not directly responsible for cost control.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch12-li-19">
	<p id="loma361-ch12-p-28">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-profitcenter" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-12" role="doc-glossref">profit center</span> is a department or other business segment to which both costs (expenses) and revenues can be traced. Although the responsibility manager of a profit center has direct control over the revenues and expenses associated with the center, the manager does not have direct control over assets that are invested in the center. Examples of insurance company profit centers include the company’s lines of business.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch12-li-20">
	<p id="loma361-ch12-p-29">An <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-investmentcenter" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-13" role="doc-glossref">investment center</span> is a department or division to which costs (expenses), revenues, and capital or investment funds can be traced. The responsibility manager of an investment center has direct control over the revenues, expenses, and investment funds associated with the center. Examples of an insurer’s investment centers are lines of business and company divisions, including the investment division, that invest the company’s assets.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-30">The distinction among cost centers, revenue centers, profit centers, and investment centers differs from company to company. For example, some companies use the term <em>profit center</em> to refer both to profit centers and investment centers. In these companies, a line of business, division, or product line may be either a profit center or an investment center, depending on the amount of direct control the responsibility manager has over costs, revenues, and investment funds. Figure 12.2 shows an example of the organization of responsibility centers in a life insurance company. In this example, we assume that the managers of the individual insurance division have control over capital investment decisions for the division. Note that several responsibility centers that provide shared services—such as IT, legal, accounting, and human resources (HR)—cannot be traced to a specific product line.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch12-h3-2">Responsibility Center Costs</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch12-p-32">To establish and evaluate distinct responsibility centers, a company must be able to separate a center’s expenses into the following categories: (1) controllable and noncontrollable costs, and (2) direct and indirect costs. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-controllablecost" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-16" role="doc-glossref">controllable cost</span> is a cost over which a responsibility manager has decision-making authority. For example, the costs of supplies, travel, and overtime pay are controllable costs within a department because the responsibility manager can decide whether or not these costs should be incurred. On the other hand, a <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-noncontrollablecost" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-17" role="doc-glossref">noncontrollable cost</span> is a cost over which a responsibility manager has no decision-making authority. One example of a noncontrollable cost is office rent: a responsibility manager cannot control the rent paid or the portion of the rent allocated to her department.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-33">Note that controllable and noncontrollable costs are measured from the perspective of a specific responsibility center: a noncontrollable cost from the perspective of one responsibility manager is usually a controllable cost from the perspective of another responsibility manager, or from the perspective of senior management. For example, office rent is a noncontrollable cost from the perspective of most responsibility managers, but it is ultimately a controllable cost from the perspective of senior management, who have the decision-making authority to negotiate rental agreements.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-34">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-directcost" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-18" role="doc-glossref">direct cost</span> is identified specifically with a single cost object. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-costobject" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-19" role="doc-glossref">cost object</span> is any purpose for which a company measures costs. Sample cost objects include product lines, employee salaries, customer service, and so on. A simple way to determine whether a cost is a direct cost of a specified cost object is to ask: Would the cost disappear if the cost object disappeared? If the answer is yes, then the cost is a direct cost. For example, the salary of a responsibility manager is a direct cost of that center. In addition, the salary of the manager of an insurer’s group life insurance line of business is a direct cost to that line of business because the salary cost disappears if the insurer eliminates this line of business. Repair and maintenance costs for equipment that is used exclusively in one responsibility center are also direct costs of that responsibility center because these costs would disappear if the equipment were sold or removed from the responsibility center.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch12-p-35">A cost that cannot be identified specifically with a single cost object is an <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-indirectcost" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch12-span-20" role="doc-glossref">indirect cost</span>, sometimes called a <em>common cost</em> or a <em>shared cost</em>. Again, ask the question: Would the cost disappear if the cost object disappeared? If the answer is no, then the cost is an indirect cost. For example, the salary of an insurer’s vice president in charge of both the individual life insurance and group life insurance lines of business is an indirect cost from the point of view of the individual life insurance line of business. If the insurer eliminated the individual life insurance line of business, the vice president’s salary cost would not disappear. Overhead expenses are another example of indirect costs.</p>
