<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch13-h2-4">Cost Management</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch13-p-21">First, we should note that cost accounting is only one part of cost management. <em>Cost management</em> is the process of estimating, planning, and controlling the costs that a business incurs. Every department of a company has an interest in cost control, and a company generally expects every department to play its part in keeping costs at reasonable levels. Therefore, cost management is typically a holistic practice. The Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), in <em>The Behavioral Aspects of Cost</em> <em>Management</em>, suggests a 5Cs framework for such a holistic approach,<span class="ens" id="loma361-ch13-span-8"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma361-ch13-en1" epub:type="noteref" id="loma361-ch13-span-9" role="doc-noteref">1</span> </span> as illustrated in Figure 13.1 and described below:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch13-ul-5">
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-21">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-23"><em>Culture</em>. The central foundation for the 5Cs approach to cost management is the company’s organizational culture. Because cost control affects decisions throughout the company, the company’s culture should stress the responsibility of cost control. When managers and employees in all departments are mindful of cost control, the measures they take on a regular basis can contribute greatly to the company’s cost management.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-22">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-24"><em>Care</em>. A company must possess the desire to manage costs. It is not enough for senior management to instruct managers to keep costs under control. The company should provide the necessary tools for cost management, as well as recognize and reward employees’ efforts to control costs.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-23">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-25"><em>Communication</em>. A company should make its cost information available and understandable to its employees. These actions promote a company-wide understanding of which costs are each department’s responsibility. In effect, a company’s responsibility accounting should be transparent.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-24">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-26"><em>Collaboration</em>. Cost management is more effective when managers and employees work together on the process. This collaboration should not be restricted to assistance within a department, but should apply across silos within a company. Collaborating on cost management keeps the larger, holistic goal in view.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-25">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-27"><em>Continuation</em>. A company’s cost management techniques should continue to apply over time, even if personnel changes. This approach emphasizes skills to be taught and passed on, not simply initiatives that have a starting point and an ending point.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-28">The categories do not operate independently, but complement one another. For example, a company culture that stresses cost control demonstrates that it cares about cost management; strong communication strengthens collaboration; and so on. This overlap demonstrates that cost management is a holistic discipline. However, a company also requires more specialized tools to inform its specific cost control measures. Cost accounting systems are the most vital of these specialized tools.</p>
