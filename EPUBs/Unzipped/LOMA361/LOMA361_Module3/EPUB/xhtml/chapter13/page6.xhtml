<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch13-h2-7">Allocation Bases</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch13-p-125">To help allocate indirect costs to cost centers equitably, insurers determine an <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-allocationbase" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-47" role="doc-glossref">allocation base</span>, which is a measure of use that exhibits a logical relationship between indirect costs—typically overhead costs—and cost centers. Different allocation methods and allocation bases are typically appropriate for various types of costs. Common allocation bases include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch13-ul-13">
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-64">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-126"><em>Amount of square footage:</em> Under this allocation base, an insurer allocates indirect costs according to the size of a cost center’s workspace. Utility bills are an example of costs that are often allocated to cost centers according to square footage. If a cost center uses 20 percent of an insurer’s office space, the insurer would allocate 20 percent of the total utility bills to that cost center under this allocation base.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-65">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-127"><em>Number of employees:</em> Under this allocation base, an insurer allocates indirect costs according to the relative number of employees in each cost center. For example, if a cost center employs 63 percent of an insurer’s employees, the insurer would allocate 63 percent of the company’s indirect costs to this cost center.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-66">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-128"><em>Percentage of direct costs:</em> Under this allocation base, an insurer allocates indirect costs in proportion to the level of direct costs a cost center generates. Suppose an insurer’s new business department incurs 17 percent of an insurer’s direct costs in a year. In this case, the insurer would allocate 17 percent of all indirect costs to the new business department.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-129">Salaries usually represent the largest percentage of indirect costs in a life insurance company. Most companies allocate indirect salary costs by using time analysis, which is beyond the scope of this textbook. Indirect costs other than salaries include rent, utilities, institutional advertising, association dues, medical fees, and information processing services. A company may or may not decide to distribute these costs among cost centers. Usually the size of the company and the level of financial information needed for decision-making are key factors in determining the allocation of these indirect costs. Similarly, the methods of allocating such indirect costs also vary by company, and even within a company depending on the cost type. Typically, a company allocates indirect costs other than salaries in the same proportion as the direct salary costs for that department or function. Thus, when a number of cost centers are involved in one function, the company allocates indirect costs based on each cost center’s share of the total payroll. Figure 13.6 shows an example of this method of cost allocation.</p>

<p class="fig-text" id="loma361-ch13-p-131">The Hearthfire Life Insurance Company has four cost centers: A, B, C, and D. Each center is responsible for a percentage of Hearthfire’s total employee salaries. Because Hearthfire is unable to track direct usage of office supplies by cost center, Hearthfire allocates office supply expenses in the same proportion as each cost center’s salary expense.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-132">An insurer can divide its departments into operating departments and service departments. A department that engages in an insurance company’s revenue-generating activities is often called an <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-operatingdepartment" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-50" role="doc-glossref">operating department</span> or a <em>production department</em>. An insurer’s operating departments provide products and services directly to and for the insurer’s external customers in order to generate revenue for the insurer. Typical operating departments in an insurance company are</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-139">All costs incurred by an operating department are directly traceable to a specific product.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-140">On the other hand, a <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-servicedepartment" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-51" role="doc-glossref">service department</span> provides support services to operating departments and to other service departments, but it does not generate revenue. An insurer’s service departments provide products and services for the insurer’s internal customers, including its operating departments and other service departments, but not directly to the insurer’s external customers. Examples of service departments include</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-147">Note that a department might have service as its primary function, yet not be a service department. For example, a policyowner service department is defined by—and named for—the services it provides, but because it supports external customers rather than internal customers, it is an operating department.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch13-p-148">A service department’s costs are indirect costs, which a company typically allocates to the centers that use the services. Companies typically use one of several methods of allocating service department costs, as follows:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch13-ul-16">
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-79">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-149">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-directmethod" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-52" role="doc-glossref">direct method</span> of cost allocation assumes that service departments benefit operating departments only. No consideration is given to services provided by one service department to another, such as IT services provided to accounting.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-80">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-150">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-stepmethod" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-53" role="doc-glossref">step method</span> of cost allocation, also called <em>step-down allocation</em>, assumes that service departments perform services for other service departments as well as for operating departments. For example, the human resources department performs personnel functions for other departments, including accounting, underwriting, and premium collection. Under the step method, a service department’s costs are allocated to other benefiting service departments first, and then to benefiting operating departments.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-81">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-151">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-reciprocalmethod" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-54" role="doc-glossref">reciprocal method</span>, also called the <em>simultaneous method</em>, of cost allocation fully recognizes the activities that service departments perform for each other. Unlike the other methods, the reciprocal method requires the allocation of costs back and forth between all service departments using simultaneous equations. The reciprocal method is generally both more complex and more accurate than either the direct method or step method.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch13-li-82">
	<p id="loma361-ch13-p-152">Using the <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-chargebackmethod" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch13-span-55" role="doc-glossref">chargeback method</span>, a department allocates its indirect costs to departments based on usage. You can think of chargebacks as internal billing. When one department performs work for another department, the first department records the costs of the service, effectively billing the second department for its services. Chargebacks are most common for corporate service functions such as building services, accounting, IT services, human resources, and office services.</p>
