Horizontal analysis uses comparative financial statements, which present data for two or more accounting periods side by side. Horizontal analysis can be applied to any financial statement.</p><p class=\"explanations\">Vertical analysis provides additional context for the figures on a financial statement, making it easier for managers to determine if an amount represents a particular strength of the company or if it indicates a potential cause for concern.

arrAnswerFeedback[1] = "<p class=\"explanations\">The financial reporting period chosen as the reference point for horizontal analysis is known as the base period, which could be a specific month, quarter, year, or other appropriate period. In most cases, the base period is the earliest period. For truly accurate analysis, a company must be sure it is including identical categories for analysis in each period. A category that is present in one period and absent in another can weight the findings, which makes the analysis less accurate and useful.</p><p class=\"explanations\">To calculate the absolute monetary amount of the change being analyzed, subtract the base period amount from the amount of the period under study.

arrAnswerFeedback[2] = "<p class=\"explanations\">A trend is a consistent pattern of change displayed over time. Trend analysis, also called trend percentages or index-number trend analysis, is a specific type of horizontal analysis that involves calculating percentage changes in financial statement items over several successive accounting periods, rather than over just two periods. Comparative financial statements indicate the direction and velocity of trends. Direction refers to whether a trend displays an increase or decrease in an account. Velocity refers to whether the increase or decrease in an account is gradual or rapid.</p><p class=\"explanations\">To conduct trend analysis, use the following procedure. (1) Select a base period. In this situation, Year 1 would be the base period—that is, the year to which you would compare all other years. (2) List all the amounts in the base period as 100. Each 100 represents 100 percent and is an index number. An index number is a statistical method for measuring the change in a variable. (3) Express each corresponding amount from nonbase years as a percentage of the applicable base year amount. Note that index numbers can be calculated only when the amounts are positive.</p><p class=\"explanations\">In this situation, Valiant’s premium income index numbers are 100, 125, 160, and 180 and its benefits paid index numbers are 100, 110, 120, and 130. For example, to calculate the benefits paid index number in Year&nbsp;2, divide the difference between benefits paid in Year&nbsp;1 and Year&nbsp;2 by the benefits paid in Year&nbsp;1 (the base year), then multiply the result by 100: ($825 – $750) ÷ $750 × 100 = 110.

arrAnswerFeedback[2] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Fundamental to cost-volume-profit (CVP) analysis is the concept of contribution margin, which is the difference between a product’s total revenues and its total variable costs. To calculate a product’s contribution margin, an insurer must separate the product’s fixed costs—such as rent, utilities, and some employee salaries—from its variable costs, such as agent commissions and operating expenses. In this situation, the contribution margin on Encore’s new term life insurance product is equal to $3,000,000, calculated as $8,000,000 total product sales revenues – $5,000,000 total product variable costs.</p><p class=\"explanations\">The point at which a product’s revenues are equal to its costs (expenses) is the breakeven point—the product generates no profit and no loss at this point. By calculating the breakeven point, a manager can determine the level of sales at which the product will produce a net gain. One way to calculate the breakeven point is Fixed Costs ÷ (Unit Selling Price – Unit Variable Cost). In this situation, the breakeven point on Encore’s new term life insurance product is equal to 1,000,000 units, calculated as ($8,000,000&nbsp;– $5,000,000 ÷ [($8,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000) – ($5,000,000 ÷ 1,000,000)].</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 14D.
