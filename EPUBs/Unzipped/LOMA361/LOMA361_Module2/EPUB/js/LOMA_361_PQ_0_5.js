Examples of admitted assets are cash, cash equivalents, and most invested assets. Nonadmitted assets are reported on the <i>Assets</i> page of the Annual Statement but are accorded no value. Most nonadmitted assets are used in the normal process of doing business, such as office furniture and equipment. Some assets are partially nonadmitted, which means that only a portion of their value is reported on the <i>Assets</i> page of the Annual Statement. One example of a partially nonadmitted asset is deferred tax assets.</p><p class=\"explanations\">Admitted assets can easily be converted to cash—without a loss in value—to pay for an insurer’s obligations, whereas nonadmitted assets do not possess this quality. By not allowing an insurer to report a value (or a full value) for a nonliquid asset, statutory regulators enforce the concept of conservatism.</p><p class=\"explanations\">Admitted assets and nonadmitted assets are only relevant for statutory reporting purposes.

In this situation, the Trope bond is an example of a debt security, <b>not </b>an equity security.</p>";
arrAnswerFeedback[1] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Because the Trope bond’s $1,300 fair value is higher than its $1,000 par value, the Trope bond most likely would sell at a premium.

An escrow account is a trust account used by a mortgage lender to pay property maintenance expenses, property taxes, and other expenses related to a mortgaged property.

arrAnswerFeedback[1] = "<p class=\"explanations\">Insurers generally use derivatives to mitigate their exposure to various risks. To protect itself from a given risk, an insurer takes an action—such as entering into a derivatives contract—that “hedges” or minimizes that risk. Under both U.S. GAAP and SAP, insurers typically include derivatives on the balance sheet or disclose them in notes that accompany their financial statements. Under SAP, insurers must also report their derivatives in Schedule DB of their Quarterly and Annual Statements. U.S. GAAP requires insurers to recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value, regardless of the purpose for holding the derivative.</p><p class=\"explanations\">Under SAP, the purpose for holding a derivative dictates the manner in which it is reported. Derivatives used for hedging generally should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the item being hedged. If the item being hedged is reported at amortized cost, then the derivative should be reported at amortized cost. Derivatives held for other purposes—for example, to generate income—typically are reported at fair value, and any changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized in current operations.</p><p class=\"explanations\"><b>Learning Objective: 5G.
