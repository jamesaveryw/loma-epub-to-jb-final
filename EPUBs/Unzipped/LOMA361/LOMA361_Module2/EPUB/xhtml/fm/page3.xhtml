            <p id="loma361-fm-p-25">On behalf of LOMA and its membership, we would like to thank all of the
                LOMA 361 text reviewers and the companies that supported their efforts.
                Text reviewers are busy industry professionals who actively support the
                educational needs of current and future industry employees and generously
                volunteer their time and expertise to review a text’s content. The LOMA
                361 text development panel made many substantive contributions, commented
                on the developing chapters, provided suggestions for additional content,
                submitted relevant research materials, and answered numerous questions
                posed by LOMA staff. LOMA is responsible for the accuracy and clarity of
                the text, and takes responsibility for any errors.</p>
