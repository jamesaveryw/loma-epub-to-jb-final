                    into convenient modules—chapter clusters that help to focus the learning
                    process by breaking up the course content into meaningful sections. In
                    addition to the assigned study materials, the Course Portal provides access
                    to an array of blended learning resources, including multimedia features
                    designed to enhance the learning experience. The Course Portal provides
