            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch8-p-143">In certain situations, an insurer may need to record specified premium
                payments as liabilities. Some of these situations depend on the timing
                of the premium payments, whereas others depend on the type of product or
                contract to which the premiums apply.</p>

            <h3 id="loma361-ch8-h3-8">Premium Suspense Accounts</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch8-p-144">The accounting entry to record an insurer’s receipt of a premium typically
                includes a debit to <em>Cash</em>. However, the insurer may not be able
                to determine immediately the credit entry to offset the debit to <em>Cash</em>.
                In such situations, many insurers use premium suspense accounts. In accounting
                terminology, a <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-suspenseaccount" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma361-ch8-span-55" role="doc-glossref">suspense account</span> is
                an account that is used to record transactions that cannot be posted immediately
                to a specified account. Specifically, <em>Premium Suspense</em> is the liability
                account used to record transactions that are intended as premiums, but
                that the insurer cannot accept as income until a particular event occurs.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma361-ch8-p-145">Theoretically, upon policy issue, there is little need for a premium suspense
                account. However, in practice, many insurers initially suspense all insurance
                premiums. Insurers typically use premium suspense accounts for premium
                payment amounts that are (1) renewal premiums, (2) different from the amounts
                in the insurer’s records, or (3) lacking critical information, such as
                a policy number. Another typical use of premium suspense accounts is in
                situations in which an insurer has received the initial premium for a policy
                but is still waiting for an underwriting decision on the policy.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma361-ch8-p-146">A typical accounting entry to record such transactions is as follows:</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch8-p-155">When an insurer receives premiums before they are due, it reports a liability
                                for <em>premiums paid in advance</em> on its U.S. GAAP and statutory financial
                                statements. For life insurance contracts, <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-premiumspaidinadvance"

                                also called <em>advance premiums</em>, are premiums that an insurer has
                                received but that are due on or after the next policy anniversary date.</p>
                            <p
                            class="txt" id="loma361-ch8-p-156">Sometimes included in the category of premiums paid in advance are

                                role="doc-glossref">premium deposits</span>, which, in this context, are amounts that an insurer’s
                                    policyowners leave on deposit with the insurer to pay for several years
                                    of premiums at one time. Because the insurer has the use of these policyowner
                                    funds before they are due, it typically discounts the premiums—in effect,
                                    receiving a smaller amount in cash. However, a more common approach with
                                    these premium deposits is to place them in a liability account known as
                                    a <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-premiumdepositfund" epub:type="glossref"

                                    Under this approach, when an individual premium becomes due, the insurer
                                    pays it from the premium deposit fund and credits <em>Premium Income</em>.</p>

                                            as a deposit liability rather than as revenue. A typical GAAP account title
                                            for this liability is <em>Funds held under deposit contracts</em>.</p>

                                                have premiums, expenses, and interest credits that may not be fixed or
                                                guaranteed. While a UL policy is in force, the insurer credits premiums
                                                and interest to the policy’s account balance and subtracts various expenses
                                                from it. Technically, the policyowner owns this account balance. Therefore,
                                                according to the FASB, under GAAP, an insurer must treat premium payments
                                                for a UL policy as a liability, usually referred to as <em>contract holder liabilities</em>.</p>
