<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch7-h2-4">The Concept of Reserves</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-27">Although establishing adequate reserves is crucial for insurance companies, the process is not always simple. For some insurance products, determining the amount of a reserve is a relatively straightforward process. However, for most insurance products, the amount of an insurer’s future contractual obligations is not known precisely in advance. Because of this uncertainty, the process of setting adequate reserve amounts starts with actuarial assumptions.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch7-div-20">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma361-ch7-h3-1">Actuarial Assumptions</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-28">The amounts that insurers record in their reserve accounts are, of necessity, estimates. When an insurer establishes reserves for a block of guaranteed insurance policies, it knows the total face value of the block of policies and, thus, its future obligation to its customers. However, the insurer can only estimate the amount of investment earnings on the portion of policy premiums it actually invests. In addition, the insurer does not know precisely when a customer or beneficiary will submit a claim on the policy or if a policy will lapse before benefit payments become due. Because of such uncertainties, insurers must estimate the amounts to report in their reserve accounts. These assumed values used in a life insurance or an annuity product design are called <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-actuarialassumptions" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-15" role="doc-glossref">actuarial assumptions</span>. In product design, insurers make assumptions with respect to many factors, such as future mortality rates, investment earnings, expenses, surrenders, and lapses.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-29">To determine the amount of reserves to record in its accounting records, insurers rely on actuaries. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-actuary" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-16" role="doc-glossref">actuary</span> is an expert in financial risk management and the mathematics and modeling of insurance, annuities, and financial instruments. In insurance companies, actuaries are responsible for ensuring that the company’s products are financially sound. Using mathematical probabilities, actuaries estimate the amounts needed to pay future benefits to the insurer’s customers. The insurer then records and reports these amounts as liabilities in its accounting records. Reserves for a block of insurance policies or contracts, a line of business, or an entire company are called <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-aggregatereserves" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-17" role="doc-glossref">aggregate reserves</span>. When you see reserves on an insurer’s balance sheet, you are looking at aggregated reserves for each line of business.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch7-h3-2">Accounting Records and Reserves</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-30">Reserves can vary depending on the type of accounting records the insurer is using. We describe four important types of accounting records for life insurance companies below:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch7-ul-5">
	<li id="loma361-ch7-li-28">
	<p id="loma361-ch7-p-31">As you can guess from your knowledge of GAAP accounting, <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-gaapaccountingrecords" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-18" role="doc-glossref">GAAP accounting records</span> are designed for financial reporting to investors, noninsurance regulators (such as the SEC in the United States), and the general public. In the United States, all stock insurance companies and many mutual insurance companies maintain accounting records and prepare financial statements according to GAAP. Because GAAP accounting records focus on showing a company’s financial stability and its profitability, GAAP is a type of profitability-basis accounting. The reserves calculated for GAAP-based financial statements are called <em>GAAP reserves</em> or <em>profitability-basis reserves</em>.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch7-li-29">
	<p id="loma361-ch7-p-32"><span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-internalaccountingrecords" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-19" role="doc-glossref">Internal accounting records</span>, also known as <em>modified GAAP accounting records</em>, are designed for financial reporting to a company’s management team, whose primary interest is in having appropriate data for making decisions. Internal accounting records are used in management accounting because they are designed to produce results that managers believe present a realistic picture of a company’s financial situation. Each insurer freely sets its own desired accounting standards, although most companies base their internal accounting records and reports on their own modified version of GAAP. Reserves calculated under modified GAAP are called <em>internal reserves</em>. Because internal accounting records contain proprietary information, such as a company’s product sales, investment returns, and profits, these records generally are not released to external parties.</p>

	<li id="loma361-ch7-li-30">
	<p id="loma361-ch7-p-33">As you can surmise from your knowledge of SAP, <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-statutoryaccountingrecords" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-20" role="doc-glossref">statutory accounting records</span>, also called <em>solvency-basis accounting records</em>, are designed to comply with the financial reporting requirements established by state insurance regulators. Statutory accounting records are a type of solvency-basis accounting. Reserves calculated under statutory accounting are called <em>statutory reserves</em>, <em>required reserves</em>, and <em>solvency-basis reserves</em>.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch7-li-31">
	<p id="loma361-ch7-p-34"><span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-taxaccountingrecords" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-21" role="doc-glossref">Tax accounting records</span> are designed for financial reporting to taxing authorities. Typically, the taxing authorities—for example, the IRS and the state revenue departments in the United States—develop the procedures for companies to comply with tax reporting requirements. Reserves calculated for tax accounting purposes are called <em>tax reserves</em>. Most tax accounting topics are outside the scope of this textbook.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch7-h3-3">Reserves for Products</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-35">Life insurance companies establish and monitor several types of reserves that are used in accounting for blocks of life insurance policies or annuity contracts. The various types of reserves enable an insurer to illustrate clearly in its financial statements the nature and extent of its liabilities for policy benefits.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch7-div-23">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch7-h4-1">Contractual Reserves and Noncontractual Reserves</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-36">Insurers have several types of contractual reserves and noncontractual reserves. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-contractualreserve" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-22" role="doc-glossref">contractual reserve</span> is a liability that identifies the amount that, together with future premiums and investment earnings, represents the expected amount of future benefits payable on an insurer’s in-force business. In other words, contractual reserves are the insurer’s estimates for the amounts it needs on hand today to pay contractual benefits on a product as they come due.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma361-ch7-div-24">
<div class="inner" id="loma361-ch7-div-25">
<p class="equation" id="loma361-ch7-p-37"><u><strong>Contractual reserves</strong></u></p>

<p class="equation" id="loma361-ch7-p-38"><strong>Reserves + Future premiums + Investment earnings =</strong></p>

<p class="equation" id="loma361-ch7-p-39"><strong>Expected future benefits payable on in-force business</strong></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-40">Other terms sometimes used for contractual reserves include <em>policy reserves</em>, <em>legal reserves</em>, and <em>tabular reserves </em>in the United States and similar terms in other countries.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-41">In contrast to contractual reserves, a <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-noncontractualreserve" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch7-span-23" role="doc-glossref">noncontractual reserve</span> is a liability amount that an insurer estimates it will need to pay the insurer’s business obligations that are not directly attributable to benefits payable for a specified product. In other words, all reserves that are not contractual reserves are classified as noncontractual reserves. Two examples of noncontractual reserves for life insurers are the asset valuation reserve (AVR) and the interest maintenance reserve (IMR), which we discuss in the next chapter.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch7-div-26">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch7-h4-2">GAAP Reserves and Statutory Reserves</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-42">In recent years, regulatory authorities in the United States have implemented changes that affect how insurers estimate their GAAP reserves and statutory reserves.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-43"><strong>GAAP Reserves</strong></p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-44">For many years, U.S. GAAP generally did not allow an insurer to modify the actuarial assumptions on which it calculated its GAAP reserves—even if the insurer’s assumptions at policy issue turned out to be wrong. Insurers referred to these assumptions as being “locked in” at issue. Estimates of future policy benefits, however, were allowed to include a <em>provision for adverse deviation (PAD)</em>, a safety margin that allowed for unfavorable variations from actuarial assumptions.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-45">In 2018, the FASB issued its ASU titled <em>Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts</em>. According to this ASU, the assumptions that an insurer uses to estimate its future policy benefits are no longer “locked in” at issue. Instead, insurers are allowed to update these assumptions—at least on an annual basis and more frequently if necessary. Because insurers can now update these assumptions, estimates of future policy benefits under GAAP will no longer need to include a PAD.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-46">According&#160;to&#160;the&#160;FASB,&#160;large&#160;publicly&#160;traded&#160;life&#160;insurers&#160;must&#160;start&#160;following&#160;the&#160;rules&#160;in&#160;this&#160;ASU&#160;for&#160;fiscal&#160;years&#160;beginning&#160;after&#160;December&#160;31,&#160;2022.&#160;Smaller&#160;public&#160;insurers&#160;must&#160;start&#160;following&#160;these&#160;rules&#160;for&#160;fiscal&#160;years&#160;beginning&#160;after&#160;December&#160;2024</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-47"><strong>Statutory Reserves</strong></p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch7-p-48">Traditionally, state regulations have mandated that life insurers establish statutory reserves for their products based on prescribed formulas and assumptions. Under this approach, typically known as <em>rules-based reserving</em>, all life insurance companies that sold a specific product were required to use the same formula for reserve valuation and the same estimates of future mortality and investment experience. This one-size-fits-all approach created situations in which some insurers were holding either too little or too much in statutory reserves for a given product.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-49">To address this imbalance, state regulators have endorsed a new approach in recent years: <em>principles-based reserving</em> <em>(PBR)</em>. PBR attempts to “right-size” an insurer’s reserves, so that the reserves an insurer holds for a specific product are based on the insurer’s own experience and risks.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-50">As of the publication date of this text, life insurers are permitted to use PBR for most individual life insurance products. (The new approach applies to products issued on or after January 1, 2017.) Over time, PBR is expected to be developed for additional product lines. By enabling insurers to calculate and report more accurate estimates for their statutory reserves, PBR promises to enhance the reporting function and strengthen the financial position of the insurers that use it.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch7-p-51">Additional detail on PBR and reserve calculation requirements can be found in the <em>Valuation Manual</em> established in the <em>Standard Valuation Law</em> for each state.</p>
