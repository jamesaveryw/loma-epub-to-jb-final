		<li>Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the valuation date.</li>
		<li>Amortized cost typically applies to long-term assets such as bonds and mortgages.</li>

	<p class="explanations">This statement is false; therefore, it is the correct response. Insurers use several methods of valuing assets.

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, for debt securities in general, the sale of a debt security is a Realized Capital Gain if NSP &gt; Book Value, and a Realized Capital Loss if NSP &lt; Book Value. In this situation, the amount of the gain on Crane’s bond sale is equal to $1,350 NSP&#160;–&#160;$1,100 Book Value = $250. An unrealized capital gain or loss does not result from the actual sale of an asset. Under SAP, an Unrealized Capital Gain results if a debt security’s Fair Value &gt; Book Value; an Unrealized Capital Loss results if its Fair Value &lt; Book Value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under GAAP, for debt securities in general, the sale of a debt security is a Realized Capital Gain if NSP &gt; Amortized Cost, and a Realized Capital Loss if NSP &lt; Amortized Cost. Under GAAP, an Unrealized Capital Gain results if a debt security’s Fair Value &gt; the Amortized Cost; an Unrealized Capital Loss results if its Fair Value &lt; the Amortized Cost.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">To comply with statutory reporting requirements, U.S. life insurers must classify their assets as either admitted assets or nonadmitted assets—usually based on their liquidity—on the Annual Statement. Of the following assets, the only one that typically represents a <em>nonadmitted</em> asset for statutory accounting purposes is</p>

		<li>most invested assets</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Admitted assets are assets whose full value is reported on the<em> Assets </em>page of the Annual Statement. Examples of admitted assets are cash, cash equivalents, and most invested assets. Nonadmitted assets are reported on the <em>Assets</em> page of the Annual Statement but are accorded no value. Most nonadmitted assets are used in the normal process of doing business, such as office furniture and equipment. Some assets are partially nonadmitted, which means that only a portion of their value is reported on the <em>Assets</em> page of the Annual Statement. One example of a partially nonadmitted asset is deferred tax assets.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Admitted assets can easily be converted to cash—without a loss in value—to pay for an insurer’s obligations, whereas nonadmitted assets do not possess this quality. By not allowing an insurer to report a value (or a full value) for a nonliquid asset, statutory regulators enforce the concept of conservatism.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Admitted assets and nonadmitted assets are only relevant for statutory reporting purposes. Under GAAP, an insurer includes values for all of its assets in its financial statements. Therefore, the asset amounts in an insurer’s Annual Report rarely equal those shown on the <em>Assets</em> page of the insurer’s Annual Statement.</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>The purchase price paid for a bond is the price used to calculate the annual amount of interest paid on a bond.</li>
		<li>If market interest rates increase, then the prices of existing bonds decrease.</li>
		<li>A bond’s fair value, generally its current market value, does not necessarily equal the bond’s par value.</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. A bond’s coupon rate is a percentage of its par value. The annual amount of interest paid on a bond is based on the bond’s coupon rate and the par value of the bond, regardless of the actual price paid for the bond.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Changes in an existing bond’s price generally are inversely related to changes in market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, then the prices of existing bonds decrease. If market interest rates decrease, then the prices of existing bonds increase.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is correct. Because of the inverse relationship between market interest rates and bond prices, a bond’s purchase price and its par value often differ. Generally, a bond will sell at a discount—less than its par value—if market interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate and will sell at a premium—greater than its par value—if market interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Five years ago, the Restful Life Insurance Company purchased a $1,000 par value secured bond for $900 from the Trope Corporation, the bond issuer. The bond pays an annual coupon rate of interest of 4%, payable semiannually. The fair value of the Trope bond is $1,300. One correct statement about this situation is that</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>the Trope bond is an example of an equity security</li>
		<li>current market interest rates most likely are higher than 4%</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">If the purchase price differs from the bond’s par value, then the actual rate of return—known as the effective rate of return or effective yield—on the amount paid for the bond will differ from the coupon rate. A bond purchased at par value will have an effective rate of return equal to the bond’s coupon rate.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The effective rate of return on a bond typically is higher than the coupon rate for a bond purchased at a discount and lower than the coupon rate for a bond purchased at a premium. To obtain the effective rate of return, divide the annual bond interest ($1,000 par value ÷ 4% coupon rate = $40) by the purchase price paid for the bond. In this situation, $40 annual bond interest ÷ $900 bond purchase price = 4.44% effective rate of return.</p>

		<li>Escrow account transactions directly affect the outstanding principal and interest payments on a mortgage.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Mortgages and mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) are debt securities, which appeal to insurers because they generally return a predictable stream of cash flows by providing (1) monthly debt repayment schedules and (2) a minimum, often fixed, rate of return. MBSs are secured by a pool of residential mortgages (RMBs) or commercial mortgages (CMBSs); shares in the pool are sold to investors.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under both GAAP and SAP, mortgages generally are reported at their outstanding principal balance or amortized cost (if acquired at a discount or a premium). For U.S. statutory accounting purposes, MBSs are classified as bonds.</p>

Under statutory accounting, most common stock is reported at fair value as of the financial reporting date.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Preferred stock is considered a hybrid security: it resembles a debt security with its stated dividend rate, which functions like an interest payment; and it resembles an equity security with its potential for price appreciation.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, most preferred stock is reported in a manner similar to bonds. Preferred stock that has an NAIC designation of 1-3 is reported at its amortized cost. However, for preferred stock with an NAIC designation of 4-6, insurers use the lower-of-cost-or-market (LCM) rule to report the stock’s value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">If an insurer buys a bond between coupon payment dates, accrued interest income for this bond was actually earned by the bond seller prior to the date of purchase. In the context of bond interest income, accrued income is the amount of interest that has been earned on a bond, but is not yet payable to the bondholder as of the financial reporting date. Typical financial reporting dates are month-end, quarter-end, and year-end. To compensate the seller for this lost interest, the bond’s purchase price must include an amount equal to the accrued interest income as of the date of purchase.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, Genial’s income statement would include only $20 of bond interest income because the bond seller earned the remaining $10 in bond interest income. Note that <em>Investment Income Due and Accrued</em> is an asset account, and <em>Bond Interest Income</em> is a revenue account.</p>

This approach to managing risk is known as <strong>(hedging / the&#160;notional&#160;amount)</strong>. Insurers can also use derivatives to generate income.

	<p class="explanations">Insurers generally use derivatives to mitigate their exposure to various risks. To protect itself from a given risk, an insurer takes an action—such as entering into a derivatives contract—that “hedges” or minimizes that risk. Under both U.S. GAAP and SAP, insurers typically include derivatives on the balance sheet or disclose them in notes that accompany their financial statements. Under SAP, insurers must also report their derivatives in Schedule DB of their Quarterly and Annual Statements. U.S. GAAP requires insurers to recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value, regardless of the purpose for holding the derivative.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, the purpose for holding a derivative dictates the manner in which it is reported. Derivatives used for hedging generally should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the item being hedged. If the item being hedged is reported at amortized cost, then the derivative should be reported at amortized cost. Derivatives held for other purposes—for example, to generate income—typically are reported at fair value, and any changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized in current operations.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Cash equivalents are short-term assets that will mature in 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Examples of cash equivalents include Treasury bills, or T-bills, that will mature within 90 days or less of the date of purchase. T-bills are short-term assets issued and guaranteed by the U.S. government.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In accounting, prepaid expenses are those expenditures, paid in advance, that the insurer expects will provide a future value or benefit. Examples include rent, subscriptions, and service contracts. Under SAP, prepaid expenses are considered nonadmitted assets, because they are not readily available to satisfy policyowner obligations. Under GAAP, prepaid expenses are classified as short-term assets, and are charged to the accounting period in which the benefits are received or used.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, for policy premiums that are paid more frequently than annually, life insurers use short-term asset accounts—such as <em>Deferred Premiums</em> or&#160;<em>Uncollected Premiums</em>—to record and report policy premiums that were due, but that have not been received by the insurer. Deferred premiums are life insurance premiums due after the statutory reporting date but before the next policy anniversary date. Uncollected premiums are individual life insurance policy premiums that are due before the statutory reporting date but have not been received as of that date.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A contra account—usually an asset account—has a normal balance that is the opposite of its companion account. The amounts in a contra account usually decrease the balance in the companion account. The monetary amount in a contra account should not be larger than the amount in its companion account.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Because asset accounts and expense accounts have a normal debit balance, contra asset accounts and contra expense accounts have a normal credit balance. Similarly, liability accounts, equity accounts, and revenue accounts have a normal credit balance, so their contra accounts have a normal debit balance.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Life insurance companies in the United States depreciate the cost of real estate—except for land—over the useful economic life of the property. Contra accounts are generally used to amortize real estate depreciation. By using contra accounts for real estate, an insurer records <em>Accumulated Depreciation</em>—a contra account—separately from <em>Real Estate</em> (the named property account), the companion asset account.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Land is not depreciated under U.S. accounting standards. Instead, the insurer values land at its historical cost until the property is sold. Over time, however, depreciation will allocate the cost of the asset over the asset’s estimated useful life.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Mica’s sale of the Gamut Building resulted in a $520,000 realized capital gain: $1,400,000 Sale Price – ($1,000,000 Cost – $120,000 Accumulated Depreciation), also known as Book Value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">When an insurer obtains reinsurance on a policy, the insurer is usually responsible for paying benefits to any and all policy beneficiaries. However, because the reinsurer has assumed a portion or all of the risk associated with the policy, the reinsurer is typically obligated to pay its contracted share of the benefits to the direct writer—in this case, the insurer—to comply with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. The money that the reinsurer is obligated to pay the insurer is an asset to the insurer. <em>Amount Recoverable from Reinsurer</em> is a statutory account.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A policy loan, called a certificate loan in fraternal benefit societies, is a loan made to a policyowner and secured by a policy’s cash surrender value as collateral. Interest is charged on policy loans, which are unique to life insurers. Policyowners usually pay the accrued policy loan interest when repaying the principal on a policy loan. The typical accounting entry to record the insurer’s receipt of principal and interest on a policy loan consists of a debit to <em>Cash</em>, a credit to <em>Policy Loans </em>or <em>Contract Loans</em>, and a credit to <em>Investment Income</em> for the interest portion.</p>

	<p class="explanations">For statutory reporting purposes, policy loans typically are considered admitted assets. They are reported at book value, which means the original loan amount, plus accrued interest, minus principal repayments. <em>Contract Loans</em>, an asset account, is reported separately from <em>Investment Income</em>, a revenue account. However, for financial reporting purposes, policy loan interest that is due and accrued is reported as part of <em>Investment Income Due and Accrued</em>, an asset account.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The Separate Accounts Annual Statement, which has only an annual version, also reports on the net flow of funds between the general account and the separate accounts. In addition, the investment activities of an insurer’s separate accounts—investment purchases and sales, capital gains and losses, and investment income—are reported only in the Separate Accounts Annual Statement.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The Separate Accounts Annual Statement also includes a unique exhibit called “Guaranteed insurance and annuity products”—or “Exhibit 6”—that separates the liabilities for guaranteed products from those for nonguaranteed products.

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Aggregate reserves are reserves for a block of insurance policies or contracts, a line of business, or an entire company.</li>
		<li>Because the amount of an insurer’s future contractual obligations is known precisely in advance, determining the amount of a reserve is a relatively straightforward process.</li>

		<li>B only</li>
		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. To determine the amount of reserves to record in its accounting records, insurers rely on actuaries, who are experts in financial risk management and who are responsible for ensuring that an insurer’s products are financially sound. Using mathematical probabilities, actuaries estimate the amounts needed to pay future benefits to the insurer’s customers. The insurer then records and reports these amounts as liabilities in its accounting records and on the insurer’s balance sheet.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is incorrect. For most insurance products, the amount of an insurer’s future contractual obligations is not known precisely in advance. Therefore, insurers must set adequate reserve amounts by identifying and consistently applying a reasonable set of actuarial assumptions and reserve valuation methods. In product design, insurers make actuarial assumptions with regard to many factors, such as future mortality rates, investment earnings, expenses, surrenders, and lapses.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Reserves can vary depending on the type of accounting records an insurer uses. Common types of accounting records used by U.S. insurers include statutory accounting records, GAAP accounting records, internal accounting records, and tax accounting records. <strong>(Statutory / GAAP)</strong> accounting records are designed to comply with the financial reporting requirements established by state insurance regulators. <strong>(Statutory / GAAP)</strong> accounting records are a type of profitability-basis accounting.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statutory accounting records, also called solvency-basis accounting records, are designed to comply with the financial reporting requirements established by state insurance regulators. Statutory accounting records are a type of solvency-basis accounting. Reserves calculated under statutory accounting are called statutory reserves, required reserves, and solvency-basis reserves.</p>

	<p class="explanations">GAAP accounting records are designed for financial reporting to investors, noninsurance regulators (such as the SEC in the United States), and the general public. In the United States, all stock insurance companies and many mutual insurance companies maintain accounting records and prepare financial statements according to GAAP. Because GAAP accounting records focus on showing a company’s financial stability and its profitability, GAAP is a type of profitability-basis accounting. The reserves calculated for GAAP-based financial statements are called GAAP reserves or profitability-basis reserves.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A contractual reserve is a liability that identifies the amount that, together with future premiums and investment earnings, represents the expected amount of future benefits payable on an insurer’s in-force business.

Other terms sometimes used for contractual reserves include policy reserves, legal reserves, and tabular reserves in the United States and similar terms in other countries.</p>

	<p class="explanations">All reserves that are not contractual reserves are classified as noncontractual reserves. Two examples of noncontractual reserves for life insurers are the asset valuation reserve (AVR) and the interest maintenance reserve (IMR), which are statutory accounts designed to absorb gains and losses on the insurer’s invested assets.</p>

		<li>A recent Accounting Standard Update (ASU) from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires U.S. GAAP reserves to be based on principles-based reserving.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Historically, U.S. GAAP did not allow an insurer to modify the actuarial assumptions on which it calculated its GAAP reserves, even if the assumptions at policy issue turned out to be wrong.</li>
		<li>Statutory reserves permit insurers to include a provision for adverse deviation (PAD) in estimates of future policy benefits to allow for unfavorable variations from actuarial assumptions.</li>
		<li>State regulators recently have endorsed rules-based reserving so that the reserves an insurer holds for a specific product are based on the insurer’s own experience and risks.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under U.S. GAAP, although insurers had not been allowed to modify the actuarial assumptions on which GAAP reserves were calculated, they were allowed to include a provision for adverse deviation (PAD), a safety margin that allowed for unfavorable variations from actuarial assumptions. Recently, the FASB issued ASU <em>Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts</em> ASU, which allows insurers to update actuarial assumptions. As a result of this ASU, estimates of future policy benefits under GAAP will no longer need to include a PAD.</p>

	<p class="explanations">State regulators had mandated that life insurers establish statutory reserves based on prescribed formulas and assumptions. Under this approach, typically known as rules-based reserving, all life insurers that sold a specific product were required to use the same formula for reserve valuation and the same estimates of future mortality and investment experience. Rules-based reserving created situations in which some insurers were holding either too little or too much in statutory reserves for a given product. To address this imbalance, state regulators have endorsed principles-based<strong> </strong>reserving (PBR) for most individual life insurance products. PBR attempts to “right-size” an insurer’s reserves; an insurer holds reserves for a product based on the insurer’s experience and risks. PBR is expected to be developed for additional product lines.</p>

At the time when $700,000 in policy benefits was paid, the balance in the reserve account for this block of policies was $300,000. Maze paid no policy dividends or cash dividends on this block of policies. Upon payment of the $700,000 policy benefits, Maze would release the $300,000 reserve amount.

	<p class="explanations">Upon the payment of the $700,000 in policy benefits, Maze would release $300,000 of reserves.

When it closes out the accounting period, Maze adds net income to surplus.

	<p class="explanations">An insurer’s liabilities consist primarily of its reserves for contractual benefits. If a reserve is too low, an insurer may consider strengthening it. Typically, this situation occurs if the insurer’s experience with a product reveals that the assumptions used to calculate contractual reserves were too optimistic. Insurers strengthen reserves by using actuarial assumptions that are less favorable to the company than those used in the original reserve valuation.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Conversely, an insurer may decide, based on its experience with a product, that the product’s reserves are too high, calling for reserve destrengthening. Insurers destrengthen reserves by using actuarial assumptions that are more favorable to the company than those used in the original reserve valuation. For insurers that operate in the United States, reserve destrengthening requires regulatory permission from the insurance commissioner in the insurer’s state of domicile. In practice, insurers rarely destrengthen their contractual reserves.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Think of the effects of reserve strengthening and reserve destrengthening in terms of the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital and Surplus. Strengthening reserves increases Reserves (Liabilities) on the right side of the basic accounting equation, but results in no change in Assets on the left side of the equation. Because the basic accounting equation must balance, Capital and Surplus must decrease. In contrast, reserve destrengthening means a decrease in Reserves (Liabilities), and an increase in Capital and Surplus, all other factors remaining equal.</p>

		<li>The reduction in surplus strain that is achieved by using reinsurance is a type of surplus relief.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">This statement is false; therefore, it is the correct response. For a new product, first-year costs of contract issue, sales commissions, and the creation of new reserves typically combine to produce a negative first-year surplus, which is an aspect of surplus strain. Surplus strain, also known as issue strain or new business strain, is the <strong>decrease</strong> in an insurer’s surplus caused by the high first-year costs and the reserve requirements associated with new products. Surplus relief is a decrease in potential surplus strain that strengthens an insurer’s financial position.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In addition to establishing contractual reserves, each life insurer in the United States also must establish two statutory reserves—the asset valuation reserve (AVR) and the interest maintenance reserve (IMR)—designed to absorb capital gains and losses on the insurer’s invested assets in the general account. Each reserve has several distinct characteristics. However, one characteristic of <em>both</em> the AVR and the IMR is that they minimize the effects of</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>fluctuations in value on an insurer’s invested assets in equity securities and debt securities</li>
		<li>interest-rate risk on the insurer’s net gain from operations</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />realized capital gains and losses on the insurer’s capital and surplus accounts</li>
		<li>both realized and unrealized gains and losses on the insurer’s invested assets</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The AVR minimizes the effects of both realized and unrealized gains and losses on an insurer’s invested assets—such as bonds, preferred stock, derivatives, mortgages, common stock, and real estate—when those gains and losses are related to the credit quality of the assets (credit risk), or fluctuations in the prices of equity securities (equity risk). The IMR helps absorb only the realized capital gains and losses on an insurer’s debt securities—such as bonds, mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, and preferred stock—when those gains or losses are caused by changes in market interest rates. In doing so, the IMR helps to protect an insurer’s net gain from operations and capital and surplus from the effects of interest-rate risk.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The market values of an insurer’s invested assets can fluctuate widely. Both the AVR and the IMR act as a buffer to minimize the effects of these fluctuations on an insurer’s capital and surplus accounts. An insurer’s capital and surplus accounts are affected gradually by realized capital gains and losses, thus helping to ensure the stability of these accounts.</p>

	<p class="explanations">When a policyowner uses a dividend to reduce a policy premium, the insurer deducts the policyowner dividend from the premium due to determine the amount owed by the policyowner. The insurer records the accounting entry on the policy anniversary date. If the dividend is greater than the premium due, the policyowner can receive the excess in cash or apply it to another dividend payment option.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A death claim is a request for payment upon the death of the insured, under the terms and conditions of a life insurance policy. Most life insurance policies provide for payment of the policy’s face amount upon the insured’s death. However, in certain cases, the actual amount of the death benefit payable differs from the policy’s face amount. For example, universal life insurance policies may provide a benefit larger than the policy’s face amount. In these cases, the insurer makes adjustments to the amount payable to a policy beneficiary. Accounts typically used to record and report death benefit payments include <em>Death Benefit Payments</em>, <em>Death Claims Paid</em>, or <em>Claim Settlements</em>.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A supplementary contract, also known as a settlement contract, typically arises from the election of a settlement option by a life insurance beneficiary. Payments on supplementary contracts typically are called contractual payments.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In addition to the typical lump-sum settlement of policy proceeds, insurers provide settlement options, which are alternative methods that the beneficiary can elect for receiving payment of the policy proceeds. Typical settlement options for individual life insurance policies are the interest option, fixed period option, fixed amount option, and life income option.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">When the Staunch Life Insurance Company receives an application and an initial premium payment for a life insurance policy, Staunch typically posts the premium payment to a liability account, because Staunch either lacks critical information about the premium payment or cannot accept the premium immediately as income until a particular event occurs. This information indicates that Staunch most likely would record receipt of the initial premium payment as a debit to</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The accounting entry to record an insurer’s receipt of a premium typically includes a debit to <em>Cash</em>. and a credit to <em>Premium Income</em>. Sometimes the insurer is not able to determine immediately the credit entry to offset the debit to <em>Cash</em>. In this situation, many insurers credit a premium suspense account, such as <em>Premium Suspense</em>, which is a liability account.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Premium suspense accounts are used to record transactions that are intended as premiums, but that the insurer cannot accept as income until a particular event occurs, such as premium payment amounts (1) for renewal premiums, (2) that differ from the amounts in the insurer’s records, or (3) that lack critical information—a policy number or an underwriting decision on a new policy.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, upon underwriting and approval of the application, Staunch would debit <em>Premium Suspense</em> and credit <em>Premium Income</em> to record a suspensed premium to a premium income account. The end result of these two accounting entries is a debit to <em>Cash</em> and a credit to <em>Premium Income</em>—the typical accounting entry to record an insurer’s receipt of a premium.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, when an insurer receives premiums before they are due, but which are due on or after the next policy anniversary date, the insurer reports these premiums as premiums paid in advance on the insurer’s U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements. <em>Premiums Paid in Advance</em> is (<strong>an&#160;asset / a liability</strong>) account.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">In the United States, when an insurer receives premiums before they are due, it reports a liability for premiums paid in advance on its U.S. GAAP and statutory financial statements. For life insurance contracts, premiums paid in advance, also called advance premiums, are premiums that an insurer has received but that are due on or after the next policy anniversary date.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Sometimes included in the category of premiums paid in advance are premium deposits, which, in this context, are amounts that an insurer’s policyowners leave on deposit with the insurer to pay for several years of premiums at one time. Because the insurer has the use of these policyowner funds before they are due, it typically discounts the premiums—in effect, receiving a smaller amount in cash.</p>

	<p class="explanations">However, a more common approach is to place premium deposits in a liability account known as a premium deposit fund. Under this approach, when an individual premium becomes due, the insurer pays it from the premium deposit fund and credits <em>Premium Income</em>.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, deposit-type contracts that lack a mortality risk component—meaning, contracts that provide benefit payments that do not depend upon the death or continued survival of an individual or group of individuals—include GICs, annuities certain, supplemental contracts without life contingencies, and dividend accumulations. For deposit-type contracts, amounts received as payments are not considered premium income (revenue) but instead are reported directly to the appropriate liability account on the insurer’s statutory balance sheet, known as <em>Liability for deposit-type contracts</em>.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under GAAP, accounting for investment contracts—examples include GICs and most deferred annuity contracts during the accumulation phase—is similar to accounting for interest-bearing or other financial instruments where the balance accrues to the benefit of the policyowner or contract owner. Under this approach, premiums or deposits received for investment contracts are recorded as a deposit liability rather than as revenue. A typical GAAP account title for this liability is <em>Funds held under deposit contracts</em>.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Most insurers maintain a separate file for each agent to track unpaid but owed commissions, and report the cumulative amount to an aggregate liability account such as <em>Agent Commissions Due or Accrued</em> or <em>Producer Commissions Due or Accrued</em>.

	<p class="explanations">An insurer’s typical capital accounts under U.S. GAAP include <em>Common Stock</em>, <em>Preferred Stock</em>, <em>Additional Paid-in Capital</em>, <em>Retained Earnings</em>, <em>Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income</em>, and <em>Treasury Stock</em>. Stock insurers in the United States also have statutory capital accounts, such as <em>Common Stock</em>, <em>Preferred Stock</em>, <em>Gross Paid-In and Contributed Surplus</em>, and <em>Treasury Stock</em>. Two important statutory surplus accounts for insurers are <em>Special Surplus</em> and <em>Unassigned Surplus</em>.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Several differently-named U.S. GAAP accounts are similar to SAP accounts. For example, if the selling price of an insurer’s stock issue is greater than the stock’s par value, insurers in the United States also credit <em>Additional Paid-In Capital</em> (U.S. GAAP) or <em>Gross Paid-In and Contributed Surplus </em>(SAP) for the excess of the selling price over the par value. Also, the <em>Unassigned Surplus</em> account under statutory accounting is similar to the <em>Retained Earnings</em> account under U.S. GAAP in both accounts represent the accumulation of income not paid out in dividends.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Under U.S. GAAP, increases in the <em>Treasury Stock </em>account <strong>(decrease / increase) </strong>an insurer’s capital because <em>Treasury Stock </em>is a type of contra equity account.

		<li>increase / <em>Common Stock</em></li>
		<li>increase / <em>Retained Earnings</em></li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations"><em>Treasury Stock</em> is a contra equity account, because its companion account—<em>Common Stock</em>—is an owners’ equity account. Because amounts in a contra account typically decrease the amount in the companion account, under U.S. GAAP, increases in the amount in <em>Treasury Stock</em> decrease the amount in <em>Common Stock</em>, thus decreasing an insurer’s capital.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under statutory accounting, the purchase of treasury stock reduces an insurer’s total surplus. For this reason, an insurer typically must obtain regulatory approval to purchase treasury stock. On the Annual Statement, an insurer reports treasury stock at the bottom of the <em>Liabilities, Surplus and Other Funds</em> page, in the special section on capital and surplus.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Treasury stock is stock that an insurer in the United States had previously issued (sold) and then later repurchased at its market price. Under U.S. GAAP, the basic accounting entry to record the purchase of treasury stock, when the insurer intends to retire the stock, is a debit to <em>Treasury Stock</em>, a debit to <em>Additional Paid-In Capital</em>—<em>Treasury Stock</em>, and a credit to <em>Cash</em>. In the case of retired stock, the insurer deducts the number of shares and their monetary value from the capital account.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Special surplus, also called special surplus funds, assigned surplus, appropriated surplus, earmarked surplus, or contingency reserves, consists of the part of the insurer’s surplus that the insurer’s board of directors has set aside to (1) meet unforeseen contingencies or (2) pay for certain extraordinary expenses. Amounts in the <em>Special Surplus</em> account are not available for distribution to owners, nor do they replace an insurer’s obligation to establish liabilities for expected occurrences.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Unassigned surplus, also called unassigned surplus funds, divisible surplus, or free surplus, is the total amount of undistributed and unapportioned surplus remaining in the insurance company since the company began operations. Unassigned surplus is available to meet any contingency that arises, including new business, outstanding debt, or the purchase of treasury stock or retired stock. The <em>Unassigned Surplus</em> account under SAP is similar to the <em>Retained Earnings</em> account under U.S. GAAP.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Uncollected income is income, including uncollected premiums on individual life insurance, that is due before the financial reporting date, but which the insurer has not received as of the financial reporting date. Uncollected income is reported as an asset.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, Mr.&#160;Rojik’s unpaid premium is uncollected income, but it is not an unearned premium. An unearned premium is a subset of collected income that is received in one reporting period but has not yet been earned; the premium is applicable to insurance coverage to be provided in the following period. Unearned income is reported as a liability.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Selena Yanez is the policyowner of a life insurance policy with the Bulwark Life Insurance Company. The policy anniversary date is October 31, and the $600 semiannual premium payments are due on April 30 and October 31. This year, Ms.&#160;Yanez made her first semiannual premium payment on October 31, and her second $600 semiannual premium payment on April 30 of the following year. The following statements are about Bulwark’s accounting and reporting associated with Ms.&#160;Yanez’s premium payments. Select the answer choice containing the correct statement.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>Upon receiving Ms.&#160;Yanez’s October 31 semiannual payment, Bulwark recorded the $600 as deferred income.</li>
		<li>If Ms.&#160;Yanez had not paid her $600 semiannual premium by October 31, Bulwark would have recorded $600 as deferred income as of that date.</li>
		<li>On December 31, Bulwark reported $200 of Ms.&#160;Yanez’s October 31 semiannual payment as unearned income because this amount applies to insurance coverage after December 31.</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Upon receiving Ms.&#160;Yanez’s October 31 semiannual payment, Bulwark records the $600 as collected income, which is the amount of income, including certain adjustments, received in cash during an accounting period.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Collected premium income can have both an earned portion and an unearned portion. In this situation, on December 31, Bulwark reported $200 as earned income and $400 as unearned income from Ms.&#160;Yanez’s $600 October 31 payment. Unearned income applies to insurance coverage after December 31.</p>

	<p class="explanations">If Ms.&#160;Yanez had not paid her premium by October 31, Bulwark would have recorded $600 as uncollected income—income that is due before the financial reporting date, but which the insurer has not received as of that date—October 31, in this situation. Under U.S. SAP, Bulwark reported Ms.&#160;Yanez’s April&#160;30 semiannual payment as deferred income, because it was due after the financial reporting date (December&#160;31) but before the next policy anniversary date (October 31).</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Accrued income, which is income the insurer has already earned but which is receivable after the end of the accounting period, typically applies to premium income accounts.</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. Accrued income typically applies to investment income—interest or dividends on an insurer’s invested assets that is legally collectible by the insurer. Premium income typically is not classified as accrued income because individual policyowners have no legal obligation to pay premiums. Accrued income has been earned by the insurer, but it has not yet been received; it is classified as an asset on the insurer’s balance sheet.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Deferred premiums typically apply to premium payments that are made more frequently than annually—for example, monthly or quarterly. Deferred premiums have not been received nor have they been earned by the insurer; they are classified as an asset on the insurer’s balance sheet.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The primary function of an insurer’s premium accounting system is to apply premiums to the appropriate accounts as soon as the insurer receives the premiums. The following statement(s) can correctly be made about an insurer’s typical premium income transactions:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>The basic accounting entry to record the receipt of premium income on most insurance products is a debit to <em>Premium Income</em> and a credit to <em>Cash</em>.</li>
		<li>Premium accounting systems calculate premium income on an accrual basis in order to determine the amount of premium income that the insurer earned during the fiscal year.</li>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. The amount of premium income an insurer earned during the fiscal year generally differs from the amount of premium income the insurer collected during the same period. This difference is due to various adjustments to income resulting from unearned premiums and premium income that is due but has not been received by the financial reporting date. In addition, premium income may in some cases be classified as a liability under U.S. SAP and U.S. GAAP.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is correct. The basic accounting entry to record the receipt of premium income on most insurance products is a debit to <em>Cash</em>, an asset account, and a credit to a revenue account, such as <em>Premium Income</em>. A debit to a cash account increases an insurer’s assets and a credit to an income account increases an insurer’s revenues.</p>

When the insurer receives the income, it records the amount of the income as a debit to <em>Cash</em> and a credit to <em>Investment Income Due and Accrued</em>.</p>

Describe the accounting entries associated with typical premium income transactions and investment income transactions in life insurance companies; (2) 10C.

		<li>operating expenses</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Contractual benefit expenses, which are typically the largest expense for insurers, include death benefit payments, cash surrender payments, and annuity benefit payments. When an insurer sells an insurance policy or annuity contract, the insurer becomes legally obligated to pay the benefit amount associated with that product if certain conditions are met.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers also incur operating expenses that are similar to those incurred by noninsurance companies. Operating expenses, such as acquisition, development, maintenance, and overhead expenses, arise in the normal course of conducting business.</p>

Maintenance expenses, which are the product-related costs incurred on in-force policies and contracts, include customer service operating expenses, renewal commissions, and some agency or branch office expenses.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Two other types of operating expenses are development expenses and overhead expenses. Development expenses, which are the costs related to designing, testing, and implementing a new product, include new administrative software expenses and new business license fees. Overhead expenses, which are the costs of normal business operations that are not directly connected with any product, include utility expenses, some agency or branch office expenses, and some information systems expenses.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">An insurer’s income statement typically contains summary information that shows the total amount of commissions earned by and paid to all agents. For financial reporting purposes, an insurer establishes a control account that summarizes accounting entries and monitors the expenses that are reported in a company’s financial statements. A typical control account, called <em>Agents Ledger Control</em> or <em>Producers Ledger Control</em>, includes commissions owed to agents as well as amounts agents owe to the insurer.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The amount of the agent commission is an account payable, which is a short-term liability because the insurer expects to pay the agent within the current accounting period. In this situation, upon payment of the earned commission to the agent, Paragon debits <em>Agents Ledger Control </em>and credits <em>Cash</em>. The combined effect of both transactions is an increase in <em>Commissions Expense</em> (an expense account) and a decrease in <em>Cash</em> (an asset account).</p>

	<p class="explanations">A direct writer pays periodic premiums to the reinsurer when ceding part of the insurance risk on a block of insurance policies to a reinsurer. Commissions that the reinsurer pays to the direct writer are called reinsurance allowances, also known as reinsurance commissions, which are payments intended to cover all or part of the direct writer’s acquisition costs and other costs related to the reinsured business. In effect, the reinsurer pays a commission on this new business to the direct writer, rather than to an agent.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In this situation, Merry would reduce the amount of the $900 reinsurance premium by the $750 reinsurance allowance, which results in $150, the amount of money Merry pays to the reinsurer.</p>

		<li>premium taxes are calculated at the same rate for both life insurance premiums and annuity considerations (premiums)</li>
		<li>all states use a uniform definition of what constitutes paid premium income for tax purposes</li>
		<li>all states apply premium taxes equally to all types of insurers, including fraternal benefit societies</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The definition of what constitutes paid premium income for tax purposes varies among jurisdictions. Some U.S. states impose the tax on gross premiums. Most states allow insurers to deduct policyowner dividends from their gross premiums before calculating premium taxes.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The formula that determines premium taxes due from an insurer typically excludes investment income and reinsurance premiums. Many U.S. states do not impose premium taxes on annuity considerations (premiums). Some states require that the insurer pay the larger of the premium tax or the state income tax. Fraternal benefit societies are typically exempt from premium taxes.</p>

	<p class="explanations">An insurer’s typical accounting entry to record the liability for incurred premium taxes is to debit <em>Premium Tax Expense</em> and credit <em>Premium Taxes Payable</em>. To record the payment of premium taxes, the insurer would debit <em>Premium Taxes Payable</em> and credit <em>Cash</em>.</p>

	<p class="explanations">When a ratio is expressed in fraction form, the number on the top part of the fraction is the numerator and the number in the bottom part of the fraction is the denominator. The rules for interpreting changes in ratios when the ratios are expressed in fractions are as follows:</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, an insurance-specific liquidity ratio is the nonadmitted assets ratio, which compares an insurer’s nonadmitted assets to its surplus: Nonadmitted Assets ÷ Surplus. Nonadmitted assets comprise an insurer’s highly illiquid assets. In general, the lower the value for this ratio, the better, because a lower value indicates that the insurer has a smaller amount of nonadmitted assets. Vista’s nonadmitted assets ratio at the end of last year is equal to $22,000 ÷ $300,000 = 0.0733 or 7.3%.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The basic leverage ratio focuses on a company’s debt obligations in relation to its ability to meet those obligations: Liabilities ÷ Capital. Life insurance companies typically have little or no debt in the form of borrowed money that must be repaid with interest. Instead, they have a significant amount of their liabilities in the form of reserves for contractual benefits.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Thus, a more meaningful leverage ratio for insurers replaces (1) liabilities with contractual reserves and (2) capital with capital and surplus. The insurance leverage ratio, also called the gross leverage ratio, compares an insurer’s contractual reserves to its capital and surplus: Contractual Reserves ÷ Capital and Surplus. Vista’s insurance leverage ratio at the end of last year is equal to $1,600,000 ÷ $460,000 = 3.48.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The investment yield ratio, also called the net yield, shows how efficiently the insurer used its invested assets to earn a return.

		<li>general expense ratio, which is a leverage ratio</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers use several types of ratios to measure their operating performance, such as the general expense ratio, the benefits ratio, and the lapse and surrender ratio. Insurers generally use statutory data to calculate these ratios, because this data is more conservative than is GAAP data. The general expense ratio expresses, for a given reporting period, an insurer’s general insurance expenses as a percentage of premiums, annuity considerations, and considerations on supplementary contracts with life contingencies.</p>

	<p class="explanations">General insurance expenses include rent, salaries and wages, legal fees, medical examination fees, advertising, and rental of equipment, but they do not include contractual benefit expenses. The lower the general expense ratio, the better. A general expense ratio below 100 percent indicates that the insurer is collecting more premiums and considerations than it is paying out in general insurance expenses.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The Stateside Company borrowed funds at a fixed interest rate of 7%, and used the borrowed funds to invest in securities that earned an 8% return. In this situation, Stateside experienced the type of leverage known as</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>negative operating leverage</li>
		<li>negative financial leverage</li>
		<li>positive operating leverage</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />positive financial leverage</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The relationship between leverage, risk, and returns (earnings) is such that, as a company’s leverage increases, the company’s exposure to risk of loss increases, and the company’s potential for earnings also increases. Similarly, as a company’s leverage decreases, the company’s exposure to risk of loss decreases, and the company’s potential for earnings also decreases.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The three main types of leverage are operating leverage, financial leverage, and total leverage. Operating leverage is the effect whereby incurring fixed operating costs automatically magnifies a company’s risks and potential returns. Financial leverage is the effect whereby incurring fixed financing costs—usually borrowed funds—automatically magnifies a company’s risks and potential returns. Total leverage is the combined effect of operating leverage and financial leverage.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Leverage can be either positive or negative. The effect of earning a larger profit or higher potential returns as a result of leverage is called a positive leverage effect. The effect of earning a smaller profit, lower potential returns, or incurring a loss as a result of leverage is called a negative leverage effect. When a company experiences negative leverage, it finds itself in a worse position than if it had not taken on the additional fixed costs in the first place. In this situation, Stateside earned a return on its invested funds that was greater than the interest rate Stateside paid on its borrowed funds; therefore, Stateside experienced positive financial leverage.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">One type of financial ratio expresses the relationship between two amounts: (1) the amount of money invested in an insurer by its owners plus the cumulative amount of money that remains in the insurer over time and (2) the insurer’s liabilities.

		<li>profitability ratio</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers measure their financial strength using capital and surplus ratios. Capital and surplus ratios, also called capitalization ratios, are financial ratios used to express the relationship between an insurer’s capital and surplus and its liabilities: Capital and Surplus ÷ Total Liabilities. In general, the higher the value of capital and surplus ratios, the stronger the insurer’s financial position.</p>

	<p class="explanations">One drawback of the basic capital and surplus ratio is that it is based on unweighted values, which result in unweighted ratios. To account for different risk levels, financial analysts typically apply weighted values. One example of a weighted ratio is the risk-based capital (RBC) ratio.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. The insurance leverage ratio, also called the gross leverage ratio, compares an insurer’s contractual reserves to its capital and surplus: Insurance Leverage Ratio = Contractual Reserves ÷ Capital and Surplus. For this ratio, a low result, such as a range of 4.0 to 6.5, is generally more desirable than a high result.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is incorrect. The debt-to-surplus ratio measures the relationship between an insurer’s total liabilities and its surplus: Debt-to-Surplus = Total Liabilities ÷ Surplus. This ratio is especially important for mutual insurers and fraternal insurers, because they have no capital accounts but do have surplus. In general, insurers aim to have a low debt-to-surplus ratio, such as between 4.0 and 6.5.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is correct. The lapse and surrender ratio compares the number of life insurance policies or annuity contracts that either lapsed or were surrendered during the current year to the average number of policies in force during the current year: Lapse and Surrender Ratio = # of Policies Lapse or Surrendered during Current Year ÷ Average Number of Policies in Force during Current Year. Lapse and surrender ratios can vary from product to product. Generally, an insurer wants its lapse and surrender ratios to match those specified by actuaries when they priced the product. In recent years, the industry average for this ratio has been between 5 and 6 percent.</p>
