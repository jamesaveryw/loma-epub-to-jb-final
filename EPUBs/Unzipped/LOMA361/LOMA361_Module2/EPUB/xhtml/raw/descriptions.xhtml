                    <p>Insurers must recognize their investment gains and losses on their financial
                        statements. That sounds simple enough, but it is done differently depending
                        on the situation. Let’s look at the different situations.</p>
                    <p>Let’s look at the different situations.</p>
                    <p>Question 1: “Did the company sell the investment during the accounting
                        period?”</p>
                    <p>If yes, then the gain or loss is <u>realized</u>.</p>
                    <p>The insurer must determine the net sales proceeds (NSP): selling price
                        minus commissions or other costs.</p>
                    <p>If the insurer still owns the investment, the gain or loss is <u>unrealized</u>.</p>
                    <p>The insurer must determine, as of the statement date, the investment’s <u>fair value</u>—the
                        amount the insurer could sell the investment for in the current market
                        (not counting commissions).</p>
                    <p>If you sold the investment, you’d ask “how much did I sell it for?” If
                        you still owned the investment, you’d ask “how much <u>could</u> I sell it
                        for?”</p>
                    <p>To determine your gain or loss, compare NSP or fair value to…what?</p>
                    <p>That depends on the type of investment (debt or equity) accounting practice
                        (GAAP or SAP).</p>

                    <p>Question: how often does a bond sell for its par value?</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[Arrow points at $1,000 on the bond.]</p>
                    <p>Answer: almost never!</p>
                    <p>Why? Because market interest rates change all the time and are almost
                        never the same as the bond’s coupon rate.</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[Arrow points at 5% on the bond.]</p>
                    <p>Market interest rates are the rates that investors can get on bonds and
                        other investments in the investment markets.</p>

                        Value.”</p>
                    <p>An existing bond’s price generally changes in a direction that is inversely
                        related to changes in market interest rates. That is, if market interest
                        rates rise, then the prices of existing bonds fall.</p>

                        the bond will sell for less than the par value. This is known as “selling

                    <p>The Beagle Life Insurance Company holds 200 shares of Calico Company stock
                        in its investment portfolio. Suppose Calico declares a $1 per share cash
                        dividend on its common stock on December 1…</p>
                    <p><em>[An arrow appears next to the December 1 date.] </em>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>…</em>for stockholders of record on December 15.</p>
                    <p class="vid-desc">[“December 15: Record Date” appears about a third of the way down the
                        timeline. An arrow appears next to it.]</p>
                    <p>Calico will pay the dividend to eligible stockholders on January 15.</p>

                        timeline. An arrow appears next to it.]</p>
                        <p>Because the record date is December 15, the ex-dividend date for Calico
                            common stock most likely is December 13.</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[“December 13: Ex-dividend Date” appears just above the December 15 marker

                        <p>So, on December 13, Beagle would make the following accounting entry to
                            record the dividend income due and accrued:</p>
                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Investment Income Due and Accrued—</em>
                        </p>

                        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To record cash dividend income due and accrued.</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[“January 22” appears between January 15 and January 31 on the timeline
                            with an arrow pointing to it.]</p>
                        <p>Suppose Beagle receives the cash dividend on January 22. Upon receiving
                            the cash dividend, Beagle would record the following accounting entry:</p>
                        <p
                        style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Cash…<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />……<wbr />….…200</em>

                            <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><em>Investment Income Due and Accrued—</em>
                            </p>
                            <p style="margin-left: 160px;"><em>Calico Common Stock …<wbr />……200</em>

                            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">To record a cash dividend received on common stock.</p>
                            <p>In Beagle’s accounting records, the net effect of these two accounting
                                entries is a debit to <em>Cash</em> and a credit to <em>Dividend Income—Calico Common Stock</em>.</p>
                            <p>The debit to <em>Investment Income Due and Accrued—Calico Common Stock </em>in
                                December is cancelled out by the credit to the same account in January.</p>

                    <p>Statutory accounting focuses on the liabilities side. It allows the insurer
                        to use a modified reserve valuation, so that the first-year reserve is

                    <p>The purpose of both the AVR and the IMR is to allow investment losses

                    <p>The ending balance of both the AVR and the IMR are generally reported

                    <p>Under SAP, nonadmitted assets, such as office equipment, are accorded
                        no value on the Annual Statement.</p>
                    <p>Because they are given no value, you might think they don’t affect an
                        insurer’s surplus. But they do, when they are bought or sold.</p>
                    <p>When an insurer sells a nonadmitted asset…it generally receives cash,
                        an admitted asset.</p>
                    <p>The insurer’s admitted assets increase. Its capital and surplus also increases,
                        to keep the accounting equation in balance.</p>
                    <p>Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity</p>
                    <p>The insurer generally pays cash, an admitted asset…when it purchases a

                    <p>The insurer’s admitted assets decrease. The insurer’s surplus also decreases,
                        to keep the accounting equation in balance.</p>
                    <p>To summarize, reducing (by selling) nonadmitted assets causes both its
                        admitted assets and capital and surplus to increase.</p>
                    <p>Increasing nonadmitted assets causes both admitted assets and capital

                    <p>Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity</p>
                    <p>A surplus note is a special type of financing available only to insurers.
                        It’s a debt security that an insurer can sell to an institutional investor
                        to raise cash.</p>
                    <p>When an insurer sells a surplus note, the cash received increases the
                        insurer’s assets.</p>
                    <p>Under SAP, the surplus note is classified as part of Surplus. So, selling
                        a surplus note increases the insurer’s Surplus, which is part of owners’
                        equity.</p>
                    <p>Under GAAP, the surplus note is classified as a liability. So, selling
                        a surplus note increases the insurer’s liabilities.</p>
                    <p>Repaying interest and principal on a surplus note decreases Cash and decreases…</p>
