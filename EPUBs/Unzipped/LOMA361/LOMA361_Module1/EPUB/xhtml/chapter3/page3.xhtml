<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma361-ch3-h2-4">Financial Statement Concepts</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-29">Two important accounting concepts are the entity concept and the going-concern concept. In a sense, they define what the company is: which pieces make up the company, and how those pieces interact today and will continue to interact in the future.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-5">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma361-ch3-h3-1">Entity Concept</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-30">An <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-entity" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-7" role="doc-glossref">entity</span> is the basic business unit for which a company keeps separate accounting records and prepares reports. An entity may be a person, a partnership, a corporation, an organization, a business, or a portion of a business, such as a corporate subsidiary. A company can define its own accounting entities. The <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-entityconcept" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-8" role="doc-glossref">entity concept</span> states that a company must account separately for the business activities of each business unit. When the company has identified its accounting entities, only the transactions that relate to these entities will typically appear on the company’s financial statements. A very basic expression of the entity concept is the understanding that an individual is a separate entity from the company she works for: she cannot attribute her personal expenses to her company’s accounts, and, in turn, she cannot attribute the company’s expenses to her personal accounts.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-31">In general, when a company controls one or more companies—usually referred to as <em>subsidiaries</em>—these subsidiaries maintain detailed records of their own financial transactions. Under U.S. GAAP, a company with a controlling financial interest—usually more than 50 percent ownership—in a business is required to consolidate its financial reporting. The company therefore summarizes and consolidates the records maintained by its subsidiaries into the financial statements it prepares. Usually, the financial statements are labeled with the name of the entity being represented.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-32">Consolidated financial reporting records the business activities or transactions of a company and each of its majority-owned subsidiaries as a single entity. However, under statutory reporting, the company reports its investment in each majority-owned subsidiary in the Annual Statement as the company would report other investments of a similar type (such as common stock or preferred stock). Statutory reporting considers subsidiaries to be investments because shares of ownership are a marketable asset that the company could sell to meet its obligations to policyowners, even when the cash flow generated by a subsidiary might not be available.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-33">Figure 3.1 shows an example of the entity concept under GAAP and statutory accounting.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch3-h3-2">Going-Concern Concept</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-36">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-goingconcernconcept" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-11" role="doc-glossref">going-concern concept</span> in accounting states that a company should maintain its accounting records to reflect the assumption that the company will continue to operate indefinitely. In other words, accounting records must reflect that the company is not facing liquidation. <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-liquidation" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-12" role="doc-glossref">Liquidation</span> is the process of selling all company assets for cash and using that cash to pay the company’s debts; any funds remaining are distributed to the owners of the business. The going-concern concept is an underlying premise of GAAP. It is not, however, entirely presumed under statutory accounting principles, which follow a modified going-concern concept. The primary objective under statutory accounting is solvency—to ensure that an insurer can meet its current and future obligations.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-37">The going-concern concept affects a company’s financial reporting because this concept</p>

<p class="example-header" id="loma361-ch3-p-40">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma361-ch3-div-10">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-41"><strong>Example.</strong> As a going concern, the Regalia Insurance Company does not liquidate its assets and distribute the proceeds to all policyowners in the current accounting period, regardless of whether the insured is living. Instead, Regalia pays contractual benefits upon receipt of death claims on in-force policies. Thus, Regalia intends to remain a going concern and plans to pay contractual benefits in the future. Also, as a going concern, Regalia decides to prepay its office rent in December to rent offices for January, but can defer the reporting of the <em>Rental Expense</em> account to the January accounting period.</p>
