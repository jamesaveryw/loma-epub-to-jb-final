<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-42">Because insurance companies enter into long-term contracts with their customers, insurers must be able to anticipate future revenues and expenses as accurately as possible. The predictive quality of a company’s accounting information is vital to this purpose. Strong predictive quality relies in part on specified qualitative characteristics. These qualitative characteristics help ensure that a sophisticated analysis of a company’s financial statements will provide an accurate and useful understanding of the company’s financial condition. Here we discuss the impact of these characteristics on a company’s financial statements.</p>

<h3 id="loma361-ch3-h3-3">GAAP Characteristics</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-43">Qualitative characteristics that are particularly important under GAAP include</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch3-ul-9">
	<li id="loma361-ch3-li-30">
	<p id="loma361-ch3-p-44">Understandability</p>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-1">Understandability</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-50">Under GAAP, a company’s financial statements must be understandable. The quality of <em>understandability</em> requires that a company’s financial statements disclose relevant financial information in such a way that interested parties can comprehend the information and make decisions based on it. Such decisions may include buying, holding, or selling the company’s stock; purchasing the company’s products or services; or applying for a job at the company. Of the GAAP characteristics, understandability is often considered the highest-level concept, because relevance, reliability, comparability, and consistency are all necessary for a company’s financial statements to be understandable.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-15">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-2">Relevance</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-51">In accounting terminology, the characteristic of <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-relevance" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-15" role="doc-glossref">relevance</span> requires accounting information to be useful, timely, and likely to affect an interested user’s decisions about a company. Relevant accounting information explains how a company has performed during the past accounting period, helps interested users project how the company is likely to perform in the future, and appears on a timely basis so that users can act on the information. A company generally reports only relevant information in its financial statements. Irrelevant information might cloud or distort the picture of a company’s financial performance or condition.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-16">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-3">Reliability</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-52">Accounting information has the characteristic of <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-reliability" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-16" role="doc-glossref">reliability</span> if it is accurate, objective, and free from bias and misrepresentation. The IASB has referred to this characteristic as “faithful representation.” Reliable accounting information fairly represents a company’s financial strength or profitability. In most situations, preparers compile objective information using a standardized measurement method. Further, the company must record and report accounting information in such a manner that outside experts, such as external auditors and regulators, can verify that the information is truthful and based on objective measurements. Objective measurements are based on source documents and explicitly forbid bias or personal opinion.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-53">Sometimes, relevant information is not reliable. For example, information about a company’s plan to market a new product is <em>relevant</em> because the likelihood of the new product’s success could affect an investor’s decision to purchase the company’s stock. However, information about the financial impact the new product may have on the company is a reflection of management’s expectations for the product, not the product’s actual performance. Thus, the new product information is not <em>reliable</em> because it is not objective and verifiable.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-54">When a conflict arises between relevance and reliability, the information in question is usually left out of financial statements. Generally, the information reported on an insurer’s financial statements is both relevant and reliable. Subjective but relevant information is reported in an accompanying narrative (notes) section of the insurer’s financial statements. Figure 3.3 summarizes this process.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-56">Let’s look at a simple example of such a conflict, which does not always lead to a simple solution.</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma361-ch3-div-20">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-58"><strong>Example.</strong> The Malabar Life Insurance Company recently lost a court case but is currently appealing the decision. In this situation, the court case is relevant, but the financial impact may be difficult to measure reliably in the current accounting period. In this case, Malabar summarized the potential financial impact of either outcome of this case in a note that accompanied its financial statements.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-21">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-4">Comparability and Consistency</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-59">The characteristic of<span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-comparability" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-19" role="doc-glossref"> comparability</span> requires a company’s financial statements to be presented in such a way that interested users can identify similarities and differences in financial information across accounting periods and among different companies. In other words, a company’s financial statements must be comparable both to the company’s statements from earlier accounting periods and to the financial statements of other companies for those same accounting periods.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma361-ch3-div-22">
<p class="example-header" id="loma361-ch3-p-60">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma361-ch3-div-23">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-61"><strong>Example.</strong> In a note to its financial statements, the Gardenia Life Insurance Company explained that it is now reporting certain assets at their current market value rather than their original purchase price. This change improves the comparability of Gardenia’s financial statements over time, as a user can compare these assets’ values with their values in previous years. It also makes Gardenia’s balance sheet more readily comparable with the balance sheets of other life insurance companies that report these assets according to current market value.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-62">Consistency is both an important qualitative characteristic under statutory accounting principles and a key component of comparability under GAAP. In accounting terminology, <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-consistency" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-20" role="doc-glossref">consistency</span> means that a company applies the same accounting policies and procedures to the accounting information in its financial statements from one accounting period to the next, unless there is a sound reason for changing a specified policy or procedure.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-63">Comparability and consistency are interrelated because they both require a company to use the same accounting policies and procedures from one accounting period to the next, unless a valid reason to make a change exists. As with comparability, consistency requires a company to disclose the nature and impact of any changes to its accounting policies and procedures. Consistency enables interested parties to compare a company’s financial performance over time. Consistency has two aspects: a company must record</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch3-ul-10">
	<li id="loma361-ch3-li-34">
	<p id="loma361-ch3-p-64">Similar transactions the same way from transaction to transaction</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma361-ch3-li-35">
	<p id="loma361-ch3-p-65">Financial information the same way from one accounting period to the next</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-66">In some situations, accounting offers more than one acceptable method for assigning a monetary value to an account’s balance. For example, the valuation method used for an insurer’s bond holdings does not have to be the same valuation method used for an insurer’s real estate. However, the method chosen for valuing the insurer’s bond holdings or real estate must be applied consistently across all accounting periods.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-67">A company can also change the accounting methods it uses from one accounting period to the next if the company describes the financial effects of the change. The change, and the reason for the change, should be disclosed in notes attached to the financial statements. An insurer typically changes accounting methods because of changes in</p>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-5">Materiality and Cost-Effectiveness</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-73">GAAP qualitative characteristics also must work within the constraints of materiality and cost-effectiveness. <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-materiality" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-21" role="doc-glossref">Materiality</span> means that companies must report all significant information in their financial statements. Generally, an item of information is significant or material if its reporting, the lack of its reporting, or its misrepresentation could affect decisions made by interested users.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-74">Whether information is material or not relies heavily on the judgment of a company’s accountants and management. The materiality of specific items or entries can also vary from company to company. For example, $20,000 of office supplies probably is not a material asset to a $50 billion company, yet this same asset probably is material to a $1 million company. Insurers usually consider several factors about a transaction, as well as the types of accounts the transaction affects, in evaluating whether accounting information about the transaction is material.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-75">Although insurers should report all material information, they should capture this information in a cost-effective manner. The quality of <em>cost-effectiveness</em> means that a company considers the money spent to achieve the desired goals. A company should not incur huge expenses to record and report material accounting information. A given transaction’s materiality can be a judgment call. Let’s look at an example of how materiality and cost-effectiveness affect an insurer’s accounting information.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma361-ch3-div-27">
<p class="example-header" id="loma361-ch3-p-76">EXAMPLE</p>

<p class="inner" id="loma361-ch3-p-77"><strong>Example.</strong> Last year, the Alder Insurance Company purchased new computers for one of its divisions. The new computers significantly improved turnaround time for processing the division’s customer transactions. The costs incurred for the computers were relatively small amounts, when compared with the division’s budget, and Alder was able to capture the costs inexpensively in its automated accounting system. Alder’s management team determined that the cost of the computers was material and cost-effective to obtain and report. As a result, Alder included the costs incurred for purchasing the computers in its financial statements.</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-29">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-6">Conservatism</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-83">In contrast to GAAP-based accounting, under SAP, a life insurance company must report its accounting information in a conservative manner. In this context, <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-conservatism" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-22" role="doc-glossref">conservatism</span> is a prudent reaction for dealing with uncertainty in accounting records and reports. In practice, the use of conservatism typically understates the values of a company’s assets and revenues and overstates the values of the company’s liabilities and expenses. Insurers apply conservative accounting methods only if such conservatism does not violate other accounting qualities, such as relevance or reliability.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-84">According to the quality of conservatism of accounting information, a company</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch3-ul-13">
	<li id="loma361-ch3-li-42">
	<p id="loma361-ch3-p-85">Records revenues only when they are certain</p>
	</li>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-91">Under conservatism, as compared with other financial reporting approaches, insurers typically report account values based on</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma361-ch3-ul-14">
	<li id="loma361-ch3-li-46">
	<p id="loma361-ch3-p-92">Higher mortality rates for life insurance policies</p>

	<p id="loma361-ch3-p-95">Lower interest rates for investment earnings on assets that support life insurance policy reserves and annuity reserves</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-96">Regulators require conservative accounting methods to ensure that an insurer’s contractual reserves and surplus are more than adequate to protect policyowners and beneficiaries from adverse financial conditions. The following example shows how an insurer would incorporate conservatism into its financial reporting.</p>

<div class="example" id="loma361-ch3-div-32">
<p class="example-header" id="loma361-ch3-p-97">EXAMPLE</p>

<div class="inner" id="loma361-ch3-div-33">
<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-98"><strong>Example.</strong> The Watership Life Insurance Company is evaluating the first-year revenues and expenses for a new variable annuity product. Watership is uncertain that it will receive product revenues from a particular client, although the client has signed a contract to pay an amount that represents 2% of Watership’s revenues. In addition, Watership has incurred, but has not yet paid, product expenses that represent 3% of its total expenses. To comply with the conservatism requirement under statutory accounting principles, Watership reports the product’s expenses, but does not report the uncertain revenue from the client. Therefore, Watership is potentially overstating product expenses by 3% and understating product revenues by 2% in its statutory financial statements.</p>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-99">Because U.S. GAAP does not encourage conservatism, in preparing its GAAP financial statements, Watership will report both the unearned revenues and the expenses payable for the variable annuity product.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="txt" id="loma361-ch3-p-100">Under U.S. GAAP, the use of conservatism is considered biased and inconsistent with qualitative characteristics such as reliability and comparability.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-34">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-7">Consistency</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-101">The qualitative characteristic of consistency is much the same when applied to statutory accounting as it is when applied to GAAP-based accounting. Regulators require meaningful, comparable financial information when determining an insurer’s financial condition. Therefore, a company’s accounting policies and procedures should remain consistent.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma361-ch3-div-35">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma361-ch3-h4-8">Recognition</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma361-ch3-p-102">In accounting terminology, <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-recognition" epub:type="glossref" id="loma361-ch3-span-25" role="doc-glossref">recognition</span> refers to the process of classifying an item in a financial statement as an asset, a liability, owners’ equity, a revenue, or an expense. Generally, a company recognizes revenue when a product is sold, when a service is completed, when cash changes hands, or when the legal ownership of a product passes from the company to a customer as part of a business transaction.</p>
