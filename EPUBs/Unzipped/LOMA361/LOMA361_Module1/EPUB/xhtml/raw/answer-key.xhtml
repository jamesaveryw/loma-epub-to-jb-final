	<p class="q-stem-static">Internal and external users of an insurer’s financial information can have a direct financial interest or an indirect financial interest in the insurer. Select the individual user of the Scout Life Insurance Company’s financial information who is an <em>external</em> user with an <em>indirect</em> financial interest in Scout.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>Rita Myrick works in Scout’s underwriting division.</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Cole Nance works for a rating agency that compiles data about Scout and other life insurance companies.</li>
		<li>Sonya Oram owns stock in Scout.</li>
		<li>Tom Phan serves on Scout’s board of directors.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Internal users of a company’s financial information include the company’s employees, directors, and officers. Internal users typically have a direct financial interest in the company, which means they can gain or lose money as a result of the company’s financial performance.</p>

	<p class="explanations">External users of a company’s financial information are people and organizations outside the company who use the company’s financial information to make various decisions about the company. These users can have either a direct financial interest or an indirect financial interest in the company’s performance. External users who have an indirect financial interest in a company’s financial information are seeking a company’s financial information on behalf of others.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Sometimes an individual or entity is both an internal user and external user, such as an individual who is both an employee and a policyowner, insured, or stockholder of the insurer. An external user may have a direct financial interest and an indirect financial interest in the insurer, such as an individual who is both a beneficiary of a policy issued by an insurer and an employee of the state insurance department that oversees that insurer.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Two major fields of accounting are financial accounting and management accounting. Financial accounting focuses primarily on reporting a company’s financial information to meet the needs of the company’s <strong>(internal / external)</strong> users. The field of accounting that focuses primarily on identifying, measuring, analyzing, and communicating financial information to a company’s internal users, so they can decide how to best use the company’s resources, is <strong>(financial / management)</strong> accounting.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Using financial accounting, a company’s accountants communicate the results of the company’s numerous business transactions on financial statements. Unlike management accounting, financial accounting is subject to specific accounting standards and is required by law. Financial accounting focuses on evaluating a company’s past performance.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Management accounting focuses on planning the company’s future performance. Management accounting activities help to analyze operating costs, oversee budgets, and evaluate the profitability of various products and services.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 1B. Distinguish between financial accounting and management accounting, and between generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and statutory accounting principles (SAP).</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Many U.S. insurers currently prepare two sets of financial statements—one set based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and a second set based on statutory accounting principles (SAP). U.S. insurers must follow <strong>(GAAP / SAP)</strong> to prepare the Annual Statement. The Annual Statement presents information about an insurer’s financial performance, with an emphasis on demonstrating the insurer’s <strong>(profitability / solvency)</strong>. The insurer’s employees who prepare financial accounting reports and statements, including the Annual Statement, for external users are known as <strong>(public / private)</strong> accountants.</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">GAAP are a set of financial accounting standards, conventions, and rules that all publicly traded companies must follow when summarizing transactions and preparing their financial statements. GAAP focuses on a company’s profitability—the overall degree of success a company has in generating positive returns for its owners—such as the company’s ability to generate profits and increase value.</p>

	<p class="explanations">SAP are accounting standards that all life insurers in the United States must follow when preparing the Annual Statement and other specified financial reports that they submit to state insurance regulators. SAP focuses on a company’s solvency, which is a company’s ability to meet its financial obligations when they become due. Generally, a company is considered solvent if it owns more than it owes.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Public accounting is performed by public accountants, who work for, or are affiliated with, a public accounting company or governmental regulatory authority. Private accounting is performed by company-employed accountants who prepare financial accounting reports and statements for the company’s external users and management accounting reports for the company’s internal users.</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Companies that issue publicly traded securities in countries that have adopted IFRS Standards must prepare their financial statements according to IFRS standards.</li>

		<li>A only</li>
		<li>B only</li>
		<li>Neither A nor B</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. For years, international companies had to comply with separate, and sometimes conflicting, financial reporting requirements in each country in which they conducted business. In response, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) developed IFRS Standards to promote consistency, comparability, and more complete disclosure of the information contained in corporate financial statements.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Foreign companies whose stock is traded in the United States are now permitted—but not required—to use IFRS Standards. A U.S. insurer may be required to use IFRS Standards in certain situations, such as if the insurer is a subsidiary of a foreign company, or if it plans to raise capital from other countries.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers are subject to SEC regulations if they meet the following tests: (1) all publicly traded companies, including stock insurers; and (2) all insurers that sell variable products, such as variable life insurance and variable annuities. Because variable products are investment products as well as insurance products, an insurer that sells variable products is subject to SEC regulation. Under this test, mutual insurers and fraternal insurers that sell variable products are subject to SEC regulation, even though they are not publicly traded stock companies.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers that are subject to SEC regulation generally must submit U.S. GAAP financial statements to the SEC. However, the SEC now accepts a non-U.S. company’s financial statements that were prepared according to IFRS Standards without requiring the company to restate its financial statements according to U.S.&#160;GAAP. Currently, U.S. mutual insurers and fraternal insurers that sell variable products can submit statutory financial statements to the SEC.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The following statement(s) can correctly be made about regulatory agencies and organizations that have a significant impact on accounting and financial reporting for life insurance companies in the United States:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) specifies the format and content of the Annual Statement.</li>
		<li>The SEC has delegated its responsibility for establishing U.S. GAAP to the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).</li>

		<li>A and C only</li>
		<li>B and C only</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. The<strong> </strong>NAIC, a private, non-profit association of the commissioners of all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories, promotes uniformity of state regulation by developing model laws and regulations that serve as guidelines for the states. Although the NAIC has no legislative power, its recommendations and actions strongly influence the individual state insurance commissioners, the state legislatures, and the insurance industry.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. The primary role of the FASB is to establish and promote the use of U.S. GAAP.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is incorrect. The Public Company Auditing Oversight Board (PCAOB) is a private-sector, nonprofit corporation that sets the auditing standards for external auditors of public companies to ensure that audit reports are informative, fair, and independent.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The IRS, a part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, is the governmental agency responsible for enforcing the provisions of laws and regulations concerning income taxes.

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, the NAIC has established a solvency framework of financial tools that enable state regulators to measure and monitor insurer solvency. An important component of this framework is the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS), which consists of two phases: the statistical phase and the analytical phase. One characteristic of IRIS is that</p>

		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />the statistical phase of IRIS involves using statutory data from every insurer’s Annual Statement to calculate 12 financial ratios</li>
		<li>the 12 financial ratios calculated during the statistical phase test an insurer’s financial solvency, but not its profitability</li>
		<li>the analytical phase of IRIS involves a five-year history analysis of every insurer’s Annual Statement</li>
		<li>only large insurers are subject to the statistical phase of IRIS</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The first eight ratios are tests of an insurer’s solvency and profitability. The remaining four ratios assess the insurer’s operations by measuring changes in premiums, product mix, asset mix, and reserving. The ratio results are then compiled in a report.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In the analytical phase, the analyst team evaluates the IRIS ratio results of specified insurance companies. An NAIC working group determines the criteria to be used in targeting specific insurers for the analyst team review. After reviewing the results, the analyst team designates certain insurers as “Level A” (highest priority), “Level B” (lower priority), or “Reviewed, no level” (lowest priority), to identify those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, one tool that insurance regulators use to monitor the solvency of insurers is the financial condition examination. The following statements are about this examination. Three statements are true, and one statement is false. Select the answer choice containing the <strong>FALSE</strong> statement.</p>

		<li>Most financial condition examinations are classified as association examinations.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">This statement is false; therefore, it is the correct response. In most U.S. states, each insurer domiciled in the state must undergo a financial condition examination once every three to five years by the state insurance department. More frequent examinations are conducted if the state insurance commissioner believes they are warranted. The insurer usually bears the cost of a financial condition examination.</p>

	<p class="explanations">One increasingly important source of information for examiners is the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA), an insurer’s internal assessment of the risks associated with its current business plan and the adequacy of its capital resources to support those risks. The NAIC typically requires insurers to undergo an ORSA on at least an annual basis.</p>

		<li>Real estate = $300,000</li>
		<li>Treasury bills = $100,000</li>
		<li>Cash = $500,000</li>
		<li>Equipment = $80,000</li>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Short-term assets, also called current assets, are assets that a company expects to readily convert into cash or consume within the current accounting period, typically one year. Short-term assets generally have high liquidity. Examples of short-term assets include cash, cash equivalents, and Treasury bills. In this situation, Dulcimer’s total short-term assets are equal to $150,000 + $100,000 + $500,000 = $750,000.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Long-term assets, also called noncurrent assets, are assets that a company plans to hold indefinitely or for a long time—generally longer than one year—to generate income. Compared to short-term assets, long-term assets usually take longer to convert to cash and are generally illiquid (the opposite of liquid). Examples of long-term assets include equipment and real estate.</p>

		<li>bonds that an insurer issues</li>
		<li>the insurer’s investments that are available for sale</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">An insurer’s contractual reserves for future obligations are the amounts it expects to pay its policyowners, annuity contract owners, and beneficiaries. An insurer’s investments that are available for sale are assets.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Insurers may categorize their liabilities as either short term or long term. Short-term liabilities, also called current liabilities, are financial obligations that a company must pay in one year or less. Long-term liabilities, also called noncurrent liabilities, are liabilities that a company does not have to pay in full during the current accounting period—usually one year. For an insurer, agent commissions payable is a short-term liability; bonds that the insurer issues—rather than purchases—are a long-term liability.</p>

		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Owners’ equity represents all owner investments—which are residual claims against a company’s assets—in the company.</li>
		<li>A company’s owners’ equity is the sum of the company’s assets and its liabilities.</li>

		<li>Under statutory accounting principles (SAP), the capital portion of owners’ equity is defined as the cumulative monetary amount that remains in the company over time.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">If a company goes out of business, its owners—that is, the stockholders of a stock insurer or the policyowners of a mutual insurer or fraternal insurer—are entitled to whatever remains of the company’s assets after all creditor claims and policyowner claims have been paid. In this sense, owners’ equity is the difference between a company’s assets and its liabilities in the basic accounting equation.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Sometimes, insurance companies replace the term owners’ equity with capital and surplus. Because mutual insurers and fraternal insurers do not have stockholders, they have do not have capital accounts. Therefore, they replace the term owners’ equity with surplus in the basic accounting equation.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Expenses, also known as costs, are the amounts that a company spends in the course of conducting business. The act of paying a policy claim <strong>(increases / decreases)</strong> the insurer’s cash. Any money that results from an excess of the insurer’s total revenues over its total expenses during a specified period is known as <strong>(a net loss / net income)</strong>.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Expenses are a necessary part of doing business, because an insurer cannot generate revenues without incurring expenses. Typical insurer expenses include investment expenses, contractual benefit expenses, and operating expenses. Unlike revenues, which ultimately increase a company’s assets, expenses ultimately decrease the company assets. For example, the act of paying a policy claim (an expense) decreases cash (an asset).</p>

	<p class="explanations">The relationship between an insurer’s revenues and expenses determines the insurer’s net income or net loss. Net income, or net profit, is any money that results from an excess of total revenues over total expenses during a specified period. For example, a net loss is the amount of a company’s total expenses that exceeds its total revenues during a specified period.</p>

		<li>Owners’ Equity = Assets + Liabilities</li>
		<li>Assets = Liabilities – Surplus</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The basic accounting equation, sometimes called the balance sheet equation, expresses the relationship among the three key account classifications that a company reports on its balance sheet: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity. At the end of an accounting period, the insurer closes out all revenue accounts and expense accounts on the income statement and transfers the net income or net loss for the accounting period to the <em>Owners’ Equity</em> account on the balance sheet. Therefore, the basic accounting equation can be expanded to include an insurer’s revenues and expenses: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity + (Revenues – Expenses).</p>

	<p class="explanations">For stock insurance companies, Capital and Surplus can be substituted for Owners’ Equity in the basic accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Capital and Surplus. Because mutual insurers and fraternal insurers have no capital accounts, the basic accounting equation for these types of insurers can be simplified as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Surplus.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">In accounting, accounts are either permanent or temporary. Permanent accounts are balance sheet accounts—asset accounts, liability accounts, and owners’ equity accounts—that have a balance at the beginning of each accounting period. Temporary accounts, also called nominal accounts, are income statement accounts— revenue account and expense accounts—that are closed out to a permanent account at the end of each accounting period and have a zero balance at the beginning of the next period.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Revenues and expenses must be closed out at the end of each accounting period because a revenue earned or an expense incurred in one period pertains only to that period. Therefore, it cannot also be a revenue or an expense in another accounting period. Insurers use closing entries to move the balances in their temporary accounts to permanent accounts at the end of each accounting period. Most temporary accounts are closed out to an owners’ equity account, such as <em>Retained Earnings</em> (GAAP) or <em>Surplus</em> (SAP).</p>

	<p class="explanations">Because increases are recorded as debits to both assets and expenses, these accounts typically have a normal debit balance. Because increases are recorded as credits to liabilities, owners’ equity, and revenues, these accounts typically have a normal credit balance.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Use the expanded basic accounting equation to recall an account’s normal balance: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity + Revenues – Expenses. Add Expenses to both sides of the expanded basic accounting equation: Assets + Expenses = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity + Revenues. Accounts to the left of the equal sign have a normal debit balance; accounts to the right of the equal sign have a normal credit balance.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">A company that uses the going-concern concept in preparing its financial statements assumes that the company</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>is about to be liquidated</li>
		<li>follows a fiscal year of September through August</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />will continue to operate for an indefinite period of time</li>
		<li>will pay its liabilities in full during the current accounting period</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The going-concern concept states that a company’s accounting records must reflect that the company is not facing liquidation. Liquidation is the process of selling all company assets for cash and using that cash to pay the company’s debts; remaining funds are distributed to company owners. The going-concern concept is an underlying premise of GAAP; it is not, however, entirely presumed under SAP, which follows a modified going-concern concept.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The entity concept states that a company must account separately for the business activities of each business unit. An entity is the basic business unit for which a company keeps separate accounting records and prepares reports. A company can identify and define its own accounting entities, and only those transactions that relate to these entities typically will appear on the company’s financial statements.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: 3A. Explain two key financial statement concepts—the entity concept and the going-concern concept.</strong></p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Because insurance companies enter into long-term contracts with their customers, they must be able to anticipate future revenues and expenses as accurately as possible. The predictive quality of a company’s accounting information is vital to this purpose. Strong predictive quality relies in part on specified qualitative characteristics, including relevance, reliability, consistency, comparability, materiality, and conservatism. In this context, accounting information is defined as <em>reliable</em> when it is</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />accurate, objective, and free from bias and misrepresentation</li>

		<li>useful, timely, and likely to affect an interested user’s decisions about a company</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has referred to reliability as “faithful representation.” Reliable accounting information fairly represents a company’s financial strength or profitability. In most situations, preparers compile objective information using a standardized measurement method.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Further, the company must record and report accounting information in such a manner that outside experts, such as external auditors and regulators, can verify that the information is truthful and based on objective measurements. Objective measurements are based on source documents and explicitly forbid bias or personal opinion.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In contrast to GAAP-based accounting, under SAP, a life insurance company must report its accounting information in a conservative manner. Consider the following activities performed by the Vinca Life Insurance Company:</p>

	<ul class="examul">
		<li><strong>Activity A</strong>—Vinca reports gains only when they actually occur.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity B</strong>—Vinca records expenses only when they are incurred.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity C</strong>—Vinca typically reports account values based on higher expense rates for each block of policies, compared to typical expense rates for similar blocks of policies.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity D</strong>—Vinca typically reports account values based on higher mortality rates for annuity contracts, compared to typical mortality rates for annuity contracts.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">With regard to whether these activities demonstrate the accounting concept of conservatism, it is correct to say that Vinca demonstrates the quality of conservatism in</p>

		<li>Activities A, B, C, and D</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />Activities A, B, and C only</li>
		<li>Activity A and Activity D only</li>
		<li>Activity B and Activity C only</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">According to SAP, conservatism is a prudent reaction for dealing with uncertainty in accounting records and reports. Insurers record revenues only when they are certain, record expenses when they are incurred, report losses immediately, and report gains only when they actually occur.</p>

	<p class="explanations">In addition, as compared with other information qualities, insurers typically report account values based on higher mortality rates for life insurance policies, lower mortality rates for annuity contracts, higher expense rates for each block of policies, and lower interest rates for investment earnings on assets that support life insurance policy reserves and annuity reserves.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under SAP, insurers apply conservative accounting methods only if they do not violate other accounting qualities, such as relevance or reliability. In contrast, under U.S. GAAP, conservatism is considered biased and inconsistent with qualitative characteristics such as reliability and comparability.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Seven years ago, an insurer paid $850,000 for an office building. The building’s current market value is $1,000,000. The account maintenance concept that requires the insurer to report the value of the building at $850,000 on its balance sheet is called the</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The cost concept, also called the historical-cost concept, the cost principle, the initial-recording concept, and the acquisition-cost concept, states that companies should report items on the balance sheet and income statement on the basis of their historical cost, which is their original purchase price on the date of purchase.</p>

	<p class="explanations">An asset’s historical cost provides a reliable measure of the asset’s value, because the historical cost is a verifiable figure that will not change. However, an asset’s historical cost may lack relevance because the asset may have significantly increased or decreased in value over time. Companies often use other valuation methods to report the value of assets.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">With regard to the recognition of revenues and expenses, one characteristic of U.S. GAAP is that a life insurance company should recognize</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>all incurred expenses in the current accounting period</li>
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />insurance premiums as they are earned over the lifetime of the insurance policy or annuity contract</li>
		<li>all paid expenses during the current accounting period</li>
		<li>revenues and expenses only when the company receives cash or disburses cash</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under U.S. GAAP, the realization principle and the matching principle work in tandem. A company reports earned revenue under the realization principle. The company also identifies the expenses it incurred to earn that specified revenue and records these expenses under the matching principle.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The realization principle states that a company should recognize revenue when it is earned, regardless of when the company receives the actual payment, so long as a legal and reasonable expectation exists that the customer will remit payment in full. For life insurance companies, revenue recognition applies primarily to the receipt of life insurance or annuity premiums. The matching principle states that a company should recognize expenses as the company earns the revenues related to those expenses, regardless of when the company receives payment for the revenues earned and regardless of when the company actually paid the expenses.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The Balm Insurance Company incurred $12,000 in expenses for employee training costs that cannot be attributed to any revenues earned by the company. Therefore, Balm reported the entire $12,000 expense during the current accounting period. Under U.S. GAAP, the approach to expense recognition that Balm used in this situation is known as</p>

		<li>systematic and rational allocation</li>
		<li>associating cause and effect</li>
		<li>salvage value</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Generally, U.S. GAAP permits three approaches to expense recognition: (1) associating cause and effect, (2) systematic and rational allocation, and (3) immediate recognition. Under immediate recognition, a company recognizes all costs as expenses during the current accounting period. In contrast, under SAP, life insurers generally must use immediate recognition to recognize all incurred expenses—not just expenses for which the insurer cannot match revenues—in the current accounting period, rather than spread these expenses over the accounting periods in which premium income was earned.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under systematic and rational allocation, a company spreads an asset’s cost over its estimated useful life, regardless of when the company receives revenues from the asset. According to the approach of associating cause and effect, expenses that have a direct relationship to specified future revenues are charged to future accounting periods instead of being charged to the current accounting period.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Two major accounting bases are accrual-basis accounting and cash-basis accounting. The realization principle and the matching principle apply under <strong>(both accounting bases / accrual-basis accounting only)</strong>. Accounting regulations generally mandate the use of <strong>(accrual-basis / cash-basis)</strong> accounting for financial reporting purposes.</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Under accrual-basis accounting, a company records revenues when they are earned and expenses when they are incurred, even if the company has not yet received the revenues or paid the expenses. Revenues are recorded according to the realization principle and expenses according to the matching principle.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Under cash-basis accounting, a company recognizes revenues or expenses only when it receives cash or disburses cash. In contrast, under accrual-basis accounting, a company’s financial statements must report cash and non-cash transactions—such as purchases on account—that occur during the accounting period.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The following statement(s) can correctly be made about cash-basis accounting and accrual-basis accounting:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>Cash receipts and cash disbursements are the most important components under cash-basis accounting.</li>
		<li>The purpose of accrual-basis accounting is to record a business transaction when a company incurs a financial obligation or expects to receive a payment.</li>
		<li>Companies that use cash-basis accounting generally must also make adjusting entries to their accounting records at the end of each accounting period to record pending revenues or expenses.</li>

		<li>A and C only</li>
		<li>B and C only</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. Under cash-basis accounting, a company records a cash receipt in the same accounting period in which it receives the cash and a cash disbursement in the same accounting period in which it remits payment. Cash-basis accounting provides an accurate summary of a company’s current cash flows, but does not provide accurate a picture of that company’s obligations or income in the immediate future, which may be significant. Today, accounting software makes it much easier for insurers to maintain their accounting records simultaneously on both a cash basis and an accrual basis.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. Accrual-basis accounting enables interested users of a company’s financial information to view the consequences of a company’s activities, including the company’s earning potential and financial performance. For this reason, accrual-basis accounting is generally regarded as relevant, compared to cash-basis accounting.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is incorrect. Generally, companies that use accrual-basis also must make adjusting entries to their accounting records at the end of each accounting period to match revenues and expenses in their financial statements for that accounting period. In a pure cash-basis system, a company makes no accounting entries to record pending revenues or expenses or non-cash transactions. Instead, the company calculates its net income by subtracting paid expenses from received revenues.</p>

		<li>$218 million</li>
		<li>$408 million</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">According to the basic accounting equation, the monetary amount of an insurer’s total assets must equal the combined monetary amounts of its total liabilities and total owners’ equity: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity. Therefore, Montage’s owners’ equity is equal to the difference between its assets and its liabilities: Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ Equity = $300 million – $108 million = $192 million.</p>

	<p class="explanations"><strong>Learning Objective: (1) 4A. Describe an insurer’s key financial statements and list the account classifications that appear on each financial statement; (2) 2A.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The income statement shows whether a life insurer is profitable. For a specific accounting period, an insurer experiences either net income—Net Income = Total Revenues &gt; Total Expenses—or a net loss—Net Loss = Total Revenues &lt; Total Expenses. In this situation, Montage experienced net income because its total revenues exceeded its total expenses: $40 million – $14 million = $26 million.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">One key financial statement shows a company’s financial condition or position by summarizing the company’s assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity as of a specified date. By definition, this financial statement is known as</p>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li>an income statement, which is considered to be a static report</li>

		<li>a balance sheet, which is considered to be a dynamic report</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">The balance sheet shows a user what a life insurer owns (its assets), what it owes (its liabilities), and what it has retained (its owners’ equity). A company’s balance sheet is considered to be a static report because it provides a “snapshot” of the company’s financial position as of a specified date.</p>

	<p class="explanations">A company’ interested users examine the income statement to identify how an insurer is earning funds (its revenues), as well as how it is spending them (its expenses). The income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of owners’ equity are considered to be dynamic reports because they present the flow of a company’s transactions during a specified accounting period, rather than as of a specified date.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">The following statements can correctly be made about the statement of comprehensive income:</p>

	<ol class="combo" type="a">
		<li>According to the FASB, under U.S. GAAP, a life insurer has two options for reporting unrealized capital gains and losses on its invested assets: (1) in its income statement or (2) in a separate statement of comprehensive income, which immediately follows the insurer’s income statement.</li>
		<li>Comprehensive income (CI) is the total change in equity for a reporting period, excluding changes resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.</li>
		<li>Because other comprehensive income (OCI) is not reported on an insurer’s income statement, it is not included in the calculation of the insurer’s net income.</li>
	</ol>

	<ol class="choices-static">
		<li class="cr"><img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png" /> <img alt="correct response" class="answer-marker correct-ib hide" src="../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png" />A, B, and C</li>
		<li>A and B only</li>
		<li>A and C only</li>
		<li>B and C only</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">Statement A is correct. Life insurers can have substantial capital gains and losses on their invested assets, and these capital gains and losses can be categorized as either realized or unrealized. Realized capital gains and losses on invested assets must be reported on an insurer’s GAAP income statement.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement B is correct. CI, which measures the changes in equity that result from non-owner transactions, is the sum of net income and other items—known as other comprehensive income (OCI)—that are not reported on the income statement because they have not been realized: CI = Net income + OCI.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Statement C is correct. Components of OCI generally come from non-core business operations and one-time or unusual transactions. Examples of OCI include unrealized capital gains and losses on certain investments, gains and losses resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, and actuarial gains and losses related to pensions and other postretirement benefits. If these components were added to net income, the resulting amount could present an inaccurate view of an insurer’s operating performance. To prevent this result, OCI accumulates on the statement of owners’ equity in a section called “accumulated other comprehensive income” or “AOCI.”</p>

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A cash flow statement, also called a statement of cash flows, is a dynamic financial statement that shows a company’s cash receipts, cash disbursements, and the net change in cash during a specified accounting period. It provides information about a company’s change in cash between the company’s current balance sheet and its previous balance sheet.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Last year, the Cooper Life Insurance Company experienced cash flows from the following activities:</p>

	<ul class="examul">
		<li><strong>Activity A</strong>—Cooper received $23 million in premium income and paid $18 million in contractual benefits.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity B</strong>—Cooper paid $110,000 in cash dividends to stockholders.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity C</strong>—Cooper received $195,000 of principal on loan repayments.</li>
		<li><strong>Activity D</strong>—Cooper purchased $237,000 of bonds.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="q-stem-static">Changes in an insurer’s cash inflows and cash outflows occur as a result of three activities: operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

	</ol>

	<p class="explanations">A cash flow is any movement of cash into or out of an organization. In the context of accounting, a cash inflow is a movement of cash into an organization; cash inflows are sources of funds. Examples include premium income, investment income, and fee income. A cash outflow is a movement of cash out of an organization; cash outflows are uses of funds. Examples include payments for contractual policy benefits, ongoing business expenses, and investment purchases, such as Cooper’s bond purchase in Activity D.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Changes in an insurer’s cash flows occur as a result of three activities. Operating activities are transactions that involve a company’s core business operations and that directly determine the company’s net income. Investing activities are transactions that involve a company’s purchases or sales of long-term assets and its lending funds to other companies. Investing activities involve the securities of other companies. Financing activities are transactions that involve borrowed funds and cash payments to or from a company’s owners. Financing activities involve the company’s own securities.</p>

	<p class="explanations">Changes in the accounts on an insurer’s income statement ultimately affect accounts on the insurer’s balance sheet. An increase in an insurer’s revenues (income statement) generally results in an increase in the insurer’s assets (balance sheet), assuming income was received in the same accounting period in which it was earned. Likewise, an increase in an insurer’s expenses (income statement) generally results in a decrease in the insurer’s assets (usually cash on the balance sheet). The amount of a company’s net income or net loss reported on the income statement and the statement of owners’ equity is reflected in the owners’ equity portion of the company’s balance sheet.</p>

	<p class="explanations">The cash flow statement is also linked to the balance sheet. For a given accounting period, the final entry on the cash flow statement—”Cash and cash equivalents as of end of year”—is equal to the amount listed in the <em>Cash and cash equivalents</em> account on the insurer’s balance sheet. Similarly, the statement of owners’ equity (for stock insurers: the statement of stockholders’ equity) is linked to the balance sheet. The end-of-year balances for common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), and total stockholders’ equity match those shown on the balance sheet for each account.</p>

	<p class="q-stem-static">In the United States, insurers must submit a specific document that includes the insurer’s financial information to the NAIC and the insurance regulatory organization in each state in which the insurer conducts business. This document, which must be prepared using statutory accounting principles (SAP), contains data that regulators need to evaluate a company’s solvency and compliance with insurance regulations, is known as the</p>

	<p class="explanations">The NAIC and most state insurance departments require insurers to file the Annual Statement electronically. Although regulators are the primary audience for the Annual Statement, other users include rating agencies, investment analysts, and insurance company’s managers. For example, company managers use Annual Statement data to compare their company’s performance to that of other companies.</p>
