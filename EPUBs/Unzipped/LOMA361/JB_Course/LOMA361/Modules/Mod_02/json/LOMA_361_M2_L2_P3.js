Property taxes are generally payable in advance at specified times during the year. Property taxes accumulate between tax payment dates. Sometimes an insurer purchases real estate for which the taxes have not been paid in advance. In this case, the seller of the real estate either (1) pays to the insurer the amount of any accrued and unpaid taxes or (2) reduces the purchase price by that amount. If an insurer purchases property after the seller has paid the taxes for the current tax period, the insurer must return to the seller the amount of tax applicable to the remainder of the tax period. This concept is similar to the example described in the previous chapter, where the bond seller and the bond purchaser each earn bond interest income during the same interest period."
