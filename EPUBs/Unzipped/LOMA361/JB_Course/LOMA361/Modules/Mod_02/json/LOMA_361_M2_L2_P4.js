When an insurer obtains reinsurance on a policy, the insurer is usually responsible for paying benefits to any and all policy beneficiaries. However, because the reinsurer has assumed a portion or all of the risk associated with the policy, the reinsurer is typically obligated to pay its contracted share of the benefits to the direct writer—in this case, the insurer—to comply with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. The money that the reinsurer is obligated to pay the insurer is an asset to the insurer. Let’s look at a simple example of how an insurer would account for a death claim payment on a reinsured life insurance policy."
