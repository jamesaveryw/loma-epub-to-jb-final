An insurance company complies with accounting and financial reporting requirements by classifying its premium income, investment income, and fee income by individual or group product line and by product type: life, accident and health, credit life, and annuities. Thus, insurers typically credit one of several revenue accounts according to the revenue source, product line, and product type."
