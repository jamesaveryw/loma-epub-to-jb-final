For example, some companies use the term <em>profit center</em> to refer both to profit centers and investment centers. In these companies, a line of business, division, or product line may be either a profit center or an investment center, depending on the amount of direct control the responsibility manager has over costs, revenues, and investment funds. Figure 12.2 shows an example of the organization of responsibility centers in a life insurance company. In this example, we assume that the managers of the individual insurance division have control over capital investment decisions for the division. Note that several responsibility centers that provide shared services—such as IT, legal, accounting, and human resources (HR)—cannot be traced to a specific product line."

For example, the costs of supplies, travel, and overtime pay are controllable costs within a department because the responsibility manager can decide whether or not these costs should be incurred. On the other hand, a <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">noncontrollable cost</span> is a cost over which a responsibility manager has no decision-making authority. One example of a noncontrollable cost is office rent: a responsibility manager cannot control the rent paid or the portion of the rent allocated to her department."

A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">cost object</span> is any purpose for which a company measures costs. Sample cost objects include product lines, employee salaries, customer service, and so on. A simple way to determine whether a cost is a direct cost of a specified cost object is to ask: Would the cost disappear if the cost object disappeared? If the answer is yes, then the cost is a direct cost. For example, the salary of a responsibility manager is a direct cost of that center. In addition, the salary of the manager of an insurer’s group life insurance line of business is a direct cost to that line of business because the salary cost disappears if the insurer eliminates this line of business. Repair and maintenance costs for equipment that is used exclusively in one responsibility center are also direct costs of that responsibility center because these costs would disappear if the equipment were sold or removed from the responsibility center."

Again, ask the question: Would the cost disappear if the cost object disappeared? If the answer is no, then the cost is an indirect cost. For example, the salary of an insurer’s vice president in charge of both the individual life insurance and group life insurance lines of business is an indirect cost from the point of view of the individual life insurance line of business. If the insurer eliminated the individual life insurance line of business, the vice president’s salary cost would not disappear. Overhead expenses are another example of indirect costs."
