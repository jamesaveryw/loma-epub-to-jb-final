When a company carries so much responsibility, it cannot make financial decisions randomly based on hunches and guesswork. All companies, especially those in the financial services industry, need a plan. <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">Budgeting</span> is an accounting process that includes creating a financial plan of action designed to help an organization achieve its goals. As you recall from Chapter 12, a <em>budget&nbsp;</em>is a financial plan of action, expressed in monetary terms, that covers a specified period, such as one year. A budget contains estimates of management’s expectations for the company’s performance over the next period. During the next period, the company can compare its actual results to expectations, and adjust its operations accordingly."
