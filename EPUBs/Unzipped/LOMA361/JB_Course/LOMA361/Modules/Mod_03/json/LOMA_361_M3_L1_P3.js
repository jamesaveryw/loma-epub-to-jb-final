Recall that a life insurance company’s reserves typically are the company’s largest liability. For example, if 40 percent of an insurer’s reserves are attributable to group life insurance, then the insurer allocates 40 percent of its investment income to the group life insurance responsibility center. One potential issue associated with the mean liabilities method is that it does not consider the impact of the surplus required to support a line of business. Newer lines of business may suffer from a lack of resources if they are not allocated a share of the investment income generated by older, high-yielding investments that were purchased before the new products existed. The mean liabilities method is used in preparing the U.S. Annual Statement."

Each line’s share of investment income is determined by the investable funds generated by that line each year. <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">Investable funds</span> consist of (1) net income before taxes, (2) investment income received on prior investments, and (3) the maturities of principal on prior investments. This method overcomes one weakness of the mean liabilities method, as an insurer’s newer lines of business—which have lower amounts of accumulated funds and larger cash outflows from current operations—receive relatively larger shares of investment income from newer investments. In addition, the insurer’s older lines of business—which typically have larger reserves and lower amounts of cash outflows—receive larger shares of investment income from older investments."

The insurer then allocates the investment income from each investment to the line that acquired the investment. Under this method, an insurer can develop separate investment strategies for different lines of business. Such versatility is important because cash flow patterns and investment income requirements differ along lines of business. For example, the cash flows of an insurer’s annuity business differ from those of its whole life insurance business."

A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">transfer price</span> is the price of a good or service that one function or line of business charges another of the same company. For example, the human resources department of an insurer may use transfer pricing to charge the insurer’s group life insurance line of business for employee recruitment or training expenses. Unlike intercompany transactions, in which prices are determined by market factors such as supply and demand, transfer pricing arrangements are intracompany in nature—that is, they are established by a company’s internal management team."

The transfer pricing method that an insurer selects is critical, because transfer prices directly affect the profits for which the responsibility managers of profit centers and investment centers are held accountable. An inappropriate transfer price might result in a misleading evaluation of a responsibility center’s performance. Moreover, inappropriate transfer prices may lead a responsibility manager to make decisions that are not in the insurer’s best interest. A discussion of the process of setting transfer prices is beyond the scope of this textbook."
