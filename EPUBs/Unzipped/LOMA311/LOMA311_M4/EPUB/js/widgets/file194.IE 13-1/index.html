                <p class="statement">Sue Moon died in a crash while piloting an airplane during military service. Ms. Moon was insured by an individual life insurance policy that had an aviation exclusion. This policy provision excluded from coverage any death caused by aviation-related activities while in the military.</p>

                <p class="statement">Stan Wood died two days after his individual life insurance policy began. While evaluating the death claim, the insurer discovered false information on Mr. Wood’s application for insurance that would have caused the insurer to deny the application had it known the truth.</p>

                    <p>The insurer defended the lawsuit on the grounds that the policy was invalid as a result of material misrepresentation in the application.</p>
