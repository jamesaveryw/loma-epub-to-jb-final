            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch12-p-21">The owner of a life insurance policy has the right to transfer ownership
                of some or all of her rights in the policy. She may transfer some of these
                rights by assignment or by means of a policy’s change of ownership provision.
                The owner of an annuity can also transfer ownership of his rights in the
                annuity; we discuss annuity assignments further in Chapter 14.</p>

                    ownership rights in the property by assigning the rights to another. Similarly,
                    a property owner can, by means of an assignment, pledge his rights in personal

                            policy by absolutely assigning it to her. Cynthia became the policyowner,

                    policy, usually to provide security for a debt. A collateral assignment
                    gives the assignee the right to share in the policy proceeds to the extent
                    of the policyowner’s outstanding debt at the insured’s death. When a policyowner
                    repays the debt owed to a collateral assignee during the lifetime of the
                    insured, the assignee’s interest in the policy ends. All of the assignee’s

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch12-p-29">General property law gives the property owner the right to assign property,
                    including a life insurance policy. The owner assigns property by means
                    of a contractual agreement that describes the rights and interests of the
                    assignor and the assignee. An assignment of a life insurance policy is
                    not required to be in writing unless a statute or the policy itself requires
                    it. A written agreement better protects both parties, however, and is therefore
                    common.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-30">Under the terms of an <em>absolute assignment</em> of a life insurance policy,
                    the assignee obtains all of the policyowner’s rights and interests in the
                    policy; the absolute assignee thereby becomes the policyowner. The assignor
                    has no further interest in the policy, and the assignee becomes responsible
                    for premium payments. Also, the assignee is entitled to receive policy
                    dividends (if applicable), as well as to surrender the policy or handle
                    the policy as she wishes.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-31">The terms of a <em>collateral assignment</em> usually restrict the policyowner
                    from dealing with the policy in ways that would affect the collateral assignee’s
                    interest. Collateral assignment agreements usually transfer to the assignee

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-36">In practice, assignees do not exercise these rights unless the assignor
                    fails to repay the loan as required. Collateral assignments usually state
                    that the policyowner retains the right to designate and change the policy
                    beneficiary and the right to select a settlement option.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch12-p-37">A collateral assignment agreement typically does not require the collateral
                    assignee to pay the policy’s renewal premiums. If the assignee does pay
                    such premiums, however, the assignee has the right to recover the amount
                    paid from the policy proceeds. Thus, the amount of premiums the assignee
                    pays is in effect added to the debt the policyowner owes the assignee.</p>

                            assigned her policy to the bank. At the time of her death, Ms. Kannangara
                            owed $15,000 on the loan, and Centurion Bank had paid $2,500 in premiums
                            on her policy. The bank is entitled to receive $17,500 of the policy proceeds,

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-40">According to conflict of laws rules, the validity and effect of an assignment
                        agreement are governed by the laws of the state in which the assignment
                        was made—that is, where the assignor signed the assignment agreement. As
                        in the case of other contractual agreements, the parties to an assignment
                        must have contractual capacity for the agreement to be valid and binding
                        on the parties.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-41">As discussed in Chapter 4, the parties to an assignment contract may include
                        a choice of laws provision in the contract to decide which state’s laws
                        govern their agreement. Life insurance policies, assignments, and other
                        contracts usually specify which laws govern the agreement. If a contract
                        does not specify which laws govern its execution, a court can apply conflict
                        of laws rules.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch12-p-42">When a policyowner assigns his life insurance policy, the rights of the
                        policy beneficiary vary depending on the type of assignment and on whether
                        the beneficiary is revocable or irrevocable.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-43">When a policy that has a <em>revocable beneficiary</em> is absolutely assigned,
                        courts’ decisions concerning the beneficiary designation vary. Some courts
                        hold that the absolute assignment of a policy revokes the beneficiary designation.
                        Other courts have found that the designation remains in effect, but the
                        absolute assignee has the right to change the designation.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma311-ch12-p-44">Because a revocable beneficiary has no legal interest or involvement in
                        a policy during the insured’s lifetime, the collateral assignee’s rights
                        in the policy are superior to the beneficiary’s rights. Thus, the collateral
                        assignee is entitled to be repaid from the policy proceeds even if the
                        revocable beneficiary did not consent to the arrangement.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma311-ch12-p-45">By comparison, an <em>irrevocable beneficiary</em>’s vested interest in
                        a life insurance policy cannot be revoked without the beneficiary’s consent.
                        According to the terms of most policies, when a beneficiary is designated
                        irrevocably, the policyowner cannot transfer ownership of the policy without
                        obtaining the beneficiary’s consent.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-46">When a policy that has an irrevocable beneficiary is absolutely assigned,
                        the beneficiary remains the irrevocable beneficiary unless she consents
                        to a change of beneficiary. In addition, the assignee cannot take out a
                        policy loan or surrender the policy for cash without the irrevocable beneficiary’s
                        consent. The following insight shows two examples of a beneficiary’s rights

                                as security for the loan. A week later, Ms. Kayano died without having
                                told her husband about the assignment.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-50">Because Mr. Kayano was the policy’s irrevocable beneficiary, his vested

                                Mr. Kayano did not consent to the assignment, and thus the $120,000 policy
                                proceeds are payable to Mr. Kayano.</p>

                        property law, an insurer is not required to give policyowners notice of
                        their right to assign their policies. Most individual life insurance policies,
                        however, do include an <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-assignmentprovision"

                        which describes the roles of the insurer and the policyowner when the policy
                        is assigned. Policies typically state that an assignment is not binding
                        on the insurer unless the insurer is notified in writing of the assignment.
                        Consider, for example, a situation in which a policyowner assigns the policy
                        but does not provide written notice of this assignment to the insurer.
                        If the insured dies, the insurer will pay the policy proceeds to the designated
                        beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the policy. Because the insurer
                        did not know of the assignment and paid the policy proceeds in good faith,
                        the insurer would have no further liability under the policy, and the assignee
                        will not be able to enforce a claim against the insurer.</p>

                    id="loma311-ch12-p-54">The typical assignment provision in individual life insurance policies
                        states that the insurer is not responsible for verifying the validity of
                        an assignment of the policy. The insurer is not a party to an assignment
                        and has no control over the validity of such an agreement. If the insurer
                        has received a valid written notice of an assignment, then the insurer
                        usually presumes that the assignment is valid. The insurer typically cannot
                        be held liable if it acts in good faith and in accordance with an assignment
                        that is later declared invalid. In other words, if an insurer pays policy
                        proceeds to an assignee who appears entitled to the proceeds, but the assignment
                        is subsequently determined to be invalid, then the insurer cannot be required
                        to pay the proceeds again to the person who was in fact entitled to them.
                        However, if the insurer had knowledge of circumstances that should have
                        made it question the validity of an assignment, then the insurer may be
                        liable if it acts in accordance with an invalid assignment.</p>

                        take precedence over the rights of an assignee with regard to the policy
                        proceeds. Such a statement highlights the fact that an assignee cannot
                        receive an amount greater than the <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-netpolicyproceeds"

                        any outstanding policy loans and interest have been deducted. An insurer
                        is never obligated to pay any claimant an amount greater than the net policy
                        proceeds, regardless of whether this fact is explained in the policy.</p>

                                a policyowner to transfer all operating rights by notifying the insurer
                                in writing of the change, without having to enter into a separate assignment
                                agreement. When the insurer records the ownership change in its files,
                                the change generally becomes effective as of the date the policyowner signed
                                the written notification.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-62">The change of ownership provision typically gives the insurer the right
                                to require a specific endorsement. In such a case, the policyowner must
                                send the policy to the insurer, which adds an endorsement to the policy
                                stating the name of the new owner. As in the case of a beneficiary change
                                that must be endorsed on a policy, many courts apply the substantial compliance
                                rule to situations in which an ownership change must be endorsed in the
                                policy. If a policyowner has done everything possible to comply with the
                                ownership change procedure set forth in the policy but has failed because
                                of circumstances beyond her control, then such courts would consider the

                                    and the purchaser. The seller must be certain that a viatical settlement
                                    is the proper instrument to meet her needs; in some cases, an accelerated
                                    death benefit or policy loan might be more beneficial, as these options
                                    would allow the policyowner to receive some cash while retaining ownership
                                    of the policy. Also, the lump sum payment for the sale of the policy may
                                    be taxable, depending on the tax laws in the state where the seller resides.
                                    The risk to the purchaser is that the seller might live longer than expected,
                                    thus reducing or even eliminating the return on the purchaser’s investment.

                                            1980s. The typical seller was younger and possessed a life insurance policy
                                            on his own life, often provided by his employer, but needed ready cash
                                            to pay for medical procedures such as experimental drug therapy. Gradually,
