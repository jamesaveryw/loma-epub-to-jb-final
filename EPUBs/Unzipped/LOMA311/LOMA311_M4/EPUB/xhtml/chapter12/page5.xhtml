            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch12-p-118">Sometimes a person purchases a life insurance policy in order to provide
                for a dependent who is, because of age or impairment, unable to manage
                large sums of money. In these circumstances, as well as a number of others,
                a policyowner may name a trust as a policy beneficiary. As we saw in Chapter
                9, a <em>trust</em> is an arrangement in which one person, the <em>trustee</em>,
                holds title to property for the benefit of another, the <em>trust beneficiary</em>.
                The <em>settlor</em> or<em> grantor</em> is the person who creates a trust
                and transfers ownership of property to the trustee, who has a duty to manage
                the property for the trust beneficiary’s benefit. The settlor can deposit
                both real and personal property into a trust.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-119">Ownership of trust property is split between the trustee and the trust
                beneficiary. The trustee has formal <em>legal title</em> to the property
                and, thus, is the legal owner of the property. The trust beneficiary has

                role="doc-glossref">equitable title</span>to the trust property, which means that the beneficiary
                    has ownership rights based on considerations of fairness and equity rather
                    than on legal ownership rights. The insight below further details the difference
                    between legal and equitable title.</p>

                    <p class="title" id="loma311-ch12-p-121">Legal and Equitable Title</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-122">Ownership of trust property is divided into two components: equitable
                        title and legal title. All property has these two ownership interests,
                        although one person may be both the legal and equitable owner of property.
                        An everyday example of this division of interests is when someone purchases
                        an automobile. If the purchaser pays cash for the vehicle, the purchaser
                        has both legal and equitable title to the automobile. However, if the purchaser
                        finances the purchase with a loan from a bank, finance company, or other
                        lender, the lender may physically hold the automobile’s title documentation,
                        or the title documentation may list the lender as a lien holder on the
                        title. In both situations, the lender controls the legal title to the automobile.
                        However, the person who purchased the automobile and borrowed the money
                        to purchase the automobile has an equitable interest in the automobile
                        and gets the economic benefit from it—possession of the vehicle.</p>
                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-123">If the purchaser wants to dispose of the automobile, the two parties have
                        to cooperate; the purchaser has to convey his economic interest, and the
                        lender has to convey legal title. Neither party can sell the vehicle without
                        the other. When the purchaser repays the lender, the lender’s interest
                        in the vehicle ends, and the purchaser thereafter owns both legal title
                        and equitable title.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-124">Ownership rights in a trust are similar to the ownership rights in the
                            automobile. The trustee who holds legal title to trust property may control
                            the timing and the amounts of the property distributions to the trust beneficiaries.
                            Eventually, however, the trust beneficiaries will receive the assets in
                            the trust.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-125">Note that legal and equitable <em>title</em> are distinct from the legal
                            and equitable <em>remedies</em> that we discussed in Chapter Two. Legal and
                            equitable remedies are remedies assigned by a court following a civil suit,
                            while legal and equitable title are inherent aspects of trust ownership.</p>

                    breach of the trustee’s fiduciary duties. If the trustee does not follow
                    the settlor’s instructions in handling the trust property, then the beneficiaries
                    have the right to ask a court to enforce the terms of the trust agreement.
                    The court can then force the trustee to act in accordance with the settlor’s
                    instructions.</p>

                    a trust with that property. Thus, minors typically do not have the legal
                    capacity to create a trust. In the past, a settlor was not permitted to
                    be both the trustee and the sole trust beneficiary. Today, most states
                    permit the settlor to be both the trustee and the trust beneficiary of
                    a trust as long as specific requirements are met.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch12-p-131">Like other contractual arrangements, a trust requires a lawful purpose.
                    When the purpose of a trust is illegal or against public policy, the trust
                    is void and unenforceable. Thus, for example, a settlor may not transfer
                    property as a way to defraud his creditors.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-132">Settlors often create trusts to ensure that their dependents are provided
                    for over a period of time. For example, a person with young children or
                    children who are not capable of managing large sums of money may establish
                    a trust and instruct the trustee to transfer trust assets to the trust
                    beneficiaries only when they reach a specified age or only for specified
                    purposes. A trust may also provide the means to care for children who are
                    mentally or physically incapacitated throughout their lifetimes.</p>

                            He established a trust to hold the life insurance proceeds in the event
                            that he should die while his children are still minors. He names his brother,
                            Gaffar, as the trustee and his children as the trust beneficiaries. Three
                            years later, Mehdi dies in an automobile accident. The trust receives the
                            policy proceeds, and Gaffar manages the policy proceeds for the Shamel

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-135">A trust can also be a useful estate planning tool. In the United States,
                        when someone dies owning a probate estate valued at more than a specified
                        dollar amount, the decedent’s estate is required to pay federal taxes known
                        as <span class="gt" data-term="ch12-gt-estatetaxes" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma311-ch12-span-42" role="doc-glossref">estate taxes</span>. Settlors
                        often establish life insurance trusts to provide funds to pay estate taxes.
                        In such a case, the life insurance policies that are held in trust become
                        payable at the settlor’s death, and those funds can be used to pay any
                        estate taxes payable at the settlor’s death. In addition, if the settlor
                        transferred ownership of the life insurance policies to the trustee, then
                        the policy proceeds payable are not included in the settlor’s taxable estate;
                        thus, the amount of estate taxes owed is reduced.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-136">With proper planning, transferring assets into an irrevocable living trust
                        can reduce the assets in a decedent’s estate and, thus, can reduce the
                        amount of estate taxes payable. In addition, assets that are not part of
                        the settlors’ probate estate are available immediately to provide for the
                        decedent’s dependents without going through the probate process.</p>
                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch12-p-137">A person can also create a trust for charitable purposes. For example,
                        people sometimes transfer ownership of property into a trust that is established
                        for the benefit of an educational or charitable organization. In such a
                        case, the settlor can retain possession of the property during her lifetime;
                        at the settlor’s death, possession of the property is transferred to the
                        designated charity. By establishing a charitable trust, the settlor reduces
                        the amount of her taxable estate.</p>

                                such as signing a written document are required to create a living trust,
                                unless the trust property includes real property. However, the settlor
                                usually drafts and signs a <em>trust agreement</em>, which is a written
                                document that spells out the terms of the trust, including instructions
                                as to how the trustee is to handle the trust property. The trust agreement
                                may name one or more trustees, and it may name a bank or trust company
                                to serve as trustee. The trust agreement may also name a successor trustee,
                                who will assume the position of trustee if the original trustee can no
                                longer serve that function.</p>

                                    a trust that is designed to keep trust property out of the hands of creditors

                                    or otherwise transferring her interest in the trust. This prohibition is
                                    the primary difference between a spendthrift trust and other trusts; most
                                    states permit the beneficiaries of other types of trusts to assign their
                                    interest in the trust. Thus, for example, a trust beneficiary can assign
                                    her interest in a trust as collateral for a loan. By prohibiting such assignments
                                    or other transfers of an interest in spendthrift trust property, a spendthrift
                                    trust protects the trust property from the trust beneficiary’s actions.
                                    In addition, state laws generally prohibit creditors from seizing the property
                                    in a spendthrift trust. After trust assets are transferred to the trust
                                    beneficiary, however, those assets can be seized by the beneficiary’s creditors.
                                    Later in the chapter, we describe how life insurance policyowners can use
                                    a spendthrift trust to protect a policy’s beneficiary.</p>
                                    <p class="txt"
                                    id="loma311-ch12-p-143">To effectively protect the trust beneficiary, a spendthrift trust typically
                                        must be established as an irrevocable trust. In addition, the trustee generally
                                        is given full discretion in handling the trust assets. In most states,
                                        the settlor of a spendthrift trust cannot also be a trust beneficiary.
                                        A few states, however, now permit a person to establish a spendthrift trust
                                        and name himself as the trust beneficiary if certain requirements are met.</p>
