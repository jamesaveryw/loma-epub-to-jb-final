            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-23">The parties to an individual life insurance contract are the insurer that
                issued the policy and the policyowner. Recall from Chapter 4 that individual
                life insurance contracts can be characterized as</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch10-ul-6">
                <li id="loma311-ch10-li-25">
                    <p id="loma311-ch10-p-24"><em>Informal contracts</em> that require no special formalities to be valid</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch10-li-26">
                    <p id="loma311-ch10-p-25"><em>Unilateral contracts</em> under which only one party—the insurer—makes
                        legally enforceable promises</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch10-li-27">
                    <p id="loma311-ch10-p-26"><em>Aleatory contracts</em> under which one party—the policyowner—provides
                        something of value to another party—the insurer—in exchange for a conditional
                        promise</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch10-li-28">
                    <p id="loma311-ch10-p-27"><em>Contracts of adhesion</em> that one party—the insurer—prepares and
                        that the other party—the applicant—must accept or reject as a whole without
                        any bargaining between the parties</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-28">In particular, a life insurance contract is an informal contract. However,
                laws in many states require insurance contracts to be in writing. Insurance
                contracts typically are expressed in written form—whether required by law
                or not—for practical reasons. Putting the contract in writing helps prevent
                misunderstandings between the parties as to the terms of their agreement.
                A written contract also provides a permanent record of the agreement, which
                may remain in force for many years.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-29">As with the formation of other informal contracts, the parties must meet
                four requirements to form a valid life insurance contract: (1) the parties
                must mutually assent to the contract, (2) they must exchange legally adequate
                consideration, (3) they must have contractual capacity, and (4) the contract
                must be for a lawful purpose.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch10-h3-1">Mutual Assent</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-30">The parties manifest their mutual assent to a life insurance contract
                when one party makes a definite offer to contract and the other party accepts
                that offer unconditionally.</p>
            <div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch10-div-11">&#160;</div>
            <h4 id="loma311-ch10-h4-1">Offer and Acceptance</h4>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-31">Applicants for insurance generally make an offer to enter into an insurance
                contract by completing an application for insurance and submitting it to
                an insurer along with payment of the initial premium for the applied-for
                policy. The insurer can accept an applicant’s offer by (1) issuing a policy
                that contains the same terms as those stated in the applicant’s offer and
                (2) delivering the policy to the applicant. When a valid contract is created,
                the applicant becomes the policyowner.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-32">If an applicant does not pay the initial premium when she submits an application
                for insurance, then she has not made an offer. Rather, she has invited
                the <em>insurer</em> to make an offer. The insurer can make an offer to contract
                by issuing a policy and delivering it to the applicant. Note that the policy
                the insurer issues and delivers need not be the same policy the applicant
                applied for. The applicant can accept the insurer’s offer by accepting
                the policy and paying the initial premium.</p>
            <div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch10-div-12">&#160;</div>
            <h4 id="loma311-ch10-h4-2">Counteroffers</h4>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-33">When an insurer issues a policy on terms other than those applied for,
                the insurer has rejected the initial offer and has made a counteroffer.
                An insurer often makes a counteroffer when it classifies the prospective
                insured as a higher risk than the prospective insured has applied for.
                An applicant can accept an insurer’s counteroffer by accepting delivery
                of the policy and agreeing to the new contract terms that the insurer has
                proposed. Watch Video 10.1 for an example of an insurance policy counteroffer.</p>

                    usually can withdraw an offer at any time before the offeree has accepted
                    the offer. Thus, an applicant who has applied for an insurance policy and
                    paid the initial premium has the right to withdraw that offer at any time
                    before the insurer accepts the offer. If an applicant withdraws an offer,

                            that he could purchase a policy more suited to his needs from Green Life.
                            Blue Life had not yet accepted Mr. Hu’s application. Mr. Hu then completed
                            an application for a policy from Green Life and submitted the application.
                            In this situation, Mr. Hu has the right to withdraw his application from
                            Blue Life and to receive a refund of the premium he paid to Blue Life.</p>

                        risk profile. Most insurers prefer to avoid withdrawing such offers, as

                                    standard premium rate. If Mr. Bellini does not want to pay the higher premiums,
                                    he can reject the insurer’s counteroffer and receive a refund of the initial

                            contract. For example, an insurer rejects an application when the insurer’s
                            underwriters find that the proposed insured presents too great a risk to
                            be eligible for insurance. In such instances, the insurer is rejecting
                            an offer to contract. State insurance laws, however, prohibit insurers
                            from unfairly discriminating against proposed insureds because of factors
                            such as race, national origin, marital status, sex, sexual orientation,
                            and certain mental and physical impairments. For this reason, insurers
                            who reject an offer to contract must base that decision on recognized actuarial
                            principles or actual or reasonably anticipated experience. Insurers generally
                            try to offer coverage on some basis to as many proposed insureds as possible.</p>

                                voidable by the minor. When a minor decides to avoid an insurance contract,
                                she is entitled to a refund of the premiums she paid. As a result, the

                                the contract and pays nothing for it. However, this ruling discouraged
                                insurers from entering into life insurance contracts with minors, even
                                if the minors could have benefited from receiving life insurance coverage.</p>

                                contracts. Thus, insurers that provide coverage to minors are protected
                                against a minor’s ability to avoid such a contract, and are therefore more
                                willing to offer insurance to minors. The following are some of the limitations

                                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-53">When the purpose of an agreement is illegal, the agreement is illegal
                                    and void. An agreement’s purpose is illegal if it violates public policy
                                    or violates a principle of common law. To be valid, an informal contract
                                    must have a lawful purpose. In the formation of a life insurance contract,
                                    the lawful purpose requirement is met if an insurable interest is present.
                                    Many early life insurance policies were purchased as wagers by individuals
                                    who had no relationship at all with the insured—in particular, people used
                                    life insurance policies to make a profit on the deaths of public figures
                                    before courts instituted the requirement of an insurable interest.</p>
                                <p
                                class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-54">In addition, the ability to gain substantial profits from an insured’s
                                    death creates the danger of someone insuring another person with the intent
                                    of killing the insured and collecting the policy proceeds. The insurable
                                    interest requirement is intended to prevent such situations and provides
                                    assurance that the insurance contract is being made for the lawful purpose
                                    of providing protection against financial loss, rather than for an unlawful
                                    purpose. Most countries around the world impose an insurable interest requirement
                                    on the formation of life insurance contracts. The insight below provides
                                    a few examples of how the specific requirements for insurable interest

                                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-61">In the United States, for the contract to be valid, a policyowner must
                                        have an insurable interest in the insured person when the life insurance
                                        policy is issued. Generally, an insurable interest exists when a person
                                        is likely to benefit if the insured continues to live and is likely to
                                        suffer some loss or detriment if the insured dies. Whether the requirement
                                        is met in a given case is a question of fact. Note that the insurable interest
                                        must exist only at the time of contracting and is not required to continue
                                        throughout the life of the policy. For example, if a person purchases a
                                        life insurance policy on the life of his spouse, the policy remains a valid
                                        contract even if the couple later divorces. If a business owner purchases
                                        key-person insurance on a key employee, the owner could choose to continue
                                        the contract if the employee later left the business. Insurable interest
                                        is also not required to continue in the case of a viatical settlement,
                                        a transaction that we discuss in Chapter 12.</p>
                                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-62">In most cases, individual life insurance policies are applied for and
                                        owned by the person who is insured by the policy. Some policies, however,
                                        are issued to persons other than the insured. Insurable interest requirements
                                        vary depending on whether a policy insures the policyowner or someone other
                                        than the policyowner.</p>

                                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-63">The law in all states considers a person to have an insurable interest
                                        in his own life. In other words, a person can always buy insurance on his
                                        own life and generally may name anyone he wishes as beneficiary. Thus,
                                        state laws do not require the beneficiary of such a policy to have an insurable
                                        interest in the proposed insured’s life.</p>

                                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-64">When a person applies for insurance on another person’s life, the applicant
                                        generally must provide the insurer with evidence that she has an insurable
                                        interest in the insured’s life. In most states, the law presumes that an
                                        insurable interest exists between certain close family members. Thus, an
                                        insured’s spouse, mother, father, child, grandparent, grandchild, brother,
                                        and sister are each presumed to have an insurable interest in the life
                                        of the insured. The law deems the bonds of love and loyalty that exist
                                        in such family relationships sufficient to protect the insured. State laws
                                        do not presume an insurable interest in the case of more distant relatives,
                                        such as cousins, aunts and uncles, and stepchildren.</p>

                                    id="loma311-ch10-p-65">Anyone other than a close relative must demonstrate that she has a financial
                                        interest in the continued life of the insured to satisfy the insurable
                                        interest requirements. For example, an individual who is not a close relative
                                        of an insured may be financially dependent on the insured and, thus, would
                                        be harmed if the insured died. Business relationships may also give someone
                                        a financial interest in another’s continued life. The following are some
                                        of the business relationships that create an insurable interest:</p>

                                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-69">Typically, a person who purchases insurance on another person’s life names
                                            himself as the policy beneficiary. Thus, the person who will benefit from
                                            the policy after the insured’s death is also the policyowner, who has an
                                            insurable interest in the insured’s life. When a person purchases insurance
                                            on another person’s life and names a third person as the policy beneficiary,
                                            the possibility arises that policy proceeds may become payable to someone
                                            with no insurable interest in the insured’s life. To prevent such a situation,
                                            statutes in many states require that when a person purchases a policy on
                                            another person’s life, the person named as the policy beneficiary must
                                            have an insurable interest in the insured’s life.</p>

                                            a proposed insured to consent to the issuance of a policy on her life.
                                            Without such consent, a policy taken out on the life of another person
                                            is void. The consent requirement protects insureds from another person
                                            profiting from their deaths without their knowledge. State insurance laws
                                            include exceptions that allow an insurance policy to be issued without

                                            is met before they issue a policy. In addition, many insurers’ underwriting
                                            guidelines impose more stringent insurable interest requirements than the
                                            requirements imposed by state laws. The task of determining insurable interest
                                            is the underwriter’s responsibility. If an insurer fails to exercise reasonable

                                            a given policy, then the insurer could be subject to tort liability for

                                                not become effective until (1) it is delivered to the policyowner and (2)
                                                the initial premium is paid. Both requirements must be met during the continued
                                                good health of the insured in order for the contract to be effective. Generally
                                                the policyowner receives the policy through electronic delivery or accesses
                                                the policy through the insurer’s website. In some cases, the insurer mails
                                                a physical copy of the policy directly to the policyowner.</p>

                                                        paid the initial premium. On September 10, the insurer issued the policy
                                                        as applied for. On September 11, the insurer mailed a physical copy of
                                                        the policy to Ms. Conowitch. Ms. Conowitch died on September 12 before
                                                        the policy arrived in the mail. Courts generally would consider that, because
                                                        the insurer parted with control of the policy and intended to be bound

                                                        Ms. Conowitch at the time of her death. Thus, the policy would be considered
                                                        effective, and the insurer would be liable to pay the policy death benefit.</p>

                                                    policies to include a free look provision. The <em>free look provision</em> gives
                                                    the policyowner a specified period—usually 10 days—following delivery of

                                                    premium paid. The free look period allows the policyowner time to review
