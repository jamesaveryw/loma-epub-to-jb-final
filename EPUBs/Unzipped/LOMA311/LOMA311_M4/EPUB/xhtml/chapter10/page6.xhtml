            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-163">Recall from Chapter 8 that an insurance agent must be licensed by each
                state in which he conducts business and must comply with the state’s insurance
                laws and regulations. Because insurance policies are contracts that are
                binding on the insurer, insurers generally also require that an agent’s
                authority to represent the company be specifically defined in the form
                of a contract.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch10-h3-9">Agency Agreement</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch10-p-164">A financial professional who markets and sells life insurance products
                on behalf of an insurance company acts as an agent of the insurer. Typically,
                insurers enter into a written contract, known as an <span class="gt" data-term="ch10-gt-agencyagreement"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch10-span-50" role="doc-glossref">agency agreement</span> or <em>agency contract</em>,
                with each of their financial professionals. The terms of such an agency
                agreement spell out the rights and duties of the principal (the insurer)
                and the agent. Some agents sell the products of one insurance company exclusively,
                while others have agency agreements with multiple insurers. Some of the
                terms that commonly are included in agency agreements include:</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-171">As the principal in an agency relationship, an insurer has the right to
                determine the scope of the agent’s authority. The agency agreement spells
                out the scope of that authority. Because an agent who acts within the scope
                of his authority has the power to bind his principal, insurers generally
                are interested in limiting the scope of such authority.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch10-p-172">Agents typically have authorization to issue a premium receipt to an applicant
                who completes an application and pays the initial premium. Depending on
                the terms of the receipt, the insurer may be contractually bound to provide
                temporary insurance coverage under the receipt. With the exception of binding
                an insurer to providing temporary coverage under a premium receipt, an
                agent is not generally authorized to enter into binding life insurance
                contracts on an insurer’s behalf. Only specified employees—usually in the
                insurer’s home office—have actual authority to approve an application and
                issue a life insurance policy that is binding on the insurer.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch10-p-173">An application for life insurance generally includes a notice to the applicant
                stating that no policy will become effective unless the application is
                approved and the insurer’s home office issues a policy. By signing the
                application, the applicant acknowledges he is aware that the financial
                professional is not authorized to complete an insurance contract on the
                insurer’s behalf.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-174">Agents typically have actual authority to accept <em>initial</em> premium
                payments on behalf of an insurer. Payment of an initial premium to such
                an agent is legally considered payment to the insurer. Agents, however,
                generally do not have actual authority to accept <em>renewal</em> premium
                payments.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-175">Sometimes an agent acts outside the scope of his authority and the principal
                is bound by the act. In these cases, the principal generally is bound because
                the agent had apparent authority to act on behalf of the principal. For
                example, assume that a financial professional repeatedly accepts renewal
                premium payments from one of his clients and remits the payments to the
                insurer. If the insurer establishes a pattern of accepting the payments
                from the financial professional, then the insurer has in effect agreed
                to the financial professional’s actions. Therefore, the insurer probably
                has conferred apparent authority on the financial professional to accept
                future renewal premium payments from this client. Payment of a renewal
                premium to a financial professional who has apparent authority to accept
                it is payment to the insurer even if the financial professional does not
                promptly remit the payment to the insurer. The scope of an agent’s authority
                is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the situation.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch10-p-176">When a financial professional acts as an agent of an insurer, the knowledge
                that the agent possesses concerning the business he has transacted on behalf
                of the insurer is considered the knowledge of the insurer. We describe
                such situations in detail in Chapter 13.</p>
