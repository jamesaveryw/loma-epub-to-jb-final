            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-18">Most of a life insurance policyowner’s rights in the policy vest when
                the insurer issues the policy. These rights involve elements such as beneficiary
                designations, premium payments, nonforfeiture benefits, policy loans and
                withdrawals, accelerated death benefits, and reinstatements.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-19">One of the most important contractual rights in an individual life insurance
                policy is the policyowner’s right to name the beneficiary who will receive
                the policy proceeds. The beneficiary may be a named individual, the policyowner’s
                estate, a corporation, a charitable organization, or any other entity.
                We describe the naming of a trustee as beneficiary in the next chapter.</p>

                the party who, if living, will receive the life insurance policy proceeds
                after the insured’s death. The policyowner may name more than one primary
                beneficiary and may indicate how the insurer should divide the proceeds
                among the beneficiaries. Following the insured’s death, the insurer will
                pay the policy proceeds in accordance with the policyowner’s wishes as
                stated in the beneficiary designation, assuming that the designation is

                    a second-level contingent beneficiary who is entitled to policy proceeds
                    only if the primary beneficiary and all first-level contingent beneficiaries
                    die before the second-level contingent beneficiary. A second-level contingent
                    beneficiary may also be called a <em>tertiary beneficiary </em>or a<em> final beneficiary</em>.</p>

                class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-27">The fact that a policyholder has designated an individual as a beneficiary
                    does not obligate that individual to accept the proceeds. The named beneficiary
                    may <em>disclaim</em> the proceeds, in which case the proceeds become payable
                    as if the disclaiming beneficiary predeceased the policyholder. A beneficiary
                    may disclaim policy proceeds for several reasons. For example, she may
                    wish to avoid having the proceeds become a part of her taxable estate,
                    prefer to have the payment made to the contingent beneficiary, or wish

                                insurance. Most states permit minors of a stated age to enter into life
                                insurance contracts if specific conditions are met, but many states limit
                                a minor’s right to name the beneficiary by requiring that the beneficiary
                                be the minor herself or one of her close family members, such as a parent
                                or guardian. Therefore, a minor could purchase an insurance policy on the
                                life of the minor’s parent or guardian and name herself as the beneficiary.
                                This limitation is generally meant to ensure that the minor benefits from
                                any life insurance policy he may own, and that the parties involved have
                                clear insurable interest.</p>

                                have an insurable interest in the insured’s life when the contract is formed.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-31">A policyowner may name a group of people as life insurance policy beneficiaries.
                        A beneficiary designation that identifies a certain group of people, rather
                        than naming each person individually, is called a <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-classdesignation"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch11-span-7" role="doc-glossref">class designation</span>.
                        The designations “to my children,” “to my brothers and sisters,” and “to
                        my grandchildren’ are class designations. Class members who survive the
                        insured are entitled to share in the policy proceeds equally. The advantage
                        to the policyowner of making a class designation is that the members of
                        the class who will share in the policy proceeds are not determined until
                        the policyowner dies. People who are born or adopted after the designation
                        is made are automatically included as beneficiaries without the policyowner’s
                        execution of a new beneficiary designation. The disadvantage of a class
                        designation is that, before any proceeds are paid, the insurer must identify
                        and locate all members of the beneficiary class. Locating all of the class
                        members after the insured’s death may be difficult and, thus, could delay
                        payment of the policy proceeds.</p>

                                O’Connell had two daughters. Mr. O’Connell later divorced and remarried
                                Anita Chang. He formally adopted Ms. Chang’s son from a previous marriage,
                                and he and Ms. Chang had a daughter together. If all four children survive

                        proceeds under such a class designation. If Mr. O’Connell had not adopted
                        his stepson, his stepson would not have been entitled to a share of the

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-44">A life insurance policy typically gives the policyowner the contractual
                        right to change a policy’s beneficiary designation whenever he wants, but
                        only during the lifetime of the insured. When a policyowner names a new
                        beneficiary, the prior beneficiary’s right to receive the policy proceeds
                        is revoked. As we saw in Chapter 9, a beneficiary designation is revocable
                        if the policyowner has the unrestricted right to change the designation
                        during the insured’s lifetime; such a beneficiary is known as a <em>revocable beneficiary</em>.</p>
                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-45">A revocable beneficiary’s interest in life insurance policy proceeds vests
                        when the insured dies. Until that time, a revocable beneficiary generally
                        has neither a legal interest in the proceeds nor any involvement with the
                        policy. During the insured’s lifetime,</p>

                                <p id="loma311-ch11-p-47">A revocable beneficiary usually cannot prohibit the policyowner from exercising
                                    any policy ownership rights.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-48">Thus, during the insured’s lifetime, a revocable beneficiary’s interest
                            in the life insurance policy is said to be a <em>mere expectancy</em>. Although
                            a revocable beneficiary expects to receive the policy proceeds following
                            the insured’s death, that expectation may not be met because the policyowner
                            may change the beneficiary designation without obtaining the beneficiary’s
                            consent.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-49">A beneficiary designation generally is considered to be revocable unless
                            the policyowner voluntarily gives up the right to change the beneficiary.
                            A policyowner gives up the right to change the beneficiary when she designates
                            the beneficiary as an irrevocable beneficiary. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch11-gt-irrevocablebeneficiary"
                            epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch11-span-12" role="doc-glossref">irrevocable beneficiary</span> is
                            a beneficiary whose rights to policy proceeds are vested when the beneficiary
                            designation is made. An irrevocable beneficiary’s vested interest in the
                            policy proceeds usually continues as long as the policy remains in force
                            or until the beneficiary (1) consents in writing to a change of beneficiary
                            or (2) predeceases the insured. In many divorce cases, one spouse is required
                            either to purchase a life insurance policy and make the other spouse an
                            irrevocable beneficiary or to name the other spouse as the irrevocable
                            beneficiary of an existing insurance policy. An irrevocable beneficiary
                            designation may also be required if the policyowner assigns ownership of
                            the policy to another party; we discuss assignments in more detail in the
                            next chapter.</p>

                                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-51">Irene Kazadi purchased an insurance policy on her life and named her husband,
                                    Garland, as the irrevocable beneficiary. She named her children as revocable
                                    contingent beneficiaries. After Irene and Garland divorced, Garland would
                                    not consent to Irene’s request to change the beneficiary; thus he remained
                                    the irrevocable beneficiary. Ten years later, Garland died and his vested
                                    interest in the policy was extinguished. Irene then had the right to name
                                    another primary beneficiary as either a revocable or irrevocable beneficiary.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-52">Because an irrevocable beneficiary has a vested interest in the policy
                            proceeds, policies typically limit some of the policyowner’s rights to
                            make changes that affect the policy values unless the irrevocable beneficiary
                            consents in writing. For example, a policyowner typically cannot obtain
                            a policy loan or surrender the policy for cash without the irrevocable
                            beneficiary’s consent.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-53">To make an effective beneficiary change, a policyowner must have legal
                            capacity. In addition, an irrevocable beneficiary must have the legal capacity
                            to consent to a beneficiary change for the change to be effective. A person
                            generally has the required legal capacity if she has attained the age of
                            majority—18 in most states—and is mentally competent. Whether a person
                            is mentally competent is a question of fact that depends on whether the
                            person understood what he was doing at the time. The question of whether
                            a person was mentally competent to make a beneficiary change typically
                            arises when an earlier-named beneficiary claims the policy proceeds and
                            alleges that a later beneficiary designation was ineffective because the
                            policyowner was incompetent at the time. A party to a lawsuit who alleges
                            that a person was not mentally competent to make a beneficiary change or
                            to agree to such a change has the burden of proving that fact.</p>

                        id="loma311-ch11-p-54">A minor does not have the legal capacity to consent to a policyowner’s
                            exercising her rights under a life insurance policy. As a result, if an
                            irrevocable beneficiary has not attained the age of majority, the policyowner
                            cannot obtain the beneficiary’s consent to any policy transaction. Furthermore,
                            a minor’s guardian typically cannot consent on the minor’s behalf. The
                            guardian has a duty to protect the interests of the minor and, thus, usually
                            cannot consent to a transaction that would reduce the minor’s interest
                            in a policy. Therefore, when a policyowner designates a minor as an irrevocable
                            beneficiary, the policyowner is generally unable to interact with the policy
                            in any way that would require the beneficiary’s consent until the beneficiary
                            reaches the age of majority and gives consent.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-55">In most states, the divorce of a married couple does not automatically
                            affect their rights in a life insurance policy. For example, assume that
                            at the time of their divorce, a man owned a policy on his life and the
                            wife was the revocable beneficiary. The fact of the divorce does not affect
                            the husband’s ownership of the policy, and the wife remains the beneficiary
                            until the husband changes the beneficiary designation. In granting a couple
                            a divorce, however, the court may include an order that one party keep
                            a life insurance policy in force and keep the former spouse as the irrevocable
                            beneficiary. Usually a court includes such an order as part of an alimony
                            or child support arrangement, so that the beneficiary or children will
                            continue to be provided for in the event of the insured’s death.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-59">If a policyowner has retained the right to change the beneficiary, the
                                procedure to make such a change is straightforward. To make an effective
                                change of beneficiary, a policyowner must comply with any contractual requirement
                                found in the insurance policy. Most policies issued today specify the
                                <span

                                role="doc-glossref">recording method</span>for a beneficiary change, under which the policyowner
                                    must provide the insurer with a written and signed notification of the
                                    beneficiary change. After the insurer receives the notification, the insurer
                                    updates its policy to reflect the name of the new beneficiary. Some insurers
                                    also require a change of beneficiary request to be signed by disinterested
                                    witnesses. An increasing number of insurers offer policyowners the option
                                    of changing a beneficiary electronically, for instance through email or
                                    by the use of electronic forms hosted on the insurer’s website. In such
                                    cases, an electronic signature is considered sufficient.</p>

                                        the beneficiary from her brother to her daughter. Her policy stated the
                                        recording method for making a beneficiary change. As required by the policy,
                                        Ms. Soun completed a signed notification of the desired beneficiary change
                                        and mailed it to the insurer. The written notification was delayed in the
                                        mail because of bad weather, and Ms. Soun died several days before the
                                        insurer received and processed the beneficiary change. Ms. Soun’s brother
                                        and her daughter both claimed the policy proceeds. Courts in states that
                                        apply the doctrine of substantial compliance are likely to find the beneficiary
                                        change to be effective because Ms. Soun did everything she could to change
                                        the beneficiary before her death. Thus, the policy proceeds would be payable
                                        to Ms. Soun’s daughter.</p>

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-64">A court applies the doctrine of substantial compliance only if it is clear
                                that the policyowner intended to change the beneficiary, and the court
                                considers all of the surrounding circumstances to determine the policyowner’s
                                intent.</p>

                                is effective as long as the method selected clearly indicates the policyowner’s
                                intent to change the beneficiary. In such cases, some states even permit
                                a policyowner to make an effective beneficiary change by means of the policyowner’s
                                will.</p>

                                    might not be met: the people whom he wanted to receive the policy proceeds
                                    may not in fact receive the money. In addition, taxes and other estate
                                    expenses may reduce the amount the decedent’s heirs ultimately receive.
                                    By contrast, life insurance policy proceeds that are paid to a named beneficiary
                                    pass outside a decedent’s will and do not become part of the decedent’s

                                    paid to a named beneficiary rather than to her estate by naming several
                                    levels of contingent beneficiaries.</p>

                                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-88">When an insurer issues a life insurance policy, the insurer makes a contractual
                                    promise to pay a stated death benefit if the insured dies while the policy
                                    is in force. This promise is a conditional promise; the death benefit is
                                    payable only if the policy is in force at the insured’s death. A policyowner
                                    must pay policy premiums as they come due to keep a policy in force.</p>

                                class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-89">Whether a premium was paid when due is a question of fact. The burden
                                    of proof concerning this fact rests on the party who claims that the premium
                                    was paid. For example, assume an insurer denied a claim for policy proceeds
                                    on the grounds that the policy was not in force when the insured died.
                                    The claimant to the policy proceeds sued the insurer claiming that premiums
                                    were paid when due and, thus, the policy was in force at the insured’s
                                    death. The claimant has the burden to prove that premiums were paid when
                                    due, such as by providing records of the relevant bank transactions.</p>

                                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch11-p-90">An applicant for life insurance pays a consideration in exchange for the
                                            insurer’s contractual promise; the initial premium forms part of this consideration.
                                            The insurance contract does not take effect until the essential part of
                                            the consideration is paid. Typically, an applicant pays the initial premium
                                            when she completes the application for insurance. If the parties do not
                                            enter into a life insurance contract, the insurer must refund the premium
                                            to the applicant. Likewise, if a policyowner rejects a life insurance contract
                                            during the contract’s free look period, the insurer must return the initial
                                            premium to the policyowner. Recall from Chapter 10 that the insurance policy
                                            and the coverage it provides are effective during the free look period.</p>

                                                are due. We use the term <em>renewal premiums</em> to refer to all premiums
                                                payable after the initial premium. Although the policyowner must pay a
                                                renewal premium when due to keep a policy in force, the policyowner has
                                                no legal obligation to pay a renewal premium; recall that life insurance
                                                contracts are unilateral contracts. Thus, policyowners have the right to
                                                discontinue premium payments at any time without incurring liability to
                                                the insurer.</p>
                                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-92">As we saw in Chapter 8, state laws require life insurance policies to
                                                include a <em>grace period provision</em>, which allows a policyowner to
                                                pay a renewal premium within a stated time following a premium due date.
                                                For term and whole life policies, the grace period usually is 31 days;
                                                universal life policies usually include a 61-day grace period. Life insurance
                                                coverage continues in force throughout the policy’s grace period, regardless
                                                of whether the premium is ever paid. If the insured dies during the grace
                                                period but before the premium is paid, the insurer is obligated to pay
                                                the policy proceeds. The insurer, however, is entitled to deduct the amount
                                                of the unpaid premium from the policy proceeds before paying those proceeds.</p>

                                            class="txt" id="loma311-ch11-p-93">The grace period begins on the day following a premium due date. For example,
                                                if a premium that is due on April 1 is unpaid on that date, then April
                                                2 is the first day of the policy’s grace period. If the policy provides
                                                a 31-day grace period, then the last day of the grace period is May 2.
                                                The insurer must receive payment no later than midnight of the last day
                                                of the grace period in order for that premium to be considered paid when
                                                due. However, if the last day of the grace period falls on a nonbusiness
                                                day, such as a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, then the premium can
                                                be paid on the next business day. See Figure 11.2 for an illustration of
                                                the grace period.</p>

                                                    payment of a premium by a beneficiary generally does not give the beneficiary
