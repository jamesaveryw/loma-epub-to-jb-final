                        computer. On the right side, an insurance company employee at a desk, also
                        at a computer.</p>
                    <p>Carol Larson applied for a life insurance policy at a standard premium
                        rate. She paid the initial premium of $50 based on that standard rate.</p>
                    <p
                    class="vid-desc">[An arrow appears, labeled “Offer: $50 premium” across the divider of
                        the screen, leading from Carol to the insurer. The word <strong>Offeror</strong> appears
                        under Carol, and the word <strong>Offeree</strong> appears under the insurer.]</p>
                        <p>The insurer, Incarnadine Life Insurance Company, classified Ms. Larson
                            as a substandard risk, issued a policy at a higher-than-standard premium
                            rate, and delivered the policy to Ms. Larson.</p>
                        <p>The new policy offered the same coverage as the policy Ms. Larson applied
                            for, but the monthly premium amount was $25 higher.</p>
                        <p class="vid-desc">[The direction of the arrow flips and the label of the arrow changes to
                            “Counteroffer: $75 premium.”]</p>
                        <p>Because the insurer issued a policy on terms other than those applied
                            for, the insurer has rejected Ms. Larson’s offer and has made a counteroffer.</p>
                        <p

                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>Aaron Hoang completed an application for insurance and paid the initial
                        premium on October 1.</p>
                    <p>His insurability premium receipt provided temporary insurance coverage
                        with a condition precedent.</p>
                    <p>The condition precedent required the insurer to find Mr. Hoang to be an <strong>insurable risk on the date of a required medical examination</strong>.
                        He underwent the examination on October 10, and the physician submitted
                        her report to the insurer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Condition Precedent: Must be an insurable risk on the date of a required medical examination.&#160;</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>After reviewing the application and medical examination, the insurer’s
                        underwriter approved Mr. Hoang as a standard risk on October 17.</p>
                    <p>But before it issued the policy, the insurer learned that Mr. Hoang died
                        in an accident on October 16.</p>
                    <p>Because the insurer found that Mr. Hoang was insurable on the date of
                        his medical examination, the condition was met.</p>
                    <p>The insurance on Mr. Hoang became effective on the date of the medical
                        examination, and the insurer was liable to pay the benefit specified in
                        the premium receipt.</p>
                    <p>But what if Mr. Hoang had died earlier?</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Hoang had died on October 12, before the insurer evaluated his
                        application, the insurer would be required to complete the underwriting
                        process to make a good faith determination as to whether Mr. Hoang was
                        insurable on the day of the medical examination.</p>
                    <p>If the insurer determined that Mr. Hoang was insurable on the date of
                        the medical examination, then it would be liable to pay the benefit specified
                        in the premium receipt.</p>
                    <p>Now assume Mr. Hoang had died even earlier.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Hoang had died on October 8, before the medical examination was
                        completed, the condition precedent would <em>not</em> have been met.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Hoang would not be insured under the temporary insurance agreement.</p>

                    <p>Let’s look at three examples of how beneficiary and payee rights can vary.</p>
                    <p
                    class="vid-desc">[Three people from left to right, Marsha, Jeremy, and Rebecca.]</p>
                        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Marsha owned a policy insuring her life. Marsha
                            named her sister, Rebecca, as the <strong>primary beneficiary</strong>,
                            and her cousin, Jeremy, as the <strong>contingent beneficiary</strong>.</p>
                        <p
                        class="vid-desc">[Rebecca is labeled the “<strong>Primary beneficiary</strong>” and Jeremy
                            is labeled the “<strong>Contingent beneficiary</strong>”.]</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Marsha fades out.]</p>
                            <p>Assume that Rebecca and Jeremy survived Marsha. Rebecca, as the primary
                                beneficiary, was entitled to the policy proceeds. Jeremy’s interest was
                                extinguished.</p>
                            <p>Rebecca elected to receive the proceeds under an optional mode of settlement
                                and thereby became the payee of the settlement agreement. She named her
                                husband, Dae-won, as the contingent payee.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Dae-won appears. He is labeled as <strong>“Contingent Payee,” </strong>and

                            <p>Dae-won, as the contingent payee, will receive any proceeds remaining
                                at Rebecca’s death.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Fade out. Three people again from left to right, Marsha, Jeremy, and
                                Rebecca.]</p>
                            <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Now assume that Marsha elected an optional
                                mode of settlement and named Jeremy as the contingent payee.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Rebecca is labeled the “<strong>Primary beneficiary</strong>” and Jeremy
                                is labeled the “<strong>Contingent beneficiary</strong>”.]</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Marsha fades out.]</p>
                            <p>When Marsha died, the insurer began to pay the policy proceeds to Rebecca
                                in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Rebecca fades out.]</p>
                            <p>If Rebecca dies before all proceeds are paid, then the remaining proceeds
                                will be paid to Jeremy as the contingent payee.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Fade out. Four people from left to right, Marsha, Jeremy, Rebecca, and
                                Dae-won.]</p>
                            <p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Finally, assume that Marsha elected an optional
                                mode of settlement and named Rebecca’s husband, Dae-won, as the contingent
                                payee.</p>

                                labeled <strong>“Contingent payee.”</strong>]</p>
                            <p>In this example, Rebecca died several months before Marsha.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Rebecca fades out.]</p>
                            <p>When Marsha died, the policy proceeds were payable to Jeremy as the contingent
                                beneficiary.</p>
                            <p class="vid-desc">[Marsha fades out. Jeremy’s label changes from “<strong>Contingent beneficiary</strong>”
                                to <strong>“Payee.”</strong>]</p>
                            <p>The insurer pays the policy proceeds to Jeremy in accordance with the
                                terms of the settlement agreement. Any proceeds remaining at Jeremy’s death
                                go to Dae-won, the contingent payee.</p>

                        <p class="vid-desc">[Timeline extends to 2 years, and then 2 years, 1 month.]</p>
                        <p>During the review of the claim ABC discovered a material misrepresentation

                        <p>Assume the incontestability provision in the policy <strong>did not </strong>include

                        <p>Because ABC did not discover the material misrepresentation until after
                            the contestable period had expired, they <em>cannot</em> contest the validity
                            of the policy based on the misrepresentation in the application.</p>
                        <p>This is true even though Mr. Paladin died within the contestable period.</p>
                        <p>Now assume the incontestability provision in the policy <strong>did</strong> include

                        <p>Thus, ABC will always have the option to contest the validity of the policy

                    <p>Because part of the original contestable period still applied when the

                        2 years after the policy’s original date of issue.</p>
                    <p>After the policy was reinstated, the new contestable period gave the insurer
                        the right to contest the policy based on misrepresentations in the <strong> <em>reinstatement application</em> </strong> until

                    <p>After the original contestable period ended, the insurer had the right

                        The insurer’s right to contest the policy ended 2 years after the reinstatement

                    <p>Box 1: Ed Ruff was insured under a life policy issued by New Life Insurance
                        Company. Ed’s wife, Lyn, was the beneficiary.</p>
                    <p>Box 2: Ed disappeared. Lyn filed a claim under Ed’s life insurance policy.</p>
                    <p>Box 3: New Life denied Lyn’s claim because the disappearance could not
                        be attributed to an identifiable cause.</p>
                    <p>Box 4: Lyn hired an attorney and sued New Life.</p>
                    <p>Box 5: New Life’s defense was that they had not found convincing evidence
                        that the insured was dead.</p>
                    <p>Box 6: Lyn, as plaintiff, has the initial burden to prove that the insured
                        died. Lyn’s attorney proves the required elements, creating a rebuttable
                        presumption that the insured is dead.</p>
                    <p>Box 7: To rebut the presumption of death, New Life presents facts to show
                        the insured is not dead.</p>
                    <p>Box 8: At this point, whether the insured is dead is a question of fact
