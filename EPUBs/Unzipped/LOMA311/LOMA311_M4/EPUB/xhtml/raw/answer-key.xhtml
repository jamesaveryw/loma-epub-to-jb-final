                                voidable by the minor. When a minor decides to avoid an insurance contract,
                                she is entitled to a refund of the premiums she paid. As a result, the

                                the contract and pays nothing for it. Most states modified this common
                                law rule by enacting laws that enable minors of a stated minimum age to
                                enter into enforceable life insurance contracts.</p>

                                    continues as long as the policy remains in force, or until the beneficiary
                                    consents in writing to a beneficiary change or predeceases the insured.</li>
                                <li>During an insured’s lifetime, a revocable beneficiary cannot prohibit

                                <li>When a minor is designated as an irrevocable beneficiary, the policyowner
                                    is unable to interact with the policy in any way that would require the

                                    Until that time, a revocable beneficiary generally has neither a legal

                                    policy that contained a typical reinstatement provision. After paying fixed

                                    lapse. There were no outstanding policy loans at the time the policy lapsed.
                                    Ten months later, Ms.&#160;Sage requested to reinstate the lapsed policy.
                                    Consider whether Ms.&#160;Sage must meet the following conditions to reinstate

                    paid any premiums for the policy, he can recover those premiums plus interest.
                    Any policy proceeds remaining after the creditor is paid are payable to
                    the policyowner-insured’s estate.</p>

                            the property for the benefit of the trust beneficiary, Jiansheng. Ownership
                            of trust property is split between the trustee and the trust beneficiary.
                            In this case, Cannon Bank has formal legal title to the property and, thus,

                                as to the identity or existence of the subject matter of the contract.
                                A mutual mistake occurs when both parties to a contract make a mistake,
                                but they make different mistakes.</p>

                                Dean as the policy beneficiary. On September 8, 2012, Ms.&#160;Hewitt mysteriously
                                disappeared and was not heard from again. On September 15, 2019, Mr.&#160;Dean
                                asked a court to declare Ms.&#160;Hewitt dead. The court issued an order
                                on October 3, 2019, declaring Ms.&#160;Hewitt to be dead. The court order
                                did not state the day on which Ms.&#160;Hewitt was presumed to have died.

                    <p class="explanations">When a court declares an insured to be dead but does not specify the date
                        of death for the insured, the insured is presumed to have died on the date
                        of the court order. Therefore, in this situation, Ms.&#160;Hewitt’s presumed
                        date of death is October 3, 2019. The contract owner or other interested
                        party must keep the policy in force until the court issues an order declaring
                        the insured dead. Therefore, premiums must be paid or the policy must be
                        continued under a nonforfeiture option such as the extended term insurance
                        option. If the policy lapses for nonpayment of premiums before the date
                        of the court order, the insurer is not liable to pay the policy proceeds.</p>

                                    the contract is to be determined in accordance with the law of the state
                                    in which the contract is made. As a rule, a contract is made in the state
                                    where the last act necessary to complete the contract occurs. A life insurance
                                    contract typically is considered made in the state in which the policy

                                    the contract contains a choice of laws provision, then the courts typically
