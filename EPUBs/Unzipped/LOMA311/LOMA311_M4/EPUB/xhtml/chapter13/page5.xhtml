            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-75">Sometimes an insurer is prevented from contesting the validity of a life
                insurance policy even after the insurer discovers that a material fact
                was misrepresented. An insurer’s primary barrier to contesting the validity
                of a life insurance policy is the incontestability provision. Other barriers
                to contesting the validity of a policy arise when:</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-76">An agent’s knowledge of a misrepresentation is considered the principal’s
                        knowledge as well.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-80">The rules of contract law give an insurer the right to avoid an otherwise
                enforceable insurance contract if the applicant misrepresented material
                facts in the application for insurance. Laws in most jurisdictions, however,
                limit the time within which an insurer has this right.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch13-p-81">As we have seen, the <em>incontestability provision</em> is a life insurance
                policy provision that denies the insurer the right to avoid the contract
                on the grounds of a material misrepresentation in the application after
                the contract has been in force for a specified period of time. The

                role="doc-glossref">contestable period</span>is the time period within which the insurer has
                    the right to avoid a policy on the grounds of a material misrepresentation
                    in the application. A typical incontestability provision reads as follows:</p>
            <div
            class="example" id="loma311-ch13-div-38">
                <div class="inner" id="loma311-ch13-div-39">
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-82"><strong>Incontestability</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-83">We will not contest the validity of this policy after it has been in force
                        during the lifetime of the insured for two years from the date of issue.</p>
                </div>
                </div>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-84">The above incontestability provision limits the period during which the
                    insurer can avoid the policy to two years from the date of issue. A two-year
                    contestable period is the maximum period allowed by most states. Some insurers
                    include a one-year contestable period in their policies. The states permit
                    this shorter period because it is more favorable to policyowners. The phrase <em>during the lifetime of the insured</em> is
                    an important part of an incontestability provision. The phrase ensures
                    that the policy never becomes incontestable if the person whose life is
                    insured dies during the contestable period. Thus, the insurer will <em>always</em> have
                    the opportunity to investigate for material misrepresentation if the death
                    of the insured occurred within the policy’s contestable period.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch13-p-85">If the phrase <em>during the lifetime of the insured</em> was <em>not</em> included
                    in the incontestability provision and the insured died during the contestable
                    period, a claimant could delay making a death claim until after the contestable
                    period ended. In this case, because the policy’s contestable period no
                    longer applied when the insurer received the death claim, the insurer could
                    not contest the validity of the contract even if it discovered a material
                    misrepresentation. Video 13.2 provides an example of how this phrase affects
                    an insurer’s ability to contest a policy when the insured dies during the
                    contestable period.</p>

                    <h4 id="loma311-ch13-h4-1">Contestable Period Start Date</h4>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-89">Individual life insurance policies often include a date of issue and an
                        effective date. The <em>date of issue</em> is the date the application is
                        approved and the policy is issued by the insurer. The <em>effective date</em> is
                        the date insurance coverage starts. Life insurance policies typically specify
                        that the contestable period starts on the date of issue. Similarly, most
                        states require a two-year contestable period that starts on the date of
                        issue. Sometimes, however, the policy does not specify the date the contestable
                        period starts. When this situation occurs and the date of issue and the
                        effective date are not the same, an ambiguity arises as to which date should
                        be used to determine the start of the contestable period. Under rules of
                        contract construction, ambiguities in a contract are construed against
                        the party that drafted the contract. In this case, a court would interpret
                        the terms of the contract in a manner that is more favorable to the policyowner.
                        Thus, a court would likely choose the date that allows the contestable
                        period to expire as early as possible.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-91">The ABC Insurance Company issued an individual life insurance policy to
                                Victor Wells. The policy’s date of issue was October 20, 2018, but ABC
                                backdated the policy’s effective date to October 1, 2018. The policy did
                                not specify the date on which the contestable period began.</p>

                            id="loma311-ch13-p-92"><strong>Analysis. </strong>Because the policy did not specify the date
                                the contestable period began, an ambiguity arose as to which date should
                                be used to determine the start of the contestable period. Under rules of
                                contract construction, a court would construe the ambiguity against ABC
                                and in favor of Mr. Wells because ABC drafted the contract. The court would
                                likely determine that the contestable period started on October 1, the
                                effective date, because that date allows the contestable period to expire
                                as early as possible.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-93">As we saw in Chapter 11, if a life insurance policy is reinstated, a new
                        contestable period typically starts on the date the policy is reinstated.
                        The length of the new contestable period is the same as the length of the
                        policy’s original contestable period. In other words, if the original contestable
                        period was two years, then the new contestable period would be two years
                        from the reinstatement date. During the new contestable period, the insurer
                        may contest the policy based on misrepresentations in the <em>reinstatement application</em>.
                        In addition, the insurer may contest the policy based on misrepresentations
                        in the <em>original application</em> as long as the <em>original</em> contestable
                        period has not expired. See Video 13.3 for an example of how contestable
                        periods work when a life insurance policy is reinstated.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-96">An insurance agent who helps an applicant complete an application for
                        life insurance is acting as an agent of the insurer. Likewise, a doctor
                        who conducts a medical examination of a proposed insured on behalf of an
                        insurer is acting as the insurer’s agent. Recall that, according to the
                        general rules of agency law, knowledge that an agent gains while acting
                        in his capacity as an agent is considered to be knowledge of the principal.
                        Based on this rule, if an insurance agent or a doctor has knowledge of
                        facts about a proposed insured, then the insurer usually is considered
                        to have that knowledge.</p>
