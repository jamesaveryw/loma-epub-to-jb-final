            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-170">As we saw in Chapter 2, remedies are typically classified as either legal
                or equitable. Common law courts are empowered to grant both types of remedies.</p>

                    are available to the parties to civil lawsuits involving life insurance
                    policies.</p>

                <h3 id="loma311-ch13-h3-12">Legal Remedies</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-174">Most litigation involving life insurance policies begins after an insurer
                    denies a claim for life insurance policy proceeds. A claimant who disagrees
                    with the insurer’s decision may file against the insurer a civil action
                    alleging that by refusing to pay life insurance policy proceeds the insurer
                    breached the contract. If a claimant is successful, a court typically orders
                    the insurer to pay damages, which is the basic legal remedy for most civil
                    wrongs.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-175">Civil damage awards generally provide a plaintiff with compensatory damages.
                    Compensatory damages reimburse an injured party for the monetary losses
                    that resulted from the defendant’s wrongful conduct. In an action for breach
                    of contract, compensatory damages usually are measured as the benefit of
                    the bargain—that is, the amount that restores the plaintiff to the financial
                    position he would have been in if the contract had been performed. For
                    a claimant to life insurance policy proceeds, the benefit of the bargain
                    is the amount of policy proceeds payable by the insurer.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch13-p-176">Punitive damages are awarded in addition to compensatory damages when
                    a defendant’s conduct was malicious or willful. Punitive damages generally
                    are not available in actions based on breach of contract. An exception
                    to this rule is a situation in which an insurer breaches its duty to act
                    in good faith. The duty to act in good faith requires an insurer to deal
                    ethically and fairly with its customers when deciding whether to pay or
                    deny a claim. Many jurisdictions allow plaintiffs to bring bad-faith tort
                    actions against insurers that breach this duty.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-177">No single factor determines whether an insurer has acted in bad faith.
                    The courts most often look for evidence of whether the insurer denied claims
                    unreasonably. In determining whether the insurer’s actions are unreasonable,
                    most courts examine an insurer’s overall conduct and its reasons for denying
                    claims.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-178">Because insurers found to have acted in bad faith may be liable to pay
                    punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages, a plaintiff who proves
                    that an insurer has breached its duty of good faith may recover damages
                    that exceed the amount of the policy’s basic death benefit and supplemental
                    benefits.</p>

                <h3 id="loma311-ch13-h3-13">Equitable Remedies</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-179">The equitable remedies granted to plaintiffs in civil actions involving
                    life insurance policies include rescission, reformation, interpleader,
                    declaratory judgment, and restitution.</p>

                <h4 id="loma311-ch13-h4-5">Rescission</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-180">The remedy of rescission is of special importance to insurers. Rescission
                    allows a contract to be cancelled and the parties returned to the positions
                    they would have been in if no contract had been created. When a contract
                    is rescinded, the contract is void. Contracts may be rescinded in a number
                    of ways, such as the following:</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-184">The parties to a contract can mutually agree to rescind the contract if
                    they have contractual capacity. In this case, they can agree to rescind
                    the contract and they need not apply to the courts to do so.</p>

                    rescinded when that party exercises her right to rescind the contract.
                    When a party has a legal right to avoid—that is, rescind—a contract without
                    incurring legal liability, that party can exercise that right without having
                    to resort to the courts. A party who has the right to avoid a contract
                    can do so by (1) notifying the other party of the decision to rescind the
                    contract and (2) returning to the other party the consideration given for
                    the contract.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-188">In some cases, a contract may be rescinded by a court order.</p>

                            protect its right to contest the policy, the insurer must ask the court
                            to rescind the contract while the policy remains contestable.</p>

                    policy, the insurer must return to the policyowner the total amount of
                    premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals on the policy.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-192">Reformation is an equitable remedy in which a written contract is rewritten
                        to express the original agreement of the contracting parties. Reformation
                        is available when parties reach an agreement and put it in writing, but
                        the written document does not adequately reflect the parties’ intent. If
                        the parties cannot mutually agree to correct such a mistake, one party
                        may ask the court to correct the mistake in the written contract.</p>
                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-193">A plaintiff who seeks reformation of a contract must present the court

                        a degree of proof in which evidence shows that the truth of the facts asserted
                        is highly probable and leaves no reasonable doubt as to the truth of those
                        facts. Clear and convincing evidence is a higher degree of proof than a
                        preponderance of the evidence, which is the degree of proof generally required
                        in civil court actions. As we saw in Chapter 2, <em>preponderance of the evidence</em> means
                        that the decision as to an issue of fact must be supported by the greater
                        weight of the evidence.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-198">Another equitable remedy available to insurers is <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-interpleader"
                            epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch13-span-61" role="doc-glossref">interpleader</span>,
                            which is a court proceeding under which an insurer that cannot determine
                            the proper recipient of policy proceeds pays the proceeds to a court and
                            asks the court to decide the proper recipient. A party who seeks the remedy
                            of interpleader must be a disinterested stakeholder. In other words, the
                            party cannot have a personal claim to the money or property in question.
                            When an insurer files a life insurance interpleader, the court, not the
                            insurer, determines who is entitled to the proceeds. After paying the money
                            into the court, the insurer usually is released from any further liability
                            under the policy.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-199">Interpleader is an important remedy for an insurer that is uncertain about
                            who should receive policy proceeds. Because of beneficiary changes, assignments,
                            and other policy transactions, insurers sometimes must decide between conflicting
                            claimants to policy proceeds. If the insurer pays policy proceeds to a
                            claimant who is not entitled to the proceeds, the proper claimant can later
                            assert a claim to the proceeds. In this case, the insurer may be obligated
                            to pay the proceeds again. Interpleader prevents this possibility because
                            after the insurer pays the policy proceeds into court, the conflicting
                            claimants are prevented from pursuing other legal action against the insurer
                            to recover the proceeds.</p>

                        <h4 id="loma311-ch13-h4-8">Declaratory Judgment</h4>
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-200">In common law jurisdictions, courts have the power to make determinations
                            as to legal rights when no one has been injured. A <em>declaratory judgment</em>,
                            as we saw in Chapter 2, is a judicial statement that declares or denies
                            the parties’ legal rights but does not include specific relief or any means
                            to enforce those rights. A declaratory judgment is available at the discretion
                            of the court and typically is not granted if any other appropriate remedy
                            is available. Insurers might seek this type of remedy to resolve issues
                            involving interpretation of policy provisions or insurance laws. For instance,
                            if an insurer has a question about the legality of a new insurance law,
                            the insurer might ask a court to issue a declaratory judgment interpreting
                            the law. Another example is that competing beneficiaries may file an action
                            for a declaratory judgment to establish the proper beneficiary of a life
                            insurance policy.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-201"><em>Restitution</em>, as we saw in Chapter 2, is a remedy under which
                            a party is ordered to return property to its owner or to the person entitled
                            to it. Restitution sometimes is granted as a legal remedy and other times
                            as an equitable remedy. For life insurance policies, restitution is a remedy
                            that might be sought when an insurer overpays policy proceeds or pays proceeds
                            to the wrong claimant. For example, assume that an insurer pays policy
                            proceeds to the wrong claimant. Later, the proper claimant asserts his
                            claim to the proceeds, and the insurer discovers that it paid the wrong
                            claimant. The insurer can then seek restitution from the claimant who was
                            not entitled to the proceeds. In such a situation, a court likely would
                            order the claimant who was not entitled to the proceeds to repay the insurer
                            the amount of policy proceeds paid in error.</p>
