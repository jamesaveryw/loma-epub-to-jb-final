            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-29">Because a life insurance policy is a unilateral contract, the policyowner
                does not promise to pay premiums and cannot be compelled by law to do so.
                The insurer, on the other hand, is legally bound by its contractual promises
                for as long as premiums are paid. In some situations, however, an insurer
                contests the validity of an insurance policy. Typically, an insurer contests
                a policy for one of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch13-ul-7">
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-30">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-30">A material misrepresentation</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-31">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-31">A defect in the formation of the contract</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-32">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-32">A mistake</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-33">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-33">The beneficiary wrongfully killed the insured</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-34">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch13-gt-policycontest" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma311-ch13-span-6" role="doc-glossref">policy contest</span> is a
                court action to determine the validity of a life insurance policy. According
                to the rules of general contract law, when parties fail to enter into a
                valid contract, all parties must be returned as much as possible to the
                positions that they occupied before they attempted to enter into the contract.
                Therefore, when an insurer is successful in contesting the validity of
                an individual life insurance policy, the insurer generally must return
                to the policyowner all premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals.
                An insurer can contest a policy</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch13-ul-8">
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-34">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-35"><strong>During the insured’s lifetime.</strong> When an insurer learns
                        that it has grounds to contest a life insurance policy <em>during the insured’s lifetime</em>,
                        it notifies the policyowner that it has elected to rescind the policy.
                        The insurer returns all premiums that have been paid plus any interest
                        minus any withdrawals. If the policyowner does not accept the premium refund,
                        the insurer initiates an action in court for rescission of the contract.
                        We discuss rescission in more detail later in the chapter.</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-36"><strong>After the death of the insured.</strong> When an insurer learns
                        that it has grounds to avoid a life insurance policy <em>after the death of the insured</em>,
                        it denies payment of policy proceeds and returns to the policyowner or
                        the policyowner’s estate all premiums paid plus any interest minus any
                        withdrawals. A claimant to life insurance policy proceeds who decides to
                        challenge an insurer’s action may file an action in court to enforce the
                        contract. The insurer’s defense to the claimant’s action is that the contract
                        was invalid.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-37">Note, however, that once a contract ends, the parties may no longer contest
                the validity of that contract. For example, after policy proceeds have
                been paid, the policy ends and the insurer can no longer contest it.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-38">Not every court action involving a life insurance policy is a policy contest.
                Sometimes, an insurer denies a claim or takes an action for a reason other
                than a challenge of a contract’s validity. For instance, an insurer may
                deny a claim because the insured died as a result of a cause that the policy
                excludes from coverage. When an insurer denies a claim based on a provision
                in the life insurance policy, the insurer is performing the contract according
                to the terms of the policy. Because such an action acknowledges the validity
                of the contract, it is not a policy contest. We discuss performance of
                contracts in more detail in Chapter 14. The following exercise illustrates
                the difference between performing and contesting a life insurance policy.&#160;</p>
