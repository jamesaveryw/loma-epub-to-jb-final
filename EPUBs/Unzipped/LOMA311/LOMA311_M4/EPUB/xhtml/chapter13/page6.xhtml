            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-134">In the previous section, we saw how an insurer’s right to contest the
                validity of a life insurance policy on the grounds of material misrepresentation
                may be limited. As this section shows, an insurer has the right to contest
                the validity of a policy on grounds other than material misrepresentation
                and can do so at any time while the policy is in force. However, once a
                contract ends, the parties may no longer contest the validity of that contract.</p>

                <h3 id="loma311-ch13-h3-9">Defect in the Formation of the Contract</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-135">Recall that the formation of a valid informal contract, such as a life
                    insurance policy, involves four requirements: mutual assent, adequate consideration,
                    contractual capacity, and lawful purpose. If any one of these requirements
                    is missing, the parties never entered into a valid contract. A party has
                    the right to contest a contract’s validity at any time if any requirement
                    was not met.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-136">As we have seen, state insurance laws impose an insurable interest requirement
                    on individual life insurance policies. This requirement guards against
                    policies being purchased as wagering contracts. Requiring the policyowner
                    to have had an insurable interest when the policy was issued ensures that
                    the lawful purpose requirement for forming a contract is met. If no insurable
                    interest existed at the time of contracting, the contract is void. The
                    incontestability provision, therefore, does not prohibit contesting a policy
                    based on lack of an insurable interest. The insurer may contest a contract’s
                    validity based on lack of an insurable interest at any time while the policy
                    is in force.</p>
                <div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch13-div-97">&#160;</div>
                <h3 id="loma311-ch13-h3-10">Mistake</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-137">A contract is sometimes void or voidable because one or both parties made
                    a mistake when entering the contract. Only certain types of mistakes, however,
                    affect the validity of a contract. For instance, if one party to a contract
                    makes an error in judgment and later realizes that he made a bad bargain,
                    he must honor the contract. The courts will not remedy a bad bargain. The
                    types of mistakes that make a contract void or voidable are mistakes that
                    prevent the parties from mutually assenting to the terms of the agreement.
                    Without this mutual assent, no contract is formed.</p>

                            applicant and the insurer were aware that the policy, if issued, would
                            have a free look provision as required by law. This provision would give
                            the applicant a certain period of time after the policy was issued to return
                            the policy to the insurer for a full refund of the initial premium. The
                            applicant believed that the law in his state required a 30-day free look
                            provision. In fact, the law required a 10-day free look provision.</p>

                        a unilateral mistake of fact depends on the type of mistake and the circumstances.
                        For example, assume that the offeror mistakenly misstates the price of
                        the contract. If the offeree reasonably relied on the price as it was stated
                        and entered into a contract, the contract is valid and binding. In contrast,
                        if a reasonable person in the position of the offeree would have known
                        that the offeror made a mistake in stating the price, then the contract
                        generally is voidable by the offeror. In such a case, the party who made
                        the unilateral mistake may avoid the contract after discovering the mistake.</p>

                                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-156">When a person purchases a life insurance policy with the intention of
                                    killing the insured to collect policy proceeds, the insurer is not liable
                                    to pay the policy proceeds and is responsible only for returning to the
                                    policyowner the premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals.
                                    In this situation, the incontestability provision does not prohibit a contest
                                    of the policy, and the insurer can contest the contract’s validity at any
                                    time.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-157">If, on the other hand, the policy was not purchased with the intention
                                    of killing the insured, but a beneficiary later is convicted in a civil
                                    or criminal court of wrongfully killing the insured, the contract is valid.
                                    The beneficiary, however, is disqualified from receiving policy proceeds.
                                    In this situation, the insurer must pay the policy proceeds to someone—usually
                                    another beneficiary. If no other beneficiary exists, the insurer usually
                                    pays the proceeds to the policyowner or the policyowner’s estate. We discuss
                                    disqualification of a beneficiary in more detail in Chapter 14.</p>
