            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch13-h2-5">Elements of a Material Misrepresentation</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-39">Material misrepresentation is the most common reason that an insurer may
                rescind a life insurance policy and deny payment of policy proceeds. As
                a general rule, if one party makes a material misrepresentation, then the
                contract is voidable by the innocent party. A material misrepresentation
                induces a party to enter into a contract that it would not have entered
                into had it known the truth. Thus, when an applicant makes a misrepresentation
                that induces an insurer to enter into a life insurance policy that the
                insurer would not have entered into had it known the truth, the policy
                is voidable by the insurer. In this situation, the insurer has the option
                of avoiding the contract.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-40">Each jurisdiction has its own requirements that insurers must meet to
                successfully challenge the validity of a life insurance policy based on
                a misrepresentation in the application for insurance. Most jurisdictions
                require that an insurer prove these three elements:</p>
            <ul class="list"
            id="loma311-ch13-ul-9">
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-36">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-41">The applicant or proposed insured misrepresented or failed to disclose
                        a fact.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-37">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-42">The fact was known by the applicant or proposed insured at the time of
                        the misrepresentation or failure to disclose.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch13-li-38">
                    <p id="loma311-ch13-p-43">The fact was material—or relevant—to the insurer’s acceptance of the risk.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-44">Usually, when the validity of a contract is contested in court, the party
                who seeks to avoid the contract bears the burden of proof. Thus, when an
                insurer seeks to avoid a life insurance policy on the grounds of material
                misrepresentation, the insurer has the burden of proving the three elements
                shown above. How an insurer meets its burden of proving a material misrepresentation
                varies depending on the facts of each case.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch13-h3-1">Duty to Disclose</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-45">When an insurer underwrites an individual life insurance policy, it decides
                if the proposed insured is an insurable risk and, if so, what premium rate
                to charge for the coverage. Information needed to make these decisions
                comes from the applicant for insurance or the proposed insured. An insurer,
                therefore, must be able to rely on the truth of the statements in the application.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-46">The <em>duty to disclose</em> requires applicants and proposed insureds
                to disclose to the insurer any fact that is within their knowledge and
                that is material to the insurance. Thus, the applicant and the proposed
                insured must provide truthful and complete information in the application
                for insurance, in a medical examination, and in written statements or answers
                furnished to the insurer as evidence of insurability. Note that this duty
                to disclose is breached if an applicant or proposed insured (1) provides
                false information or (2) conceals a material fact.</p>
                <div class="example" id="loma311-ch13-div-6">

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-48">In an application for life insurance, the applicant was asked to list
                            every doctor’s visit in the last five years and explain the reason and
                            result for each visit. The applicant noted that she had visited her family
                            doctor four times: three times for routine physical examinations and once
                            because she was feeling tired. In fact, the applicant had three routine
                            physical examinations, but after her fourth visit, the doctor referred
                            her to a specialist who informed her that she had end stage kidney failure.</p>
                        <p
                        class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-49"><strong>Analysis. </strong>The applicant failed to meet her duty to disclose
                            because she did not disclose on the application for insurance the result
                            of the fourth doctor’s visit. She concealed the fact that a specialist
                            diagnosed her with end stage kidney failure. In this case, the concealment
                            provides grounds for the insurer to contest the life insurance policy.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-50">In providing an insurer with evidence of insurability, an applicant or
                    a proposed insured is required to disclose only those facts that are known
                    by the applicant or proposed insured at the time of the disclosure. A person
                    is not required to speculate on the proposed insured’s health status.</p>

                            doctor, however, did not discuss the results with Mr. Guzman, who later
                            completed an application for life insurance. In the application, Mr. Guzman
                            disclosed that he had experienced periods of fatigue and undergone medical

                    <h3 id="loma311-ch13-h3-3">Material to the Insurance</h3>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch13-p-54">According to the rules of contract law, statements made by parties when
                        they enter into a contract can be classified as either warranties or representations.</p>
                    <ul
                    class="list" id="loma311-ch13-ul-10">

                            <p id="loma311-ch13-p-55">A <em>warranty</em>, as we have seen, is a promise or guarantee recognized
                                by law that a statement of fact is true. A warranty that is not <em>literally</em> true
                                gives an injured party grounds to avoid the contract. In the past, the
                                doctrine of warranties sometimes resulted in unjust results when applied
                                to life insurance. For example, assume that an applicant for life insurance
                                said that she had visited a doctor for treatment of a toe on her <em>left</em> foot
                                when in fact the visit was for treatment of a toe on her <em>right</em> foot.
                                Under the doctrine of warranties, the insurer had grounds to rescind the
                                contract even though the error was not material to the insurance and thus
                                would not have affected the insurer’s decision to issue the policy. Laws
                                throughout the United States now specify that, in the absence of fraud,
                                statements made in life insurance applications are representations and
                                not warranties.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch13-li-40">
                            <p id="loma311-ch13-p-56">A <em>representation</em> is a statement made by a contracting party that
                                is influential in inducing the other party to enter into the contract.
                                A representation can be used to invalidate the contract if the statement
                                is not <em>substantially</em> true and the statement induced the other party
                                to enter into the contract. In other words, if a party misrepresents a
                                fact that is material to the insurance, the contract is voidable by the
                                other party. A misrepresentation is considered to be material to the insurance
                                when the insurer—if it had known the truth—would have evaluated the proposed
                                risk differently. Generally, a misrepresentation is material if the insurer
                                with knowledge of the true facts would have taken any of the following
                                actions with regard to the policy: (1) declined to issue, (2) increased
                                the premium rate, or (3) excluded coverage for certain risks.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-57">The question of whether a misrepresented or concealed fact was material
                            to the insurance is a question of fact that must be answered from the point
                            of view of the insurer. The answer does <em>not</em> depend on what a reasonable
                            person in the applicant’s position would have considered to be material
                            to the insurance.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-58">In a few states, an insurer can avoid a life insurance policy on the grounds
                            of material misrepresentation <em>only </em>if the cause of the insured’s
                            death was directly related to the misrepresentation. In most states, however,
                            an insurer can avoid a life insurance policy on the grounds of material
                            misrepresentation even if the cause of the insured’s death was not related
                            to the fact that was misrepresented.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-59">When a proposed insured makes a misrepresentation regarding <em>medical history</em> on
                            the application for life insurance, an insurer may seek to avoid the contract
                            on the grounds of a material misrepresentation. However, when a proposed
                            insured makes a misrepresentation regarding <em>age or sex</em> on the application
                            for life insurance, the actions an insurer may take usually are determined
                            by the provisions of the life insurance policy. In most jurisdictions,
                            a misrepresentation regarding an insured’s age or sex affects the premium
                            rate that an insurer charges for life insurance. Thus, a misstatement of
                            the insured’s age or sex is a significant issue.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch13-p-60">In the United States and many other countries, life insurance policies
                            typically include a <em>misstatement of age or sex provision</em> that describes
                            the action an insurer will take in the event that the age or sex of the
                            insured is incorrectly stated. Note that when an insurer takes action because
                            of a misstatement of age or sex, the insurer is enforcing the policy’s
                            misstatement of age or sex provision. Such an action by the insurer is <em>not</em> considered
                            a contest to the validity of the contract and is not prohibited by the
                            incontestability provision, which we discuss in the next section. As Video
                            13.1 illustrates, when a proposed insured makes a misrepresentation regarding
                            age or sex on an application for life insurance, the insurer’s action—as
                            specified in the policy—depends on when the misstatement is discovered.</p>
