            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-17">An annuity contract is performed when the insurer pays out annuity payments
                in accordance with the terms of the contract. From an insurer’s perspective,
                performance of an annuity contract is generally not a complicated task.
                The insurer simply follows the contract owner’s instructions as to who
                receives the benefits. In most cases, the contract owner and the payee
                are the same person. Contract owners also select when and how payees will
                receive annuity payments. Typically, computerized systems track contract
                values as well as the timing and amounts of annuity payments, and most
                of the time insurers use standard procedures to administer annuity claims.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-18">One of an insurer’s most important responsibilities regarding performance
                    of an annuity contract is to ensure that annuity payments are disbursed
                    according to the payout option. Annuity contracts contain several different <em>payout options</em>,
                    also called <em>settlement options</em>, from which the contract owner may
                    select. When choosing payout options, contract owners usually consider
                    factors such as how long they want periodic annuity payments to be made
                    and the income tax advantages associated with various options.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch14-p-19">Many contract owners select <em>annuitized</em> payout options, which tie
                    annuity payments to the life expectancy of a named person, known as an <em>annuitant</em>.
                    The most common annuitized payout options are:</p>

                            amount may change upon the death of an annuitant other than the last surviving

                            the insurer makes payments to a beneficiary for the remainder of the period

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-24">Sometimes annuities are purchased as a result of a <span class="gt" data-term="ch14-gt-structuredsettlement"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch14-span-6" role="doc-glossref">structured settlement</span>,
                    which is a settlement of a civil dispute or lawsuit in which a party agrees
                    to make periodic payments to a specified payee for a specified period of
                    time. Structured settlements usually result from out-of-court negotiations
                    between a plaintiff and a defendant and their respective attorneys. These
                    settlement agreements are entered into most often by parties involved in
                    personal injury lawsuits.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-25">After the parties agree on the terms, the settlement agreement is incorporated
                    into the trial court’s judgment. Only the person specified in the structured
                    settlement agreement as the payee can be named as a payee on periodic payment
                    checks, and periodic payments cannot be accelerated or increased. Because
                    the terms of the settlement agreement are put into a court order, that
                    order must be followed. Any changes must be approved by the court. In the
                    United States, periodic payments received by a payee from a structured
                    settlement usually are not subject to federal income tax.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch14-p-26">Each structured settlement agreement is designed to meet the unique needs
                    of the plaintiff. The payee who receives payments under a structured settlement
                    can be the plaintiff or another person. Thus, a structured settlement can
                    require a defendant to make payments to someone other than the person who
                    was directly harmed by the defendant’s actions.</p>

                            structured settlement that required the defendant to make periodic payments
                            to an education fund for the plaintiff’s minor children until those children
                            reach the age of 18.</p>

                <h4 id="loma311-ch14-h4-1">Annuity Contracts and Structured Settlements</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-29">Annuity contracts used to fund structured settlements usually are owned
                    by the defendant or the defendant’s property/casualty insurer. When the
                    structured settlement agreement permits, the defendant or the defendant’s
                    property/casualty insurer can assign payment obligations to a <em>third-party assignment company</em>,
                    often referred to as a <em>factoring company</em>. In such a situation,
                    the assignment company becomes the owner of the annuity. A third-party
                    assignment company typically purchases an annuity contract from an affiliated
                    life insurance company to fund the periodic payments. Assigning payment
                    obligations to a third-party assignment company can be advantageous to
                    all parties because these companies typically have extensive experience
                    in the administration of structured settlements.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-30">Regardless of who owns the annuity contract, structured settlement agreements
                    typically require the contract owner to irrevocably assign the periodic
                    payments from the annuity contract to the payee specified in the structured
                    settlement agreement. Therefore, the annuity contract owner cannot change
                    the identity of the payee who is entitled to receive periodic payments.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-31">Because the payee does not own the annuity contract, he cannot sell the
                    contract to another party. However, the payee may assign the periodic payments
                    he receives from a structured settlement to another party. For example,
                    a payee may prefer a discounted lump-sum amount to an income stream, and
                    assign the rights to the periodic payments to a company in exchange for
                    a discounted lump sum. A payee who wishes to assign the periodic payments
                    from a structured settlement agreement to another party must obtain a court
                    order approving the transaction.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-32">Contract owners who purchase annuities to fund structured settlements
                        do not have the same freedom to select payout options as do other annuity
                        contract purchasers. The terms of the structured settlement agreement determine
                        the payout options available to these contract owners. The insurer that
                        issues the annuity contract is responsible for administering the payments
                        according to the terms of the structured settlement agreement. Typically,
                        this responsibility involves ensuring that the specified payee receives
                        periodic payments when they are due.</p>
