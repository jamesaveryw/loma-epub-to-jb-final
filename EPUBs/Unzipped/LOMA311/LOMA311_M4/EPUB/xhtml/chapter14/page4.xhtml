            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch14-h2-5">Performance of the Life Insurance Contract</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-39">As we saw in Chapter 4, a life insurance contract is a unilateral contract
                under which the insurer promises to pay the policy proceeds to the named
                beneficiary following the insured’s death. The insurer performs its contractual
                promise when it pays the policy proceeds.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-40">In performing its contractual obligations, an insurer carefully evaluates
                each claim to ensure that it pays the policy proceeds to the correct person
                according to the terms of the life insurance contract. In certain situations,
                an insurer may deny a claim and refuse to pay policy proceeds if the terms
                of the contract require such an action. In all cases, insurers review all
                relevant information before approving or denying a claim.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-41">Insurers establish standard claim procedures that employees follow when
                processing life insurance claims. These procedures are designed to verify
                the validity of all claims. Standard claim procedures for most insurers
                include the following tasks:</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch14-ul-6">

            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-47">Although insurers take steps to avoid paying claims that are not valid,
                an insurer cannot unduly delay payment of a claim. As we saw in Chapter
                8, laws based on the NAIC Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act require
                insurers to establish reasonable standards for the prompt investigation
                and settlement of claims. Similarly, most jurisdictions around the world
                require prompt payment of valid claims, often within a specified number
                of days of receiving valid proof of loss.</p>
            <div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch14-div-17">&#160;</div>
            <h4 id="loma311-ch14-h4-2">Proof of Loss</h4>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-48">A person who files a claim for life insurance policy proceeds must give
                the insurer proof of that claim—called <em>proof of death</em> or <em>proof of loss</em>—by
                providing evidence that the insured person has died. Acceptable evidence
                of an insured’s death varies among jurisdictions.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-49">In the United States, most insurers require claimants to submit a <em>certified death certificate</em>,
                also called an <em>official death certificate</em>, as proof that the insured
                has died. Some insurers also accept an Attending Physician’s Statement.
                Insurers in other countries may require claimants to submit more extensive
                information, or they may accept other forms of documentation as proof of
                a claim.</p>
            <div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch14-div-18">&#160;</div>
            <h4 id="loma311-ch14-h4-3">Proper Payee</h4>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-50">After determining that a claim is valid, the insurer must identify the
                proper payee of policy proceeds, or the insurer risks being subjected to
                multiple claims. If the insurer pays policy proceeds to a payee who is
                not entitled to them, the proper payee can later assert a valid claim to
                the proceeds, and the insurer will be obligated to pay the claim again.
                In this case, the insurer can seek to recover from the wrong payee the
                amount paid in error. However, pursuing repayment can be difficult and
                costly for an insurer.</p>
            <div class="example" id="loma311-ch14-div-19">
                <p class="example-header" id="loma311-ch14-p-51">EXAMPLE</p>
                <div class="inner" id="loma311-ch14-div-20">
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-52">The ABC Insurance Company paid Cindy Albert the $100,000 proceeds of a
                        life insurance policy, Three months later, ABC received a claim for those
                        proceeds from Stanley Albert. If ABC determines that Stanley Albert is
                        in fact the proper payee, ABC will be liable to pay him the $100,000. Then
                        ABC will have a cause of action against Cindy Albert to recover the $100,000
                        it mistakenly paid her.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-53">For most claims, the identity of the proper payee is clear, and the insurer
                is able to pay policy proceeds to a named beneficiary. Some claims, however,
                require an insurer to conduct an investigation to determine the proper
                payee of policy proceeds. In the following sections, we describe three
                situations that require further investigation by the insurer: conflicting
                claimants, common disasters, and short-term survivorship.</p>
            <p class="txt-ni"
            id="loma311-ch14-p-54"><strong>Conflicting Claimants</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-55">Sometimes, two or more claimants assert a right to life insurance policy
                proceeds. For example, both a beneficiary and an assignee might assert
                a claim to the policy proceeds. Insurers usually settle these types of
                claims by encouraging the claimants to agree on how the proceeds should
                be divided. For some claims, however, claimants are unable to agree.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-56">As we saw in Chapter 13, <em>interpleader</em> is a court proceeding under
                which an insurer that cannot determine the proper recipient of policy proceeds
                pays the proceeds to a court and asks the court to decide the proper recipient.
                The court, not the insurer, determines who is entitled to the proceeds.
                After paying the money into the court, the insurer usually is released
                from any further liability under the insurance contract.</p>
                <p class="txt-ni"
                id="loma311-ch14-p-57"><strong>Common Disasters</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-58">Sometimes an insured and the primary beneficiary die as a result of a
                    common disaster, such as an automobile accident or a plane crash. In such
                    cases, the insurer must determine whether the beneficiary survived the
                    insured. A primary beneficiary is entitled to receive policy proceeds only
                    if she survived the insured.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-59">In the United States, when the insurer cannot determine whether the insured
                    or the primary beneficiary died first, most states have a simultaneous
                    death act that provides a reasonable solution. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch14-gt-simultaneousdeathact"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch14-span-11" role="doc-glossref">simultaneous death act</span> states
                    that if the insured and beneficiary die at the same time or under circumstances
                    that make it impossible to determine which of them died first, then the
                    insured is deemed to have survived the beneficiary. Unless the policy states
                    otherwise, policy proceeds are payable as though the insured outlived the
                    beneficiary.</p>

                            lived had a simultaneous death act. The Dares died in a plane crash, but
                            evidence did not show who died first. Therefore, the state’s simultaneous
                            death act determines how policy proceeds are paid.</p>

                            of a life insurance policy that named Mrs. Dare as the primary beneficiary
                            and their daughter, Edna, as the contingent beneficiary. Mr. Dare, the
                            insured, is deemed to have survived the primary beneficiary, Mrs. Dare.
                            The policy proceeds are payable to Edna, the contingent beneficiary of
                            the policy.</p>

                            Her policy did not name a contingent beneficiary and did not include a
                            survivorship clause. Mrs. Dare, the insured, is deemed to have survived
                            the primary beneficiary, Mr. Dare. Because Mrs. Dare’s policy did not name
                            a contingent beneficiary, the policy proceeds are payable to her estate.</p>

                </p>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-65">Simultaneous death acts govern situations in which an insurer cannot determine
                    if the primary beneficiary outlived the insured. However, sometimes a beneficiary
                    survives the insured for a short period of time, called <em>short-term survivorship</em>,
                    and the right to receive the life insurance policy proceeds vests in the
                    beneficiary at the insured’s death. If the beneficiary dies before receiving
                    the policy proceeds, then the insurer must pay the proceeds to the beneficiary’s
                    estate. This situation can cause policy proceeds to be paid in a manner
                    contrary to what the policyowner intended.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-66">To prevent such a result, life insurance policies may contain a survivorship
                    clause, as we saw in Chapter 11. This clause requires the beneficiary to
                    survive the insured by a stated period of time, usually 30 or 60 days,
                    to be entitled to receive the policy proceeds. If the beneficiary does
                    not survive for the stated period of time, the insurer pays the proceeds
                    as if the insured outlived the beneficiary. When a policy includes a survivorship
                    clause, the insurer must delay paying a death claim until the required
                    survivorship period has expired (or the beneficiary dies, if earlier).
                    Thus, for example, if a policy requires the beneficiary to survive the
                    insured by at least 30 days, then the insurer must wait until the earlier
                    of the end of the specified 30-day period or the death of the beneficiary
                    before paying the policy proceeds. Video 14.1 shows the effect of a survivorship
                    clause.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-103">Usually, the insurer’s employees follow standard claim procedures to establish
                    a claim’s validity and to make sure the insurer pays the proper amount
                    to the right person. Sometimes, however, an insurer must conduct an extensive
                    investigation to determine the validity of a claim. When handling these
                    special claim situations, insurers need to determine critical factors,
                    such as whether to pay the claim, who should receive policy proceeds, and
                    the amount of proceeds to be paid. In the following sections, we discuss
                    some of the situations in which insurers closely examine claims before
                    paying policy proceeds.</p>

                <h4 id="loma311-ch14-h4-5">Detecting Fraud</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-104">Insurers train their staff to spot signs of potentially fraudulent claims.
                    An unusual claim does not indicate fraud. However, such a claim may warrant
                    more investigation before the claim can be approved. As we saw in Chapter
                    8, almost all states have regulations governing the handling and reporting
                    of insurance fraud, and some states require insurers to develop a fraud
                    plan to more effectively recognize fraudulent claims.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch14-p-105">Most life insurance policies contain exclusions. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch14-gt-exclusion"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch14-span-31" role="doc-glossref">exclusion</span> is
                    a provision that specifies certain situations under which the insurer will
                    not pay the policy’s face amount. If the cause of an insured’s death was
                    excluded from coverage, then the insurer has no contractual liability to
                    pay the full policy death benefit. Policies typically state that the insurer’s
                    liability is limited to the amount of premiums paid for the policy. Sometimes
                    a policy provides that the insurer will be liable only for the policy’s
                    cash surrender value.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-106">In the past, during periods of war, insurers sometimes included a war
                    exclusion in life insurance policies. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch14-gt-warexclusionprovision"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch14-span-32" role="doc-glossref">war exclusion provision</span> states
                    that an insurer will not pay the full policy proceeds if an insured’s death
                    is caused by war-related activities. U.S. insurers, however, rarely add
                    war exclusions to modern-day life insurance policies, and insurers often
                    do not enforce such clauses found in older policies.</p>

                    states that an insurer will not pay the policy face amount if the insured’s
                    death is caused by certain aviation-related activities. Insurers usually
                    add these exclusions to policies that insure people involved in military
                    or experimental aviation activities and to those employed by airlines as
                    pilots and flight attendants. Aviation exclusions typically do not exclude
                    coverage for passenger travel on regularly scheduled commercial airlines.</p>

                        insured dies as a result of suicide within a stated period of time after
                        the date that the policy was issued. Laws in most states limit the length

                        insured dies as a result of suicide during the suicide exclusion period,
                        the insurer is not liable to pay the policy face amount. Instead, the insurer’s
                        liability is limited to a return of any premiums paid for the policy minus
                        any unpaid policy loans. After the expiration of the suicide exclusion
                        period, the death of the insured as a result of suicide is covered by the
                        policy and the insurer must pay the full policy benefit.</p>

                        id="loma311-ch14-p-111">The suicide exclusion is intended to guard against antiselection, which,
                            as we have seen, is the tendency for people who are most likely to have
                            claims to be the ones most likely to apply for insurance. The general opinion
                            is that a one- or two-year exclusion period is sufficient to protect the
                            insurer against “planned suicides.” In other words, it is unlikely that
                            a person would purchase life insurance with the intention of committing
                            suicide one or two years later.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-112">Most jurisdictions have developed a strong presumption against suicide—that
                            is, the law presumes that a person’s death did <em>not</em> result from suicide.
                            If the facts of a case can be interpreted in more than one way, a court
                            usually will presume that the insured did not take his own life.</p>

                        class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-113">When an insurer refuses to pay a policy’s face amount based on the suicide
                            exclusion provision and the claimant later sues the insurer, the insurer
                            has the burden of proving that the insured’s death was caused by suicide
                            during the policy’s suicide exclusion period. An insurer’s assertion that
                            the insured committed suicide is an affirmative defense—that is, it is
                            an allegation of facts that constitutes a defense to a plaintiff’s claim.
                            Whether the insured committed suicide is a question of fact that depends
                            on all of the circumstances surrounding the death.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch14-p-114">Another question of fact that sometimes arises in suicide cases concerns
                                whether an insured was sane when she committed suicide. According to laws
                                in most states, suicide requires that the person must have intended to
                                kill herself; a person who is insane cannot form the necessary intent to
                                commit suicide. As a result, the insurer is liable to pay policy proceeds
                                if the insured died as a result of self-inflicted injury while insane.
                                To avoid this result, the suicide exclusion provision included in most
                                policies indicates that the insurer is not liable to pay the policy proceeds
                                if the insured died as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury, while <em>sane or insane</em>.</p>

                                    cannot provide the insurer with proof that the insured is dead. If a claimant
                                    cannot provide acceptable proof of her claim, the insurer will not pay
                                    the claim. When this situation occurs in the United States, a claimant
                                    can ask a court to declare the insured dead. A court’s willingness to declare
                                    a missing person dead often depends on the circumstances surrounding the
                                    person’s disappearance.</p>

                                            to Hong Kong. Mr. Milo was seen boarding the plane by several airport officials.
                                            While in flight to Hong Kong, the plane experienced mechanical failure
                                            and crashed. A subsequent investigation revealed no survivors, and Mr.
                                            Milo’s body was never recovered. In this situation, the plane crash is
                                            an identifiable cause of Mr. Milo’s disappearance, and circumstances suggest

                                        that the insured is dead. In most jurisdictions, a court’s presumption
                                        of death is a <em>rebuttable presumption</em>, which is a presumption that
                                        can be disproven but that stands until adequate evidence is presented to
                                        the contrary. Therefore, a party wishing to show that the insured is not
                                        dead is allowed to present evidence to the court to prove that fact. If
                                        a court’s presumption of death is rebutted, the insured’s status becomes
                                        a question of fact.</p>

                                                generally is entitled to recover the amount it paid under the claim because

                                                the claim. For example, an insurer may require a claimant to provide an

                                                When an insurer is involved in claim litigation, the insurer’s attorneys
                                                spend a great deal of time gathering evidence to justify the denial of
                                                the claim. Other employees of the insurer spend time gathering pertinent
                                                documents and information requested by the legal staff. In some cases,
                                                claim litigation may require employees who were involved in the claim decision
                                                to give depositions. In other cases, an employee may be called to testify
                                                at a trial. In cases such as these, a claimant may want to prove that there
                                                was an error in the process or that inappropriate considerations were applied.</p>

                                                Depending on the length and complexity of a trial, attorneys’ fees can
                                                be a significant expense for an insurer. Because of the many potential
                                                drawbacks of litigation, insurers often try to reach a compromise with

                                                            The insured died, and the insurer concluded that the beneficiary’s claim
                                                            for the basic death benefit was valid. The insurer, however, could not
                                                            clearly determine whether the insured’s death resulted from an accident
                                                            or other intervening causes. Rather than completely denying the claim for
                                                            accidental death benefits, the insurer entered into a compromise settlement
                                                            with the beneficiary under which the insurer paid the beneficiary the basic

                                                            benefits. The insurer’s liability under the contract was discharged when
                                                            it paid the agreed-upon amount to the beneficiary.</p>

                                                    they want to avoid the possibility of paying a large damage award if the
                                                    claimant files a successful lawsuit. Damage awards can decrease an insurer’s
                                                    profits and weaken its reputation.</p>

                                                    demand repayment of the amount it paid in settlement of the claim. For
                                                    example, suppose an insurer entered into a compromise settlement with a
                                                    claimant but later discovered facts indicating that the claim should not
                                                    have been paid. In the absence of fraud, the insurer cannot recover the
                                                    amount it paid because the courts will not disturb such a compromise settlement
                                                    entered into by competent parties.</p>

                                                        For a claimant to life insurance policy proceeds, this usually is the amount
