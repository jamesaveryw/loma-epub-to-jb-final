            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-111">In the United States, many aspects of a corporation’s organization and
                operation are found in the articles of incorporation and bylaws. In addition,
                a domestic corporation’s organization and operation are governed by statutes
                imposed by the state in which it is incorporated.</p>

                a framework of rules and processes for directing and controlling a corporation

                stakeholders while fulfilling strategic goals. In the United States, the

                    requires an insurer to provide information regarding corporate governance
                    practices to its state of domicile annually by June 1. The information
                    provided by an insurer is called the <em>corporate governance annual disclosure.</em>

            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-113">In a broad sense, three groups are involved in the governance of a corporation.
                These groups are (1) the board of directors, (2) the officers of the corporation,
                and (3) the stockholders.</p>

                role="doc-glossref">Directors</span> are individuals who are appointed or
                elected by the stockholders or policyholders to manage and direct the affairs
                of a corporation. State law may also provide for board seats appointed
                by members of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the state
                government. Collectively, the directors are known as the corporation’s <em>board of directors</em>.
                Directors who are otherwise employed by the corporation or are major stockholders
                of the corporation are known as <em>inside directors</em>, and typically
                are officers of the corporation. Directors who are not otherwise employed
                by or have no significant direct interest in the corporation are referred
                to as <em>outside directors</em>.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-115">Actions of a board are legally binding on the corporation if they are
                the result of a legal vote by at least a quorum of the board members. A <em>quorum</em> is
                a specified percentage of an entire body, in this case, a board of directors.
                State laws and corporate articles of incorporation or bylaws may establish
                the number or percentage of directors who must be present to constitute
                a quorum. In the absence of such controlling authority, a simple majority
                of directors constitutes a quorum.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-116">Boards of directors typically meet at scheduled times. They must meet
                at least once a year. A board of directors may act without an in-person
                meeting if all directors consent to the action in writing.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-117">A corporation’s directors have ultimate responsibility for managing and
                overseeing the corporation’s affairs. The directors exercise this responsibility
                by delegating their authority. For example, directors are responsible for
                appointing the corporation’s officers. The directors then have a duty to
                ensure that the officers manage the corporation lawfully and competently.
                Directors must have at least a basic understanding of the business that
                the corporation conducts. They also have a duty to keep informed about
                the corporation’s affairs.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-118">Directors are fiduciaries who are obligated to act in the best interests
                of the corporation and its stockholders. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-fiduciary"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch3-span-47" role="doc-glossref">fiduciary</span> is
                an entity or individual who holds a special position of trust or confidence
                when handling the affairs of another and who must put the other’s interests
                above the fiduciary’s own. As fiduciaries, directors have the following
                duties:</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch3-ul-18">
                <li id="loma311-ch3-li-73">
                    <p id="loma311-ch3-p-119"><strong>Duty of loyalty and good faith. <em>Good faith</em> </strong> is
                        the honest intent to act without taking unfair advantage of another person.
                        A director must act in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation
                        and the stockholders. A director must not misuse corporate assets or take
                        a corporate opportunity for personal benefit. A director must fully disclose
                        any conflicts of interest and should abstain from voting on matters that
                        could involve a conflict of interest.</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch3-p-120"><strong>Duty to exercise due care in carrying out responsibilities.</strong> A
                        director must use that degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person
                        would use in carrying out her own affairs. Typically, because insurers
                        occupy a special position of public trust, their directors are held to
                        a higher standard of care than are directors of other types of businesses.
                        Whether a director has exercised due care in a situation is a question
                        of fact. Although directors have a duty to use due care, they also have
                        a right to rely on information they receive from the company’s officers
                        and employees whom the directors reasonably believe are reliable and competent
                        to provide the information. If a director’s review of the corporation’s
                        affairs would raise questions in the mind of a <em>reasonably prudent person</em>,
                        then the director has a duty to inquire further. This type of duty is known
                        as the <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-reasonablepersonstandard" epub:type="glossref"

                        or understanding is compared to the actions or understanding of a hypothetical

                duties. However, U.S. courts generally provide some protection against
                such personal liability by applying the business judgment rule. The

                    for carrying out important management functions for the operation of the
                    corporation. Officers may include the CEO, president, and treasurer, to
                    name a few. A corporation’s board of directors usually appoints the top-level
                    officers in accordance with applicable state laws and the corporation’s
                    articles of incorporation and bylaws. Such appointed officers often are

                    of loyalty and a duty to exercise due care in carrying out their responsibilities.
                    In addition, laws in some states require officers to disclose all relevant
                    information to the board of directors. In this way the board is fully informed
                    before making decisions on behalf of the corporation.</p>

                id="loma311-ch3-p-128">Officers are almost always employees of the corporation. They often enter
                    into employment contracts and related types of agreements. Such a contract
                    often imposes additional duties on the officers, who may be held legally
                    liable to the corporation for violating these duties.</p>

                    are not afforded protection under the business judgment rule. They may
                    be personally liable for acts that are negligent. Recall that directors
                    may be liable for <em>gross negligence</em>, which involves an element of
                    willful misconduct. By contrast, the legal standard for officers is <em>negligent conduct</em>,
