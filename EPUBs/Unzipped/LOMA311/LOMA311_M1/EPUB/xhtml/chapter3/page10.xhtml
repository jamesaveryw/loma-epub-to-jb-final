            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-199">Governments around the world enact laws designed to protect consumers.
                For most regulatory purposes, a <em>consumer</em> is a natural person who
                purchases or tries to purchase goods or services primarily for personal,
                family, or household use. Businesses, such as insurers and companies that
                purchase group insurance, generally are not considered consumers. Thus,
                transactions between businesses are not governed by consumer protection
                laws, but by other laws. Common consumer protection laws include:</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch3-p-200"><strong>Laws that prohibit deceptive and unfair sales practices.</strong> These
                        laws are designed to provide consumers with fair and accurate information

                    <p id="loma311-ch3-p-202"><strong>Consumer credit laws.</strong> These laws require providers of
                        consumer credit—such as banks, finance companies, and credit card companies—to
                        disclose all the terms of a consumer credit transaction and to use properly
                        any personal information obtained about consumers. The intent is to promote
                        the informed use of credit and to protect consumers’ privacy.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-204">Most jurisdictions have general consumer protection laws that apply to
                    all types of businesses. Other laws apply specifically to certain types
                    of businesses. Many such general and specific laws apply to insurers. In
                    this section, we describe just a few of the <em>general consumer protection laws</em> that
                    apply to insurers operating in the United States.</p>

                    in which they purchase goods or services and finance those purchases over
                    time. One of the broadest federal laws is the Consumer Credit Protection

                            able to garnish the wages of a debtor, which means the debtor’s employer
                            is required to pay a specific portion of the debtor’s wages to the creditor

                            The FTC Act prohibits false or deceptive advertising and unfair or deceptive
                            acts or practices that affect commerce. In addition to investigating unfair
                            or deceptive conduct, the FTC enforces various consumer protection statutes
                            that prohibit specifically defined trade practices. Examples of such federal
                            consumer protection laws are the FCRA (described above), the Equal Credit
                            Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, and the Fair and Accurate Credit

                            order to stop a business from engaging in deceptive trade practices. Also,
                            consumers may file civil lawsuits against businesses that engage in deceptive
                            practices, and plaintiffs may be awarded monetary damages. Furthermore,
                            the states have specific regulations regarding how life insurers advertise
                            and sell their products as well as how they pay claims. We explore these
