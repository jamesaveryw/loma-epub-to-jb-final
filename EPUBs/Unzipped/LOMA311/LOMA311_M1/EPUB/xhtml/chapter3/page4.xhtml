                id="loma311-ch3-span-18" role="doc-glossref">stock insurance company</span> is
                an insurance company owned by its stockholders. A stock company also may
                be classified according to how its stock is sold. Large corporations, including
                many insurers, are publicly traded corporations. A <em>publicly traded corporation</em> is
                a corporation whose stock is available for sale to the general public.
                By contrast, a <em>close corporation</em>, or <em>closely held corporation</em>,
                is a corporation that has issued stock that is owned by a relatively small
                group of people, often members of the same family. The stock of a close
                corporation is not available for sale to the general public.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-62">In the United States, the process to form a corporation that intends to
                    underwrite and issue insurance is basically the same as the process for
                    other types of corporations. However, additional requirements apply. The
                    state insurance department typically must approve the formation of the
                    corporation as part of the incorporation process. By incorporating in a
                    state, an insurer subjects itself to the jurisdiction of that state’s insurance
                    department.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-63">Each state insurance department has primary responsibility for overseeing
                    the operations of its domestic insurers. Insurance departments also have
                    oversight responsibility for insurers incorporated outside their state
                    that operate within their state. Thus, each state insurance department
                    supervises the operations of domestic insurers as well as foreign and alien
                    insurers operating in the state.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-64">All states require that before transacting business within the state,

                    or <em>license</em>, which is a document issued by the state insurance department
                    that grants the insurer the right to conduct insurance business in the
                    state. This licensing requirement enables the insurance department to examine
                    the insurer’s finances and ability to pay policy benefits. The requirement
                    also enables the department to oversee the insurer’s operations.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-65">An insurer must obtain a certificate of authority from each state in which
                    it plans to do business and must conduct business in the state in compliance
                    with all applicable regulatory requirements. When an insurer receives a
                    certificate of authority, the insurer becomes subject to the jurisdiction
                    of that state’s insurance department.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-66">Because insurers must comply with the laws in all jurisdictions where
                        they operate, compliance can be costly and burdensome. One way states attempt
                        to make laws more uniform and less burdensome is by adopting model laws.

                        of state regulation by developing model insurance laws and regulations.
                        Although insurance laws vary by state, some uniformity exists because many
                        state laws are based on NAIC model laws. The NAIC makes its model laws,

                        and oversight that are substantially similar to those put forth by the
                        NAIC. A state’s NAIC accreditation is important for insurers domiciled
                        in that state because it allows insurance departments in other states where
                        the insurer operates to rely on the domiciliary state’s oversight as primary.</p>
