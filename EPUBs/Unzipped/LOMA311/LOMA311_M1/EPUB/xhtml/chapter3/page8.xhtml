                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-156">In the United States, all states have laws to regulate companies that
                    are part of an insurance holding company system. Most of these laws are
                    based in whole or in part on the <em>NAIC Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (Model Holding Company Act)</em>.
                    Laws based on the Model Holding Company Act define an <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-insuranceholdingcompanysystem"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch3-span-65" role="doc-glossref">insurance holding company system</span> as
                    two or more affiliated corporations, one or more of which is an insurer.
                    The laws are designed to protect an insurer’s policyowners from the possibility
                    that a holding company might make business decisions that could put insurance
                    coverage at risk. The laws also prevent a holding company system from separating
                    an insurer’s assets and liabilities from that insurer’s control. Following
                    are some of the requirements of state insurance holding company laws:</p>

                        <p id="loma311-ch3-p-157">The insurance department of the insurer’s domiciliary state must approve
                            any transaction in which an entity will acquire control of or merge with
                            an insurer. Approval generally is granted unless the insurance department
                            makes any of these determinations: (1) the insurer’s financial stability
                            would be threatened, (2) the transaction is unfair to the insurer’s policyowners,
                            or (3) competition in insurance would be lessened substantially.</p>

                            may invest in subsidiaries is limited.</p>

                            to the insurance department of the insurer’s domiciliary state. The insurance
                            department will disapprove a transaction if the terms of the transaction
                            are unreasonable or would threaten the insurer’s finances and ability to
                            pay policy benefits.</p>

                            to registration and periodic filing and reporting requirements. These requirements
                            are designed to enable insurance departments to oversee the operations
                            of insurance holding company systems.</p>

                        state, foreign, or savings bank. The process to become an FHC is regulated
                        by the Federal Reserve System. The <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-federalreservesystem"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch3-span-67" role="doc-glossref">Federal Reserve System (the Fed)</span> is
                        a system consisting of 12 regional banks, all national banks, and most
                        state banks. These banks are known as Fed members. The Fed has a number
                        of primary functions. It conducts the nation’s monetary policy, maintains
                        the stability of the nation’s financial system, and provides certain financial
                        services to the U.S. government, the public, and financial institutions.
                        The Fed also supervises and regulates banking institutions and protects
                        the credit rights of consumers. Although the Fed focuses primarily on banking
                        activities, it does provide oversight of financial holding companies and
                        thus some insurance companies. If an insurer is included in an FHC, then
                        the FHC also must comply with state insurance holding company laws.</p>
