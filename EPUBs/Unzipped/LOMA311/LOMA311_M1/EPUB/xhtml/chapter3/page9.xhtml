            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-163">Virtually all countries have antitrust laws designed to prevent marketplace
                practices that are anticompetitive. Governments promote competition because
                it encourages the efficient use of economic resources and tends to keep
                down the costs of producing goods and services. By keeping down production
                costs, competition also keeps down prices. For any product, the market
                operates somewhere on a continuum that ranges from pure competition to
                pure monopoly.</p>

                        id="loma311-ch3-span-68" role="doc-glossref">Pure competition</span> means
                        there are many producers and consumers of the product, and prices are established
                        by market forces with no interference from outside economic forces. In
                        theory, pure competition results in the production of the greatest output
                        of a product at the lowest price. In reality, no market operates in a state
                        of pure competition.</p>

                        of a product. Under a monopoly, there is no competition. With no competition,
                        prices tend to increase and producers are less responsive to consumer demand.</p>

                and prevent monopolies and other specified business practices that unfairly
                restrain trade. In other words, antitrust laws seek to enable the markets
                to operate as closely to a state of pure competition as possible. These
                laws ensure that markets are free and open. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch3-gt-freeandopenmarket"

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-170">Although antitrust regulations often apply to activities at the corporate
                        level, it is possible for virtually anyone in a company to violate antitrust
                        regulations. For example, industry professionals must be careful about
                        the kind of information they share outside the organization. Even a casual
                        conversation may give the appearance that competitors are sharing information
                        in violation of federal antitrust laws.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-171">Whether employees can share information with competitors depends on how
                        the information is classified. Public information—which includes information
                        about product features—can be shared. On the other hand, nonpublic information—for
                        instance, information about a marketing strategy or product pricing—should
                        not be shared.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-181">The goal of antitrust laws is not to prohibit all monopolies, but to prevent
                    illegal monopolies. An <em>illegal monopoly</em> exists when a business engages
                    in anticompetitive conduct to control the market for a product or service.
                    In other words, the business obtained its power through unfair competition
                    or dishonest practices. Anticompetitive tactics include those that unreasonably
                    exclude businesses from the market or that significantly impair others’
                    ability to compete in a market—for example, through price fixing or price
                    discrimination.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-182">Some monopolies are legal. A business that gained monopoly power through
                    fair competition and legitimate tactics has not violated the antitrust
                    laws. For instance, a company can gain a monopoly by being the only business
                    that is able or willing to provide a specific product.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch3-p-183">Certain activities are prohibited by federal antitrust laws when the activities
                    are part of an agreement between competing businesses. Here are some examples
                    of such prohibited agreements between competitors:</p>

                        <p id="loma311-ch3-p-184">Competitors may not enter into an agreement to divide up a market by geographical
                            territory or by customers. Such agreements are per se violations because

                                because they create monopoly power. Federal law requires that parties to

                                the proposed transaction. Whether a particular transaction must be reported
                                depends on the value of the acquisition and the size of the parties, as
                                measured by their sales and assets. Also, other acquisitions that are likely
                                to raise antitrust concerns must be reported.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-193">After notification, the FTC and DOJ have a stated period of time in which
                                to evaluate the proposed transaction. The agencies’ evaluation is aimed
                                at determining whether the transaction would substantially concentrate
                                market power and make it difficult for new firms to enter the market. If
                                the FTC or DOJ believes that a proposed transaction violates the antitrust
                                laws, they may seek an injunction in federal district court to prohibit
                                the parties from completing the transaction.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch3-p-194">Various legal sanctions may be imposed against individuals and businesses
                        that violate federal antitrust laws. Some violations are crimes that are
                        handled by the DOJ and punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Civil penalties,
                        including substantial fines, also may be imposed. A person who has been
                        harmed by a violation of federal antitrust laws has the right to file a
                        lawsuit in federal court against the businesses or individuals who committed
                        the violation. A plaintiff who is successful in such a lawsuit is entitled
                        to recover from the defendants <em>treble damages</em>—an amount equal to
                        three times the actual damages—plus reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch3-p-195">Most countries outside the United States have enacted antitrust laws.
                            For instance, in Canada the <em>Competition Act</em> is a federal law that
                            governs most business conduct to prevent anticompetitive market practices.
                            Although the details of antitrust laws vary by jurisdiction, the same types
                            of activities prohibited in the United States generally are prohibited
                            in other nations. However, U.S. antitrust laws are unique in these ways:</p>

                                <p id="loma311-ch3-p-196">As a general rule, no other country has antitrust laws that are as strict
                                    as those in the United States. Also, the United States enforces its antitrust
                                    laws more vigorously than do most other countries.</p>

                                <p id="loma311-ch3-p-197">Other countries generally do not try to regulate anticompetitive conduct
                                    when it occurs beyond their geographic borders. With regard to the United
                                    States, anticompetitive conduct that affects domestic or foreign commerce
                                    may violate the U.S. antitrust laws regardless of where such conduct occurs
                                    or the nationality of the parties involved.</p>

                                    are not considered crimes punishable by imprisonment as in the United States.</p>
