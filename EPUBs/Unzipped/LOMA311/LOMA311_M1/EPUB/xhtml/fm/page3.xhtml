                <p id="loma311-fm-p-24">On behalf of LOMA and its membership, we would like to thank all LOMA
                    311 text reviewers and the companies that supported their efforts. Text
                    reviewers are busy industry professionals who actively support the educational
                    needs of current and future industry employees and generously volunteer
                    their time and expertise to review a textâ€™s content. The LOMA 311 text
                    development panel made substantive contributions, commented on the developing
                    chapters, provided suggestions for additional content, submitted relevant
                    research materials, and answered numerous questions posed by LOMA staff.
                    LOMA is responsible for the accuracy and clarity of the text, and takes
                    responsibility for any errors.</p>
