            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-126">A plaintiff files a civil action to seek a remedy for the wrong she suffered
                as a result of the defendant’s conduct. If the plaintiff successfully wins
                her case, the remedies available vary depending on the nature of the plaintiff’s
                cause of action.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch2-p-127">Common law jurisdictions generally categorize remedies as either legal
                or equitable. This categorization results from the way that England’s common
                law courts developed remedies. Originally, English courts followed rigid,
                formalized procedures that provided only limited and specific remedies,
                which came to be known as <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-legalremedies"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch2-span-80" role="doc-glossref">legal remedies</span>.
                These remedies primarily involved the payment of money damages to injured
                parties. Over time, legal remedies were inadequate to remedy some wrongs.
                The English government established separate courts, known as <em>courts of equity </em>or
                sometimes as<em> chancery courts</em>, to provide new remedies. The courts
                of equity were not bound by the existing rigid procedures and were given
                discretionary power to base their decisions on moral rights and concepts
                of justice. The remedies developed by the equity courts were known as
                <span
                class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-equitableremedies" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch2-span-81"
                role="doc-glossref">equitable remedies</span>. Today, the courts in common law jurisdictions
                    are empowered to grant both legal and equitable remedies, although they
                    may be separated into law and chancery divisions. We discuss remedies available
                    to the parties to a life insurance contract in Chapter 13.</p>

                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch2-p-130">The amount of compensatory damages to be awarded a plaintiff is a question
                    of fact. Once a defendant’s liability has been established, the trier of
                    fact must determine the amount of damages to be awarded the plaintiff.
                    The measure used for this decision varies depending on the specific facts
                    of the case. In all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of proving with
                    reasonable certainty the amount of her losses. In addition, a defendant
                    generally is liable only for those losses that were the foreseeable result
                    of his actions. A loss is foreseeable if it would ordinarily be expected
                    to result from the wrongful actions or if the defendant knew of specific
                    facts that would make the loss likely.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch2-p-131">In an action for breach of contract, compensatory damages generally are
                    measured as the <em>benefit of the bargain</em>. This damage award is that
                    amount that will put the plaintiff in the financial position she would
                    have been in if the contract had been performed.</p>

                            Supermassive Cybersecurity Services. However, Balustrade suffered a breach
                            in its cybersecurity when Supermassive failed to properly deploy a promised
                            software upgrade in a timely fashion, as Supermassive was contractually
                            obliged to do. Balustrade gave Supermassive several opportunities to correct
                            the problem, but Supermassive failed to do so. As a result, Balustrade
                            was forced to pay another vendor $800,000 to install a comparable software
                            upgrade. Balustrade filed an action for breach of contract against Supermassive.
                            The court found in favor of Balustrade and ordered Supermassive to pay
                            Balustrade $800,000 in compensatory damages.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch2-p-134">In an action based on a tort, compensatory damages generally include losses
                    for personal injuries and/or property damage. Personal injury losses include
                    physical, mental, and emotional injuries and typically consist of the amount
                    of the plaintiff’s medical expenses and loss of earnings, including the
                    loss of future earnings. Damage awards also include amounts to compensate
                    the plaintiff for the pain and suffering that resulted from the defendant’s
                    wrongful conduct.</p>

                    id="loma311-ch2-span-84" role="doc-glossref">Punitive damages</span>, or <em>exemplary damages</em>,
                    are damages awarded in addition to compensatory damages when a defendant’s
                    wrongful conduct was malicious or willful. The purpose of a punitive damage
                    award is to punish the defendant and to deter others from similar conduct.
                    For instance, a court may award punitive damages in intentional tort cases
                    and occasionally in cases based on negligence. An example of an intentional
                    tort that might result in punitive damages for an insurer is fraudulent
                    misrepresentation, such as if an insurer were to commit fraud by selling
                    a policy under false claims. Punitive damages generally are <em>not</em> available
                    in actions based on breach of contract unless the breach was wanton, willful,
                    and deliberate.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch2-p-136">Sometimes, a plaintiff is awarded <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-nominaldamages"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch2-span-85" role="doc-glossref">nominal damages</span> when
                    she was wronged but she did not suffer a loss as a result of the wrong,
                    she cannot prove the amount of the loss with reasonable certainty, or the
                    loss was trivial. In such cases, the plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory
                    damages, because she failed to prove the amount of her damages with reasonable
                    certainty. If the defendant’s conduct was wrongful, however, the trier
                    of fact may award the plaintiff a small sum. For example, assume that the
                    defendant trespassed on the plaintiff’s land but did not damage the plaintiff
                    in any measurable way. The trier of fact might award the plaintiff nominal
                    damages of one dollar. Nominal damages may be awarded both in tort and
                    contract actions.</p>

                    The plaintiff cannot recover damages for a loss that she could have avoided
                    or lessened by reasonable efforts. Thus, the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate
                    damages is an affirmative defense to a civil action. The defendant may
                    use the affirmative defense to reduce the amount of damages that he is

                                order specific performance of contracts for the sale of land. Because of
                                the uniqueness of land, when the seller breaches such a contract, the buyer
                                often suffers a loss that cannot be compensated with money damages, based
                                on the buyer’s intended use for the land. Courts, however, will not order
                                the specific performance of certain kinds of contracts, such as employment
                                contracts.</p>

                        other times an equitable remedy in which a party is ordered to return property
                        to its owner or to the person entitled to it. The basic purpose of restitution
                        is to prevent unjust enrichment: A person should not be allowed to profit
                        or be enriched as a result of a wrong committed at the expense of another
                        person. Restitution is available in civil actions in which it is more appropriate
                        to restore to the plaintiff what the defendant received than to award damages
                        in the amount of the plaintiff’s losses. For example, assume that a person
                        overpays an amount owed to another. The party who receives such an overpayment
                        would be unjustly enriched if she keeps the amount overpaid and, thus,
                        may be ordered to repay that amount. Similarly, the court would commonly
                        order a person who wrongfully takes the property of another to return the
                        property to its owner.</p>
