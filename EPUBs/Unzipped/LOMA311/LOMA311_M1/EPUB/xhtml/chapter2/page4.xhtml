            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-94">Tort law is of interest to insurers in part because an insurer can easily
                be either the plaintiff or the defendant in a tort action. Recall that
                the legal definition of a tort states that the law provides a remedy to
                the wronged party. In the United States, each state has developed a body
                of tort law that creates rights and imposes corresponding duties on individuals,
                and apportions responsibility when a breach of a legal duty results in
                loss to another person. Although laws vary somewhat from state to state,
                we describe some of the general principles of tort law found in the laws
                of most states. Virtually all countries provide remedies to those who are
                injured by another person’s wrongful (tortious) actions as described in
                this section.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch2-p-95">The law of torts focuses on compensating the victims of torts rather than
                on punishing the wrongdoers. An individual who breaches a legal duty that
                she owes to another person and thereby harms the other person is financially
                liable for the loss to the injured person. Whether an individual has met
                her legal duty depends on whether her conduct met the standard of care
                that the law requires.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch2-p-96">The common law recognizes three general theories on which liability for
                tortious conduct can be based: intentional torts, negligence, and strict
                liability.</p>

                a private wrong committed by a person who intended to do something that
                the law declares a wrong. The common law imposes liability for a variety
                of specific intentional torts, which are either wrongs against another
                person or wrongs against another person’s property. Intentional torts against
                another person include assault, battery, defamation, fraudulent misrepresentation,
                and inducing a breach of contract. Intentional torts against another person’s
                property include trespass to land and conversion. The intentional torts
                most frequently relevant to insurance companies include defamation and
                fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>

                id="loma311-ch2-span-63" role="doc-glossref">defamation</span> occurs when
                a person makes false statements that injure the good name or reputation
                of another person. Defamation takes two forms: (1) <em>slander</em>, when
                the defamatory statements are made orally, and (2) <em>libel</em>, when
                the defamatory statements are made in writing. To succeed in a civil action
                for defamation, a plaintiff typically must prove that (1) the defendant
                made a false statement about the plaintiff, (2) the defendant communicated
                the statement to a third party, and (3) the statement injured the plaintiff’s
                reputation.</p>

                when a person knowingly or willfully makes a false statement with the intent
                that another person will rely on the statement and will be harmed as a
                result of that reliance. To prove that a defendant knowingly or willfully
                made such a false statement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant
                made a misrepresentation either (1) with knowledge of its falsity, (2)
                without belief in its truth, or (3) with reckless or careless disregard
                for whether it is true. In Chapter Four, we will discuss other misrepresentations
                that may or may not be intentional.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-100">The elements of a cause of action based on an intentional tort vary depending
                on the specific tort involved. To prevail in any cause of action based
                on an intentional tort, however, the plaintiff usually must prove that
                the defendant acted with intent. A defendant acts with intent when she
                desires to produce the results that follow from her wrongful act.</p>

                                The law imposes a general duty of care on all activities: a person typically
                                has a legal duty to act as a reasonably prudent person of like knowledge

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-109">A defendant often defends a negligence lawsuit by trying to prove that
                                he was not negligent. For example, the defendant may try to show that he
                                did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care or that his actions were not the
                                cause of the plaintiff’s loss. Even if a plaintiff’s injuries were the
                                result of the defendant’s negligence, the defendant may be able to defeat
                                the plaintiff’s claim in whole or in part with an affirmative defense such
                                as contributory negligence or assumption of the risk.</p>

                                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch2-span-68" role="doc-glossref"> contributory negligence</span> is
                                available when the plaintiff’s own negligence contributed to her loss.
                                According to the original common law rule of contributory negligence, a
                                plaintiff who was responsible to any extent for her loss was denied any
                                recovery from the defendant. To reduce the harshness of this rule, most
                                states have modified their laws by adapting a system of <span class="gt"
                                data-term="ch2-gt-comparativenegligence" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch2-span-69"
                                role="doc-glossref">comparative negligence</span>, which apportions losses
                                between plaintiffs and defendants when both parties’ negligence contributed
                                to a plaintiff’s losses. With comparative negligence, a plaintiff who was
                                contributorily negligent may recover from the defendant, but the amount
                                of that recovery is reduced in proportion to the plaintiff’s fault. For
                                example, assume that the trier of fact determines that a plaintiff was
                                20 percent at fault for her losses and the defendant was 80 percent at
                                fault. The defendant will be held liable to the plaintiff for 80 percent
                                of her losses. In some states, comparative negligence laws allow a plaintiff
                                to recover from the defendant only if the defendant was 50 percent or more,
                                or in other states more than 50 percent, at fault.</p>

                                an affirmative defense that totally bars a plaintiff’s claim when the plaintiff

                                and voluntarily incurred that risk. For example, if a plaintiff was injured
                                during a skydiving accident, the court might deny her claim on the basis
                                that she was fully aware that skydiving is an inherently risky activity.
                                Whether a plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk is a question of fact.</p>

                                risk by merging the rule into a system of comparative negligence. Some
                                states have adopted laws of comparative fault that are similar to comparative
                                negligence laws but are broader and include tortious conduct other than

                                    is, liability imposed by tort law without regard for whether the defendant
                                    was at fault—applies only in very restricted situations, such as when a
                                    defendant engages in extremely hazardous activities. For example, blasting
                                    with dynamite is a hazardous activity that may cause harm to others. A
                                    defendant is liable for losses caused by such activities even if the defendant
                                    was not negligent or otherwise at fault for the losses.</p>

                                                “No Trespassing” and “Danger Zone” signs before entering the property.
                                                She suffered an injury while on the premises. Ms. Keynes sued the company
                                                that owned the property for damages. The property owner’s insurance company,
                                                Morningstar Life Insurance, argued that its insured had posted clear warning
                                                signs about the dangers inherent to the ongoing construction, and Ms. Keynes
                                                was aware of those dangers when she chose to trespass. Morningstar is using

                                            “No Trespassing” and “Danger Zone” signs before entering the property.
                                            She suffered an injury while on the premises. Ms. Keynes sued the company
                                            that owned the property for damages. The property owner’s insurance company,
                                            Morningstar Life Insurance, argued that its insured had posted clear warning
                                            signs about the dangers inherent to the ongoing construction, and Ms. Keynes
                                            was aware of those dangers when she chose to trespass. Morningstar is using
                                            the affirmative defense known as (<strong>comparative negligence</strong> / <strong>assumption of the risk</strong>).</p>
