            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-31">Civil disputes are an inevitable part of doing business in the life insurance
                industry. A corporation that controls extensive financial resources is
                the frequent target of lawsuits, some of which may be frivolous. The civil
                litigation process can work both to a company’s advantage and to the company’s
                disadvantage. For example, an insurer could rely on a court to settle a
                dispute between two beneficiaries, but the same insurer could also be subject
                to a lawsuit in which a person challenges the insurer’s decision to deny
                a claim. Therefore, an insurer must be aware of a court system’s rules
                and procedures that define civil court proceedings. Specific rules and
                procedures vary slightly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but the general
                procedures and principles we describe are fairly uniform across the United
                States.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch2-h3-1">The Parties</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-32">Judicial proceedings begin when an injured party, known as the <span class="gt"
                data-term="ch2-gt-plaintiff" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch2-span-17"

                This process is also known as <em>instituting</em> a lawsuit. The plaintiff
                and defendant are each a <span class="gt" data-term="ch2-gt-party" epub:type="glossref"

                Any legal person, as defined earlier, can be a party to a civil action.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch2-p-33">A civil action consists of three distinct stages: the pleading stage,
                    the discovery stage, and the trial stage. Note, however, that the parties
                    have the right to settle their dispute at any time. As a result, a civil
                    action may terminate by agreement of the parties at any time before the
                    court reaches a verdict. Watch Video 2.1 for a walkthrough of these three
                    stages.</p>

                            disputes typically are heard by a judge or panel of judges. A case involving
                            a private dispute begins when the parties file pleadings, which state the
                            issues in general terms. Where a case in a common law jurisdiction typically
                            culminates in a trial, a case in a civil law jurisdiction usually proceeds
                            with a series of meetings, hearings, and written documents through which
                            evidence is presented. The judge guides the evidence-gathering process,
                            questions all witnesses, and evaluates the admissibility and weight of
                            all evidence presented. The judge renders the verdict at the final hearing
