                        the courts follow a general rule known as the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em>.
                        According to this doctrine, when a court finds that a specific principle
                        of law applies to a certain set of facts, the court will apply that principle
                        to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same. The
                        decision in such a prior case is known as a precedent. By relying on precedent,
                        the courts are able to enforce the laws in a uniform, predictable, and

                    means that the matter has been decided—is to ensure that parties will not
                    relitigate matters that the courts have already decided. The doctrine thus
                    promotes judicial efficiency and enables the parties to rely on the finality

                                defendant engages in extremely hazardous activities such as blasting with
                                dynamite. Under the common law theory of strict liability, a defendant
                                is held liable for losses caused by his tortious conduct even if the defendant
                                was not negligent or otherwise at fault for the losses.</p>

                            resolution in the United States. Contracts often require that any disputes
                            that arise between the contracting parties be resolved through (<strong>arbitration / mediation</strong>)
                            rather than through civil litigation. In many countries, conciliation is
                            a dispute resolution method that is similar to (<strong>arbitration / mediation</strong>)
                            in that a third party facilitates negotiations and encourages the parties
                            to resolve the dispute themselves through a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>

                                debts generally is limited to the amount of the owner’s investment in the

                                    some uniformity exists because many state laws are based on NAIC model
                                    laws. A state’s NAIC accreditation is important for insurers domiciled
                                    in that state because it allows insurance departments in other states where
                                    the insurer operates to rely on the domiciliary state’s oversight as primary.
                                    Although an insurer does not have to submit a different application to
                                    each insurance department, the specific requirements for a certificate
                                    of authority vary by state.</p>

                                    and consumers of the product, and prices are established by market forces
                                    with not interference from outside economic forces. In reality, no market
                                    operates in a state of pure competition. In a monopoly, one firm, or a
                                    group of firms acting together, controls the production and distribution
                                    of a produce. Under a monopoly, there is no competition.</p>

                                terms. They allow the courts to decide what specific activities are illegal
                                based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The courts have identified
                                certain activities that are so harmful to consumers that they are conclusively
                                presumed to violate the antitrust laws. Such prohibited activities are
                                referred to as per se violations. The courts evaluate all cases that are
                                not per se violations under a rule of reason analysis, which evaluates
                                the overall competitive effect of the parties’ conduct and weighs the competitive
                                harm against the competitive benefits.</p>
                            <p class="explanations">Statement A is incorrect. Because a monopoly is not always illegal, it
                                is not an example of a per se violation of antitrust laws. For example,
                                a business that gained monopoly power through fair competition and legitimate
                                tactics has not violated the antitrust laws.</p>
