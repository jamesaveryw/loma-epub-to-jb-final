                    <p>When a court in a Common Law System makes a decision, it first looks to
                        the applicable written law—statutes and regulations.</p>
                    <p>But what if no statutes or regulations apply?</p>
                    <p>If no statutes or regulations apply, then the court applies the doctrine
                        of stare decisis by following precedents, unless strong reasons justify
                        a departure from precedent.</p>
                    <p>But what if no precedents apply?</p>
                    <p>If no precedents apply, then the court applies general principles of the

                    </p>
                    <p>When a court in a Civil Law System makes a decision, it first looks at
                        the applicable code.</p>

                        civil law.</p>
                    <p>Although not bound to follow precedents, the court will be influenced

                        responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Highest floor: A fiduciary generally is held to the highest standard of
                        care. We discuss fiduciaries in more detail in Chapter 3.</p>
                    <p>Second-highest floor: Professionals, such as physicians, attorneys, and
                        accountants, generally are held to a higher standard of care than are non-professionals.
                        They are required to have the special knowledge and skills needed to carry
                        out their professions and to use reasonable care.</p>
                    <p>Second-lowest floor: The average person has the legal duty to act as a
                        reasonably prudent person of like knowledge or skill.</p>
                    <p>Lowest floor: Children generally are held to a lower standard of care
                        than adults. A child generally is required to act like a reasonable person
                        of the child’s age, experience, and intelligence. Certain actions, when
                        taken by a child, may not be negligent, whereas the same actions taken
                        by an adult might be negligent.</p>

                    <p>Text, first bubble: Liquidated damages: A sum of money that the parties
                        to a contract have specified in their agreement as the amount of damages
                        to be recovered by a party if the other party breaches the contract.</p>
                    <p>Footnote, first bubble: The courts generally enforce a liquidated damages
                        provision if it appears that the contracting parties set the amount of
                        damages fairly.</p>
                    <p>Text, second bubble: Prospective damages: Damages that have not occurred
                        at the time of the trial of a case but that are reasonably likely to occur
                        as a result of the defendant’s conduct.</p>
                    <p>Text, third bubble: Statutory damages: Damages that are awarded under
                        the provisions of a statute rather than under the common law rules governing
                        damages for civil wrongs.</p>
                    <p>Footnote, third bubble: For example, under some statutes, a state’s Insurance
                        Fraud Prevention act may provide for the potential for an insurer to collect
                        treble damages as a way to dissuade fraudulent acts.</p>
                    <p>Text at dividing line: The below types of damages generally are not awarded
                        in civil actions in the United States.</p>
                    <p>Text, fourth bubble: Remote damages: Damages for losses that the defendant
                        could not reasonably have anticipated resulting from a given set of facts.</p>
                    <p>Footnote, fourth bubble: Generally, civil damages are awarded only for
                        those losses that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position could
                        have foreseen would result from the defendant’s actions.</p>
                    <p>Text, fifth bubble: Speculative damages: Damages that may occur in the
                        future as a result of the defendant’s actions but that also depend on the
                        occurrence of other uncertain contingencies.</p>

                    <p>Three definitions with icons.</p>
                    <p>Unfair price discrimination: A seller agrees to sell goods to a buyer
                        at a price lower than the price charged other buyers <em>under the same circumstances</em>.
                        A seller is <em>not</em> violating antitrust laws if it enters into price
                        agreements administered fairly and in an otherwise nondiscriminatory fashion.
                        For example, a seller can give a buyer a volume discount.</p>
                    <p>Tying arrangements: A tying arrangement is an illegal arrangement under
                        which a business will sell one product to a purchaser only if the purchaser
                        also buys a second, different product from the firm.</p>
                    <p>Boycotts: Competitors agree not to do business with another business.
                        Often, companies engaging in a boycott use coercion and intimidation to
                        force others to join in the boycott.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Protects workers who are age 40 and older from being discriminated against

                        <li>Applies to employers with 20 or more employees</li>
                        <li>Prohibits employers from refusing to hire and from firing individuals
                            40 and older because of their age</li>
                        <li>Employers also cannot discriminate regarding compensation and other terms
                            and conditions of employment because of a person’s age</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>In the European Union, workers are protected against employment discrimination
                        based on their sex, racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, age, disability,
                        or religion.</p>

                <p class="fig-title">Sole Proprietorships and General Partnerships</p>
                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>Sole proprietorships and general partnerships are similar in several ways.</p>
                    <p><strong>What government action is required to create the business?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Typically, NO government action is needed to create a sole proprietorship
                        or general partnership other than to obtain the required local business
                        licenses or permits.</p>
                    <p>Such requirements typically are imposed on all businesses without regard
                        to their legal form.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are profits and personal liability accounted for?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The sole proprietor or partners reap all the profits.</p>
                    <p>They also have unlimited personal liability for the debts of the business.</p>
                    <p>Thus, creditors of the business can sue the owner(s) personally and can
                        obtain a court judgment against them.</p>
                    <p>A judgment enables the creditor to recover the debt by taking the personal
                        property of the sole proprietor or partners.</p>
                    <p><strong>How are taxes handled?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the business is not taxed as a legal
                        entity.</p>
                    <p>A sole proprietor files an individual tax return and reports all profits
                        from the business as income; the partners each file an individual tax return
                        and report their share of the profits from the business as income. This
                        income is taxed at individual tax rates.</p>
                    <p><strong>How long does the business operate?</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The business operates only as long as the owner(s) want it to continue.</p>
                    <p>However, a sole proprietorship ceases to exist if the owner dies.</p>
                    <p>A partnership dissolves by operation of law if: (1) any of the partners
                        dies or (2) upon the bankruptcy of any of the partners.</p>
                    <p>After such a death or bankruptcy, the remaining partners may agree to
                        re-form the partnership under a new partnership agreement.</p>
