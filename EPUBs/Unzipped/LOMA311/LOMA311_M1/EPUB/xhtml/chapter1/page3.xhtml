                that determine the powers and duties of the government and the rights of
                the people. It is a basic part of a country’s legal system and is intended
                to be a relatively permanent and primary source of law. A constitution
                typically is considered the supreme law of the land. Any laws found to
                violate a country’s constitution generally are invalid.</p>

                a constitution usually establishes the organizational structure of the

                (1) create the laws, (2) administer and enforce the laws, and (3) resolve
                disputes. Therefore, in most countries the constitution divides governmental

                    id="loma311-ch1-p-41">Specific details of how a parliamentary system operates vary by country,
                        but the executive branch of government typically is led by a prime minister.
                        The prime minister is the individual who heads the political party—or coalition
                        of parties—that holds a majority of elected seats in the Parliament. Upon
                        taking office, the prime minister names a Cabinet of individuals who serve
                        as advisors.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-42">The individuals who make up the executive branch hold office as long as
                        the Parliament has confidence in how the executive branch is leading the
                        government. If the Parliament votes that it no longer has confidence in
                        the executive branch’s ability to lead the government, the prime minister
                        and the Cabinet resign and Parliament is dissolved. Then elections are
                        held to create a new Parliament from which the next prime minister will
                        be elected.</p>

                    law. All other laws must be consistent with the constitution. Typically,
                    each state also has a state constitution that serves as the state’s fundamental
                    law. All state laws must be consistent with the federal constitution and
                    the applicable state constitution. The federal constitution typically provides
                    a method of dividing governmental powers between the federal and state
                    governments.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-46">As an example, the U.S. Constitution enumerates the specific powers that
                    are delegated to the federal government, and all governmental powers not
                    specifically given to the federal government are left to the state governments.
                    The states are responsible for a range of functions, including regulating
                    businesses and professions within their borders, providing for public schools,
                    and protecting the health and safety of people. States delegate some of

                    The names given to such codes vary by jurisdiction. In the United States,

                    the U.S. Code that is generally referred to as the Internal Revenue Code

                        comply with all state insurance laws. In addition, the insurance department
                        adopts <em>regulations</em> to fill in the details of the state insurance

                        under the direction of an official typically known as the <em>insurance commissioner</em>.</p>

                            the opportunity to comment. At the end of the comment period, the agency
                            considers the comments and may finalize the regulation with or without
                            changes. If the changes are substantial, the agency may re-propose the
                            regulation. From time to time, the agency may clarify a regulation by issuing
                            a bulletin or other document, which is sometimes called <em>sub-regulatory guidance</em>.</p>

                                a legally binding agreement entered into by two or more nations that agree
                                to abide by the terms of the agreement. Treaties may be referred to by
                                various terms, including <em>conventions</em> and <em>pacts</em>. When a nation
                                signs a treaty, it generally agrees to enforce the terms of the treaty
                                within its borders. It also agrees to cooperate with other nations in enforcing
                                the treaty. There are many types of treaties. Political treaties establish
                                military alliances, end wars, and settle boundary disputes, among other
                                things. Commercial treaties deal with trade and tariff issues. Countries
                                enter into legal treaties under which they agree to abide by common patent
                                and copyright protections. As Chapter 3 shows, certain treaties, such as
                                those regarding money laundering and international trade, apply to insurers.</p>

                                    laws provide a guideline of how cases proceed through a court system. Additionally,

                                            situation may be unclear. In such cases, the courts generally have authority
                                            to interpret the meaning of statutes. These decisions are considered by
                                            subsequent courts that may be called upon to decide similar issues. In
