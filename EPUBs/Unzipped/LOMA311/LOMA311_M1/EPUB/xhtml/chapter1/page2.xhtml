            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch1-p-23">The life insurance industry is of such importance to so many people that
                it occupies a special position of public trust. Millions of families rely
                on life insurance and annuity products for savings and financial protection
                against the risks of dying too soon or outliving assets. Also, the reserves
                held by life insurers are one of the largest sources of private funds in
                the world’s financial markets.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-24">Life insurers balance the needs of a variety of stakeholders. By
                <span
                class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-stakeholders" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch1-span-6"
                role="doc-glossref">stakeholders</span>we mean the parties who have an interest in how the
                    company conducts its business. A life insurance company’s stakeholders
                    include stockholders (for stock companies), the board of directors, executives,
                    managers, employees, agents, potential customers, policyowners, beneficiaries,
                    annuity participants, and regulators, among others.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-25">The financial health and business practices of life insurance companies
                are of such importance to society that governments rely on the legal system
                to put in place specific insurance laws and regulations that safeguard
                this public trust. Also, in a business as complex and important as the
                life insurance industry, mistakes and disagreements happen, and the parties
                often turn to the legal system to resolve disputes.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-26">A legal system includes two major components: (1) <em>laws and regulations</em> that
                regulate conduct and (2) <em>legal processes</em> to enforce those laws and
                regulations. The laws and regulations provide guidelines and rules to help
                people, companies, and governments interact in an orderly way. The legal
                processes are used to resolve disputes, provide remedies for victims, and
                punish those who break laws. A legal system enables individuals and organizations
                to anticipate the outcomes of their actions with some certainty, manage
                affairs with a minimum of conflict, and resolve disputes fairly.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-27">Life insurers, like most other businesses, must comply with general business
                regulations. They also must comply with insurance regulations. Furthermore,
                certain areas of law, such as contract law, agency law, and property law,
                have a significant impact on how life insurers conduct business.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-28">For years, leaders in the life insurance industry have cited regulation
                    as a major challenge. This observation is especially true today. Increased
                    competition and customer expectations put pressure on companies to innovate.
                    Technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and predictive
                    analytics are driving new business models. As companies change the way
                    they do business, they increase the risk of not complying with existing
                    laws. Not only must insurers comply with all existing laws, they must contend
                    with new and evolving regulations and court decisions. Insurers must be
                    careful to avoid fines, lawsuits, and negative publicity, all of which
                    can harm the company’s reputation and profits.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-29"><em>Business Law for Insurance Professionals</em> provides a basic knowledge
                        of the legal system as well as legal and regulatory issues unique to the
                        life insurance industry. With the knowledge this course provides, you will
                        be more aware of potential legal and regulatory challenges that may arise
                        as you perform your job. In many cases, employees are considered agents
                        of the company, and their communications and activities create legally
                        binding obligations. An understanding of legal and regulatory principles
                        can help you become a more effective employee.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-30">Although this text focuses primarily on the United States, the types of
                        legal issues it addresses apply in most countries. For students who work
                        outside the United States, familiarity with these issues should help prepare
                        you for the challenges of your own legal system. Specific laws vary by
                        country, but many legal principles are similar around the world. Also,
                        as globalization of the life insurance industry continues, many insurers
                        and their employees must understand how the legal system works in every
                        country in which their company operates.</p>
