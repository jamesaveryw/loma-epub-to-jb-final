                have a court system. Each court system operates as a separate and independent
                unit. In this section, we describe the organization of the federal and
                state court systems in the United States. The insight below provides two
                other examples of how judicial systems are organized.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-126">Like the United States, Argentina has a federal system of government and
                        a federal court system. Argentina also has created a provincial court system.
                        Federal courts have jurisdiction over matters involving the federal government,
                        conflicts between provinces, and certain matters specified by federal law.
                        Provincial courts have jurisdiction over all other matters. Federal and
                        provincial courts have overlapping jurisdiction in many matters.</p>
                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-127">The federal Supreme Court of Justice is the highest court in the nation.
                        Specialized federal courts, known as <em>forums</em>, each have jurisdiction
                        over specific matters. Such courts include a civil forum, a criminal forum,
                        a labor forum, an administrative forum, a family forum, and a commercial
                        forum. The provincial court systems are similarly organized, with a Supreme
                        Court and specialized courts. Provincial court systems usually include
                        at least three forums: a civil forum, a criminal forum, and a labor forum.</p>

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch1-p-129">Although Hong Kong is a region of China, it has an independent court system
                                composed of a number of courts. Lower courts include the District Court,
                                which is a court of original jurisdiction that hears both civil and criminal
                                cases; a number of Magistrates’ Courts that hear criminal cases; the Labour
                                Tribunal that handles disputes between employers and employees; and the
                                Small Claims Tribunal that hears civil cases involving less than a stated
                                sum of money. The highest appellate court is the Court of Final Appeal.
                                It hears both civil and criminal appeals from the High Court. The High
                                Court consists of two separate courts:</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch1-p-132"><em>District courts</em> sit in every state and territory and act as trial
                        courts with jurisdiction to hear only specific types of cases as set out
                        in the Constitution and various federal laws. A federal law might, for
                        instance, require a matter to exceed a specified value or dollar amount
                        for it to be heard by a district court. Figure 1.5 identifies the types
                        of cases over which the Constitution gives jurisdiction to the federal

                have only limited jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases. For example,
                the U.S. Tax Court has jurisdiction to hear disputes between taxpayers
                and the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involving the payment of
                federal taxes.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch1-p-137">As noted earlier, each state court system includes a variety of trial
                courts. In the United States, each trial court is presided over by a judicial
                officer, who is generally called a <span class="gt" data-term="ch1-gt-judge"

                Most states have two levels of appellate courts. The higher-level appellate
                court—usually known as the state <em>supreme court</em>—has authority to
                review the decisions of the lower appellate court—often known as the state <em>court of appeal</em>.</p>
