                                the principal, the principal is known as a partially disclosed principal.
                                Clubland is an undisclosed principal with respect to the contract.</p>

                            <p class="explanations">A trademark identifies and distinguishes the source of one party’s goods
                                from those of other parties, whereas a service mark is used to identify
                                and distinguish the source of a service. StoneCare can correctly be described
                                as a trademark because it identifies and distinguishes the source of Jade’s
                                jewelry cleaning product—a good—from the goods of other parties. Also,
                                a U.S. trademark registration generally remains in force for 10 years.
                                Registrations can be renewed for additional 10-year periods by paying the
                                applicable fee and filing with the USPTO an affidavit attesting to the
                                registrant’s continuing use of the mark.</p>

                            <p class="q-stem-static">On March 1, the Glenside Corporation obtained a loan from Summit Bank
                                and gave Summit a security interest in some of its property. Summit perfected
                                its security interest in the property on March 15. On May 1, Glenside obtained
                                a loan from Epitome Bank and gave Epitome a security interest in the same
                                property. Epitome perfected its security interest in the property on May
                                20.</p>
                            <p class="q-stem-static">When Glenside defaulted on both loans, it owed $15,000 to Summit Bank
                                and $10,000 to Epitome Bank. Summit and Epitome were Glenside’s only creditors.
                                Summit foreclosed on the property, sold the property for $18,000, and incurred
                                $1,000 in foreclosure costs. With regard to the sale of Glenside’s property,
                                it is correct to say that Summit Bank is entitled to receive</p>

                            <p class="explanations">The proceeds from a sale of foreclosed property go to pay the expenses
                                incurred in the foreclosure proceeding and to satisfy the debtor’s obligation
                                to the creditor. If any proceeds remain, they may be used to pay other
                                creditors that have a security interest in the property. In this case,
                                Summit—as the first creditor to perfect its security interest—is entitled
                                to receive $15,000 to satisfy the amount of Glenside’s loan. Summit is
                                also entitled to retain the $1,000 in costs it incurred for the foreclosure
                                proceeding. Epitome is entitled to the remaining $2,000 ($18,000 – $15,000
                                – $1,000) because it also has perfected a security interest in the sold
