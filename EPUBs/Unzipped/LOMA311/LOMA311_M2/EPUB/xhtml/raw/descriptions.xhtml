                    <p>Let’s take a look at a simple negotiation for repairs. Ms. Sakamoto is
                        an independent agent, and Mr. Linkwater is an electrician.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ms. Sakamoto:</strong> “The light fixture in my office is not working
                        properly, and I think it should cost about $200 to repair it.”</p>
                    <p>Offer? No. This statement does not include any definite terms and does
                        not indicate that Ms. Sakamoto intends to enter into an agreement with
                        Mr. Linkwater.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ms. Sakamoto:</strong> “How much would you charge to repair the
                        light fixture in my office?”</p>
                    <p>Offer? No. This statement is a request—known as an <em>invitation</em>—for
                        Mr. Linkwater to make an offer to Ms. Sakamoto.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ms. Sakamoto:</strong> “I will pay you $200 to repair the light
                        fixture in my office.”</p>
                    <p>Offer? Yes. This statement includes a promise to pay a definite amount,
                        and indicates that Ms. Sakamoto would like to enter into an agreement on
                        her stated terms. The terms of the contract are sufficiently definite that
                        a resulting contract can be enforced.</p>

                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>Let’s look at the conversation about office repair again.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ms. Sakamoto:</strong> “I will pay you $200 to repair the light
                        fixture in my office.”</p>
                    <p>Because Ms. Sakamoto made a valid offer, she is the offeror and Mr. Linkwater
                        is the offeree.</p>
                    <p><strong>Mr. Linkwater:</strong> “That seems a little low. I have to charge
                        $250.”</p>
                    <p>A counteroffer terminates the original offer, because it constitutes a
                        rejection of the offer.</p>
                    <p>When an offeree makes a counteroffer, the process of forming a contract
                        begins again.</p>
                    <p>The parties, however, switch roles.</p>
                    <p>Thus, a counteroffer is an offer. The party who makes the counteroffer
                        becomes the offeror, and the party to whom the counteroffer is made is
                        the offeree.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ms. Sakamoto:</strong> “All right, $250 sounds fair.”</p>

                <div class="inner-content">
                    <p>Let’s look at some examples of types of acceptance.</p>
                    <p><strong>Written acceptance</strong> is the most preferred type of acceptance
                        in civil law jurisdictions. Acceptance in written form limits misunderstandings
                        regarding the terms of the agreement.</p>
                    <p>Signatures on a contract generally establish a presumption of mutual assent,
                        in either a paper hardcopy or electronic format.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example: </strong>A furniture store advertised, “All couches on
                        sale for $199 each. Acceptance must be made in writing before 7:00 p.m.
                        on Friday.”</p>
                    <p>If a customer accepts that offer in writing before 7:00 p.m. on Friday,
                        he will have accepted the store’s offer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Oral acceptance</strong> also is a valid form of acceptance in
                        civil law jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> One person tells his neighbor, “I’d like to buy
                        your old lawnmower, and I can pay $100.” His neighbor responded, “That
                        sounds fair. I’ll bring the mower over to your house.” The neighbor verbally
                        accepted the initial offer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Acceptance by conduct</strong> is generally recognized in civil
                        law jurisdictions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> A German student visited China but could not
                        speak Mandarin.</p>
                    <p>She went to a supermarket, took an item, and placed it on the counter
                        in front of the cashier. The cashier totaled the price of the item and
                        accepted the student’s payment.</p>
                    <p>The cashier, thus, accepted the offer to purchase the items by the student’s
                        conduct.</p>
                    <p>An acceptance made orally or in writing is known as an <strong>express acceptance</strong>.</p>
                    <p>An acceptance by conduct is said to be an <strong>implied acceptance</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Like common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions allow the offeror
                        to specify the manner in which the offer must be accepted.</p>
