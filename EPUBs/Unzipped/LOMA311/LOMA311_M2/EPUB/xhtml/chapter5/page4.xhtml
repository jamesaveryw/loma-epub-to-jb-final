            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-73">The terms of the agreement between a principal and agent determine the
                parties’ rights and duties. In addition, the common law imposes a number
                of duties on agents. By authorizing an agent to act on her behalf, a principal
                places her trust in the agent. Thus, the agent is a fiduciary, who must
                meet her fiduciary duties. Figure 5.1 summarizes the agent’s duties to
                the principal.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch5-h3-4">Loyalty and Good Faith</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-75">An agent who acts in a fiduciary capacity owes a duty of undivided loyalty
                and good faith to the principal. This duty requires an agent acting within
                the scope of his authority to act primarily for the principal’s benefit.
                The agent, therefore, must put the interests of the principal above all
                other interests, including the agent’s own interests.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch5-p-76">An agent’s duty of loyalty and good faith requires the agent to provide
                the principal with all material information that relates to the principal’s
                business. In addition, an agent may not engage in any business that interferes
                with or competes with the principal’s business. In some circumstances,
                however, an agent may have a financial interest in a transaction that involves
                the principal. In such a case, the agent has a duty to fully disclose all
                material facts to the principal. The agent may deal on his own behalf in
                such a transaction only when the principal, with full knowledge of the
                material facts, consents to the transaction.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-77">The duty of loyalty and good faith prohibits an agent from making secret
                profits from the agency relationship. An agent also may not receive secret
                commissions or other undisclosed payments from third parties. An agent
                who receives undisclosed profits from the agency relationship must turn
                over those profits to the principal.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch5-h3-5">Obedience</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-78">An agent has a duty to obey the principal’s instructions. Because an agent
                is acting for the principal, the agent must carry out her duties according
                to the principal’s wishes. An agent, however, has no duty to obey instructions
                that are unlawful or unreasonable. For example, if an agent would be physically
                endangered by following the principal’s instructions, the agent has no
                duty to follow the instructions. When an agent commits an unlawful act
                on the instructions of the principal, as a general rule both the agent
                and the principal are liable for the unlawful act.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch5-h3-6">Competence</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-79">An agent has a duty to use reasonable care, skill, and diligence in carrying
                out her agency duties. The level of care required of an agent is that of
                a reasonably prudent person who has the same skills as the agent. Thus,
                an agent must use the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person with
                the same skills would use in the same or similar circumstances. An agent
                who fails to use reasonable care in carrying out her agency duties has
                breached a fiduciary duty owed to the principal.</p>
            <div class="clearfix"
            id="loma311-ch5-div-31">&#160;</div>
            <h3 id="loma311-ch5-h3-7">Accounting</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-80">An agent has a duty to account to the principal for all money that comes
                into the agent’s possession as a result of the agency relationship. An
                agent must account to the principal within a reasonable time after receiving
                money, as well as when the agency relationship terminates. An agent must
                also keep proper records. Additionally, most states and other common law
                jurisdictions require that the principal’s money be kept in an account
                separate from the agent’s money.</p>
            <div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch5-div-32">&#160;</div>
            <h3 id="loma311-ch5-h3-8">Principal’s Remedies</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-81">An agent who fails to carry out the terms of the agency agreement is in
                breach of the agreement. For example, if an agent exceeds his actual authority
                and binds the principal to a contract with a third party, the agent has
                breached the agency agreement. Similarly, if an agent fails to carry out
                a fiduciary duty owed to the principal, the principal generally may consider
                the failure to be a breach of the agency agreement.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-82">An agent’s breach of the agency agreement provides the principal with
                legal justification for terminating the agency relationship. In addition,
                such a breach gives the principal the right to recover damages for the
                losses that resulted from the breach.</p>
