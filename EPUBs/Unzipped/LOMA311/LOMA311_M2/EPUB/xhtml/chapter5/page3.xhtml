            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-45">An agency relationship can take many forms. Here are a few examples of
                some familiar transactions that may involve agency relationship:</p>
            <ul
            class="list" id="loma311-ch5-ul-9">
                <li id="loma311-ch5-li-39">
                    <p id="loma311-ch5-p-46"><em>Real estate transactions</em>. A person selects a real estate agent
                        to represent him in the sale or purchase of a home.</p>

                <li id="loma311-ch5-li-40">

                        to purchase stock on her behalf.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch5-li-41">
                    <p id="loma311-ch5-p-48"><em>Contract negotiations</em>. An athlete chooses an agent to represent

                </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-49">An agent may hold broad authority to act on behalf of the principal. Conversely,
                    an agency relationship may be created for a limited purpose or for one
                    specified transaction. Agency relationships also can vary in duration.
                    An agency relationship may be ongoing, or it may be created for a stated
                    period of time. The scope of an agent’s authority and the duration of the
                    agency relationship often depend on the type of transactions involved.
                    For example, the agency relationship for the real estate transaction described
                    above would likely be for one specified transaction and would end after
                    a specified period of time. Conversely, in the agency relationship for
                    the financial services transactions described above, the stockbroker might
                    hold broad authority to purchase stock on the investor’s behalf on an ongoing
                    basis.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-50">Typically, an agency relationship is created by an agreement between the
                    principal and agent. As part of an agency agreement, the principal confers
                    actual authority on the agent. <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-actualauthority"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch5-span-13" role="doc-glossref">Actual authority</span> is
                    the authority to act on behalf of the principal that the principal intentionally
                    confers on the agent and that the agent reasonably believes is conferred.
                    Actual authority can be either express or implied.</p>

                            or <em>incidental authority</em>, is the authority that a principal intends

                            authority. Implied authority is included with express authority. It gives
                            an agent the authority to do all the other acts that are reasonably necessary
                            to carry out her express duties.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-56">As a general rule, a principal may do anything through an agent that the
                    principal can legally do for himself. Some acts, however, are of such a
                    personal nature that they cannot be delegated to an agent. For example,
                    an individual cannot make a statement under oath through an agent. The
                    law requires individuals to perform such an act themselves.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch5-p-57">The scope of an agent’s actual authority is a question of fact. The courts
                    typically use an objective test to determine the scope of that authority.
                    In applying this objective test, the trier of fact must determine what
                    authority a reasonable person in the position of the agent would understand
                    the principal to have conferred on the agent.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-58">No formalities are required to create an agency relationship. The parties
                    generally may consent either orally or in writing. Some agency agreements,
                    however, must be in writing to be enforceable. For example, the Statute
                    of Frauds requires an agency agreement that is to last for more than one
                    year to be in writing in order to be enforceable by the courts.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-60">When an agent acts within the scope of her authority, the agent’s acts
                    typically are considered to be the acts of the principal. Likewise, when
                    an agent, acting within the scope of her authority, enters into a contract,
                    the contract is binding on the principal.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-61">Another basic rule of agency law is that knowledge of the agent is knowledge
                    of the principal. In other words, while the agent is carrying out the principal’s
                    business, any knowledge the agent gains typically is considered knowledge
                    the principal has gained as well. The principal is deemed to have this
                    information regardless of whether the agent actually communicates it to
                    the principal.</p>

                            of an agent for the insurer. If the policyowner discloses information relevant
                            to the policy, this information is considered to be knowledge that the
                            insurer has gained even if the customer service representative did not
                            document the information.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-64">The legal effect of a contract entered into by an agent on behalf of the
                    principal may vary based on the contractual capacity of the parties.</p>

                    <h4 id="loma311-ch5-h4-1">Contractual Capacity of the Principal</h4>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-65">As noted above, when an agent enters into a contract, the contract generally
                        is binding on the principal. However, the legal effect of a contract entered
                        into by an agent on behalf of the principal depends in part on the contractual
                        capacity of the principal. For a contract entered into by an agent to be
                        valid and binding on the principal, the principal must have contractual
                        capacity. For example, if a minor appoints an agent who enters into a contract
                        for non-necessaries on the minor’s behalf, the contract is voidable by
                        the minor. Likewise, a principal who has been judicially declared insane
                        lacks contractual capacity. Any contracts that an agent tries to create
                        on behalf of such a principal generally are void.</p>
                    <div class="clearfix"
                    id="loma311-ch5-div-17">&#160;</div>
                    <h4 id="loma311-ch5-h4-2">Contractual Capacity of the Agent</h4>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-66">An agent who enters into a contract on his principal’s behalf is not a
                        party to that contract. Thus, the agent generally does not need to have
                        contractual capacity to form a contract that binds the principal. In appointing
                        an agent, however, the principal assumes the risks of being represented
                        by the agent. For example, if a competent principal appoints a minor as
                        her agent, any contract the minor enters into within the scope of his authority
                        as an agent is binding on the principal. Because the agent is a minor,
                        however, the agency agreement between the agent and principal is voidable
                        by the minor.</p>
