            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-115">When an agent acts on behalf of a principal in dealings with a third party,
                legal issues sometimes arise between the principal and the third party.
                In this section we describe some of these issues.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-116">Whether a principal is bound to a contract made by an agent depends on
                whether the principal was disclosed, partially disclosed, or undisclosed.
                Also relevant is whether the agent was acting within the scope of his actual
                or apparent authority. These concepts are discussed below.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-117">When an agent enters into a contract with a third party on behalf of a
                named principal, the principal is known as a <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-disclosedprincipal"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch5-span-35" role="doc-glossref">disclosed principal</span>.
                When the named parties to a contract are the disclosed principal and the
                third party, the principal is liable under the contract.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch5-p-118">Occasionally, an agent contracts in her own name with a third party on
                behalf of a partially disclosed or an undisclosed principal.</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch5-p-119">When an agent contracts on behalf of a principal but does not identify
                        the principal in the contract, the principal is known as a <span class="gt"

                        the agent discloses that he is acting on behalf of a principal, but the
                        principal is not named as a party to the contract. For example, a person
                        appoints an agent to bid on her behalf at an art auction, and the agent
                        reveals he is acting on behalf of another person whose name he does not
                        reveal.</p>

                        role="doc-glossref">undisclosed principal</span>. For example, a large,
                        well-known corporation appoints an agent to make offers to purchase multiple
                        tracts of land from several different sellers. If the sellers knew that
                        this corporation was making the offers, the sellers might raise their asking
                        price. Therefore, the corporation instructs the agent not to disclose that
                        she is acting on behalf of another party.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-121">In the above cases, the third party may enforce the contract against the
                partially disclosed or undisclosed principal. The principal may enforce
                the contract against the third party <em>only</em> if the agent acted within
                the scope of her actual authority.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-122">An agent’s authority to bind the principal may be actual authority or
                apparent authority. We described an agent’s <em>actual authority</em> earlier
                in the chapter. <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-apparentauthority" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma311-ch5-span-38" role="doc-glossref">Apparent authority</span> is
                authority that is not expressly conferred on an agent, or not implicitly
                included with that express authority, but is authority that the principal
                either intentionally or negligently allows a third party to believe the
                agent possesses. In the case of both actual and apparent authority, the
                principal is bound by the agent’s act. An agent is deemed to have had apparent
                authority when (1) the principal allows the third party to reasonably believe
                that the agent has authority to bind the principal and (2) the third party
                relies on the appearance of that authority.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-123">An agent’s apparent authority is created by intentional or negligent acts
                of the principal. Although it is sometimes difficult for a third party
                to know the scope of an agent’s actual authority, third parties must act
                reasonably and prudently to protect themselves. A third party, therefore,
                cannot rely solely on the appearances created by an agent and has a duty
                to use reasonable care to determine the scope of the agent’s actual authority.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-124">Whether an agent had actual or apparent authority to bind a principal
                is a question of fact. The third party bears the burden of proving that
                the agent had actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the principal.
                While actual authority is created by a principal’s representations to an <em>agent</em>,
                apparent authority is created by a principal’s actions or representations
                to a <em>third party</em>. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-representation"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch5-span-39" role="doc-glossref">representation</span> is
                a statement made by a contracting party that is influential in inducing
                the other party to enter the contract.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-125">Most common law jurisdictions require a showing of the following three
                    elements to prove apparent authority:</p>

                        the principal may reject or accept the contract. The principal accepts
                        such a contract by ratifying the agent’s unauthorized actions. <span class="gt"

                                Employers must comply with the applicable jurisdiction’s employment laws.
                                If an agent is considered an employee under a given employment law, the
                                principal-agent relationship must comply with that law. In addition, whether
                                an agent acted in a given situation as an employee or an independent contractor
                                determines the extent of a principal’s vicarious liability.</p>

                                id="loma311-ch5-span-44" role="doc-glossref">Vicarious liability</span> is
                                indirect liability. As a general rule, every person is responsible for
                                his own acts. Thus, all individuals are personally liable for the torts
                                they commit. Generally, an employer has no vicarious liability for the
                                torts of an independent contractor. In contrast, when an employee commits
                                a tort in the course of employment, the employer also is liable for the
                                tort. In other words, the employer is vicariously liable for the harm that
                                resulted from the tort even though the employer may not have been directly
                                at fault. Thus, from a legal standpoint, the actions of many employees
                                in a life insurance company can have an impact on the company. As we saw
                                in Chapter 1, an effective compliance and ethics program along with a strong
                                corporate culture provides important safeguards against such liability.

                                        known as <em>respondeat superior</em>, which means “let the master answer.”
                                        Although employees are personally liable for their own torts, they often
                                        do not have the financial resources to compensate people they injure. In
                                        addition, because the employer profits from the employee’s employment,
                                        the employer is liable to a third party who is injured as a result of that
                                        employment.</p>

                                        of legal hurdles in winning a lawsuit against the wrongdoer’s employer.
                                        First, the employer generally will have vicarious liability only if the
                                        wrongdoer was its employee. If the individual was an employee, the injured
                                        party also must prove that when the injury occurred, the wrongdoer was
                                        acting within the course of his employment.</p>
