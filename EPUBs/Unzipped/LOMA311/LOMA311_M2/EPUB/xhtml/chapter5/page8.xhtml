            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-188">When an agency relationship terminates, the agent’s actual authority to
                bind the principal ends. In some cases, however, an agent continues to
                have apparent authority to bind the principal even after the agency relationship
                terminates. An agency relationship can terminate by</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-193">The method by which an agency relationship terminates affects the rights
                and liabilities of the principal, the agent, and any third parties who
                then deal with the agent.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-194">Note that termination of an agency relationship must be distinguished
                from termination of an employment relationship. Employment relationships
                are governed by federal and state laws, such as those described in Chapter
                3. Thus, termination of an agency relationship when the agent is an employee
                is governed by both employment law and agency law.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch5-h3-18">Termination by Act of a Party</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-195">Because agency is a relationship requiring the consent of both parties,
                either party has the power to end the relationship at any time. A party,
                however, may have the <em>power</em> to end the relationship but not the <em>legal right</em> to
                do so. For example, assume that a principal and an agent enter into an
                agency agreement that is for a term of one year. Either party has the power
                to end the relationship at any time during that year, but neither has the
                legal right to do so without the other’s consent. A party who ends an agency
                relationship without the legal right to do so is in breach of the agency
                agreement and is liable to the other party for any damages that result
                from the breach.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-196">As we have noted, if an agent breaches a fiduciary duty, the principal
                has the right to terminate the agency relationship without having further
                liability to the agent. Similarly, when an agent has the legal right to
                terminate the agency relationship, the agent may do so without having further
                liability to the principal. For example, an agent typically has a legal
                right to end the agency relationship when the principal fails to compensate
                the agent per the terms of the agency agreement.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-197">An agent and a principal have the legal right to agree to end the agency
                relationship at any time without incurring further legal liability to each
                other. This is true whether the agency agreement included a termination
                provision or not. As long as both parties agree, they have the legal right
                to end their relationship at any time and on any terms they desire.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-198">Many agency agreements state that they are to continue until a specified
                    date or until a specified purpose is accomplished. When an agency agreement
                    contains a termination provision, the agreement terminates upon the occurrence
                    of the condition specified. Neither party has a duty to notify the other
                    party of the termination or to take any action for the termination to be
                    effective. When an agency agreement has been performed, the parties have
                    no further liabilities or duties to each other.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-199">When an agency agreement does not have a termination provision, the relationship
                    terminates after a reasonable time. What constitutes a reasonable time
                    is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances surrounding the
                    agency relationship. An agency relationship that is to continue for an
                    unspecified amount of time is known as an <span class="gt" data-term="ch5-gt-agencyatwill"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch5-span-67" role="doc-glossref">agency at will</span>.
                    Either the principal or agent has the legal right to terminate an agency
                    at will at any time and for any reason by giving the other party notice
                    of termination of the relationship. If the amount of notice required is
                    not stated in the agency agreement, the terminating party must give a reasonable
                    amount of notice. The amount of time that constitutes reasonable notice
                    is a question of fact that may be affected by a number of factors, such
                    as the customs and trade practices of the industry.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-200">The occurrence of certain events results in the termination of an agency
                    relationship by operation of law. Termination by operation of law means
                    that an agent’s authority to bind the principal automatically terminates
                    as a result of the operation of law rather than as the result of an action
                    of the agent or of the principal. Following are some of the events that
                    terminate an agency relationship by operation of law:</p>

                            its subject matter is gone.</p>

                            agreement and the agent loses her license, then the agent has lost the
                            capacity to perform the agency agreement.</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-205">Upon the occurrence of such an event, the agency relationship is terminated
                    by operation of law. The acts of the agent are no longer binding on the

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-206">A principal’s duty to notify third parties of the termination of an agency
                    relationship depends on the reason for termination.</p>

                <h4 id="loma311-ch5-h4-5">Termination by Operation of Law</h4>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-207">When an agency relationship terminates by operation of law, the agent’s
                    authority—actual and apparent—to bind the principal also terminates by
                    operation of law. Because the agent’s authority automatically terminates
                    in such cases, the principal generally has no duty to notify third parties
                    of the termination. A third party who contracted with an agent on behalf
                    of a principal after the agency terminated by operation of law cannot enforce
                    the contract against the principal. Likewise, the principal cannot enforce
                    the contract against the third party. The third party’s only recourse is
                    against the agent. In this case, the agent may be held liable for breach
                    of the warranty of authority because the agent acted on the principal's
                    behalf when there was no longer an agency relationship.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch5-p-208">When an agency relationship terminates for reasons other than by operation
                    of law, the agent may continue to have apparent authority even though her
                    actual authority to bind the principal has ended. Because apparent authority
                    is created by the principal’s actions, such authority continues until the
                    principal takes action to revoke it. Any third party who is unaware that
                    the agency relationship ended and who enters into a contract with the agent
                    on behalf of the principal can enforce the contract against the principal.
                    Therefore, the principal must take steps to revoke the agent’s apparent
                    authority by providing notice that the agent’s authority has ended. Such
                    notice must be made to third parties who dealt with the agent during the
                    agency relationship.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch5-p-209">The principal also must take whatever steps are reasonable to notify third
                    parties who did not deal with the agent but who knew of the agency relationship.
                    What steps are reasonable is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances
