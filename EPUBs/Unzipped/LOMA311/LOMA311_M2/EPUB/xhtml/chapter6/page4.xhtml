            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-34">Ownership of property means that the owner has a bundle of rights in the
                property, and the law recognizes and protects those rights. This bundle
                of ownership rights generally includes:</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-37">For example, assume that you own a pickup truck. Your ownership of the
                truck includes the exclusive right to enjoy and use the truck: to drive
                it, allow a family member to borrow it, use the truck to make deliveries
                for pay, and so on. Your ownership also includes the right to dispose of
                the truck, by bequeathing it, giving it away, or selling it on whatever
                terms you choose. You can also use the truck as security for a loan by
                giving a creditor a security interest in the truck. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-securityinterest"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-11" role="doc-glossref">security interest</span> is
                a claim against a debtor’s property that gives a creditor the right to
                possession of the property if the debtor defaults on the underlying loan.
                In the event of a default, the property can be sold to satisfy the outstanding
                debt. We discuss security interests in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-38">A person often acquires ownership of property by buying it from the party
                    who owns it. We typically refer to the party who sells the property as
                    the <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-transferor" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma311-ch6-span-12" role="doc-glossref">transferor</span>, and the
                    party who buys the property is the <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-transferee"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-13" role="doc-glossref">transferee</span>.
                    In any transfer of property ownership, the new owner generally can receive
                    only those ownership interests that the prior owner had to transfer.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-39">Sometimes a person receives property as a <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-gift"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-14" role="doc-glossref">gift</span>,
                    which is a voluntary transfer of property ownership from one person to
                    another without the exchange of consideration. The person who makes a gift
                    is known as the <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-donor" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma311-ch6-span-15" role="doc-glossref">donor</span>, and the person
                    to whom a gift is made is known as the <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-donee"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-16" role="doc-glossref">donee</span>.
                    State laws typically require that the following three elements be present
                    to complete a valid gift:</p>
                    <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch6-ul-11">

                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-40">The donor must intend to make a gift.</p>

                        a person generally has the right to all that his property produces and
                        all that is added to or united with the property. The owner of land usually
                        owns the crops that grow on the land or anything beneath the land, and
                        the owner of a fixed annuity owns any interest that the annuity earns in
                        addition to the principal.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-44">Property can be lost, abandoned, or stolen. In these cases, determining
                        who has the right to claim title to the property can be difficult. In this

                        id="loma311-ch6-span-18" role="doc-glossref">title</span> is a person’s
                        claim to ownership of property that is superior to anyone else’s ownership
                        claim. The following general rules govern abandoned and lost property:</p>

                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-45">When someone <em>abandons</em> property and no longer intends to possess
                                it, whoever claims the property becomes the owner.</p>

                                it, that person continues to own the property. Anyone who finds the property
                                has the right to keep it until the rightful owner is located. The finder
                                in such a case has a superior claim to the property over anyone other than
                                the rightful owner.</p>

                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-47">When someone receives or buys property that was <em>stolen</em>, the transferee
                                receives no title because the transferor did not have title to transfer.
                                Such goods remain the property of the rightful owner.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-48">To protect buyers from unscrupulous practices, sometimes the common law
                            grants a buyer more rights and better title in property than the seller
                            possessed. For example, a <em>good faith purchaser for value</em> generally
                            takes property free of any unknown lien or interest in the property held
                            by another party. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-lien" epub:type="glossref"
                            id="loma311-ch6-span-19" role="doc-glossref">lien</span> is a generic term
                            used to describe a claim against property resulting from a debt or other
                            obligation. The law protects the good faith purchaser from unknowingly
                            losing property to a claim that the seller did not fairly reveal. Two elements
                            are necessary for a buyer to qualify as a good faith purchaser for value:</p>

                                    example, if a buyer could have discovered such an interest by exercising
                                    reasonable care, then the buyer does not qualify as a good faith purchaser.</p>

                                        Ms. Veluz gave Mr. Drake a lien on a piece of property she owned. Mr. Drake
                                        never filed the lien against the property in the county lands return office.
                                        Ms. Veluz later sold the property to Anna Murphy. Because Ms. Murphy was
                                        a good faith purchaser for value, Mr. Drake’s lien on the property terminated.
                                        Although Mr. Drake may seek repayment of the loan from Ms. Veluz, he has
                                        no claim against the property after Ms. Veluz sold the property to a good

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-57">A few states have enacted community property laws that govern property
                                ownership between spouses. In a community property state, the law treats
                                a married couple as a community. <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-communityproperty"

                                certain property owned by a married couple in which each spouse has an
                                undivided half interest. For example, assume that a husband is employed
                                outside the home and the wife stays home to raise the children. The income
                                the husband earns during the marriage is community property. Any property
                                that the couple buys with community property during the marriage, such
                                as a house and automobiles, becomes community property also.</p>

                                transfer any or all of those rights to others. For example, when a property
                                owner uses the property as collateral for a loan, he gives the creditor
                                an interest in the property. We discuss the rights of creditors further
