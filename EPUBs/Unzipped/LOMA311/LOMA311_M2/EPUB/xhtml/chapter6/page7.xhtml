            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch6-h2-8">The Uniform Commercial Code</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-140">General business law concerns itself not only with property law but also
                with commercial transactions. Commercial transactions are interactions
                in which two or more parties exchange something of value—not just goods
                or other forms of property, but also services—for some type of remuneration.
                Many types of commercial transactions take place across jurisdictional
                lines, especially as improvements in communications technology make such
                transactions easier than ever. To create uniformity in transactions of
                this nature, all states have enacted statutes based on the <span class="gt"
                data-term="ch6-gt-uniformcommercialcode" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-67"
                role="doc-glossref">Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)</span>, which is a model
                law created by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of
                Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to govern commercial transactions.
                The UCC is divided into the following nine articles:</p>
            <ul class="list"
            id="loma311-ch6-ul-19">
                <li id="loma311-ch6-li-68">
                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-141"><strong>Article 1</strong> contains definitions of commercial law terms
                        and general rules of construction that apply to transactions under most
                        of the provisions of the UCC.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch6-li-69">
                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-142"><strong>Article 2</strong> governs contracts for the sale of goods, or
                        tangible personal property.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch6-li-70">
                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-143"><strong>Article 3</strong> governs negotiable instruments.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch6-li-71">
                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-144"><strong>Article 4</strong> governs bank collections of checks and drafts.</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-145"><strong>Article 5</strong> governs letters of credit.</p>

                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-146"><strong>Article 6</strong> governs bulk sales, such as the sale of the
                        entire inventory of a business.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch6-li-74">
                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-147"><strong>Article 7</strong> governs domestic documents of title, such as
                        contracts for the delivery and storage of goods.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch6-li-75">
                    <p id="loma311-ch6-p-148"><strong>Article 8</strong> governs transactions in investment securities.</p>

            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-150">Many of the contracts and transactions governed by the UCC are beyond
                the scope of this text. Here we focus on Article 2, which covers sale of
                goods, and Article 3, which covers negotiable instruments.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch6-h3-8">Sale of Goods</h3>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-151">In the course of doing business, insurers purchase tangible property such
                as office furniture, office supplies, telephones, and computers. Therefore,
                a portion of an insurer’s operations is governed by Article 2 of the UCC,
                which pertains to contracts for the sale of goods. By <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-saleofgoods"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-68" role="doc-glossref">sale of goods</span>,
                we mean the transfer of ownership of tangible personal property in exchange
                for some other property, money, or services.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-152">In the United States, Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the sale
                of goods, but it does <em>not</em> apply to contracts involving the sale
                of services, real estate, or intangible property (such as stock certificates,
                bonds, or insurance policies). The sale of such property is governed by
                general contract law principles, other articles of the UCC, or other state
                and federal laws. Under Article 2, parties generally are free to contract
                on whatever terms they choose and in whatever manner they choose. However,
                the UCC does provide some limits. For example, the courts will not enforce
                contract terms that are grossly unfair or one-sided.</p>
