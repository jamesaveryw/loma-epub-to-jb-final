                after a property owner’s death. Many financial products, such as stocks,

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-81">An important right of property ownership is the owner’s right to decide
                who will receive the property when the owner dies. An individual who dies
                is referred to as a <em>decedent</em>. A decedent’s <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-estate"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-34" role="doc-glossref">estate</span> includes
                all of the property that the individual owned at her death. Ownership of
                some property in that estate automatically passes by operation of law or
                contract. For example, when two people own property jointly with a right
                of survivorship, then upon one person’s death, ownership passes automatically
                to the surviving joint owner. If any property owned by a decedent does
                not pass at her death automatically by operation of law or contract, that

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-82">A person can determine who will receive the property in his probate estate
                    by executing a <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-will" epub:type="glossref"
                    id="loma311-ch6-span-36" role="doc-glossref">will</span>, which is a legal
                    document that directs how the person’s property is to be distributed after
                    his death. The term <em>will</em> once referred to the document governing
                    the decedent’s real property, while the term <em>testament</em> referred
                    to the document governing the decedent’s personal property. A will is still
                    sometimes called the last will and testament for this reason. The person
                    who makes a will is known as the <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-testator"

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-83">The types of wills and the formalities required for wills vary from country
                    to country. In the United States, laws in each state set out the requirements
                    that must be met in order for a will to be valid. Typically, a person’s
                    will must be executed—signed—in accordance with the requirements of the
                    applicable laws in the state in which the person is domiciled. A person’s

                            and is of sound mind has testamentary capacity. For purposes of making
                            a will, a person is considered to be of sound mind if she (1) understands
                            the nature and character of the property she owns, (2) understands that
                            she is making a will, and (3) recognizes the people who would be expected
                            to be provided for in her will.</p>

                        <p id="loma311-ch6-p-87">The will must be signed by the testator or by someone else who signs on
                            behalf of the testator, at the testator’s direction, and in the testator’s

                            or must attest to the witnesses that it is her signature. Witnesses generally
                            are competent if they have attained a specified age, usually 18, and if
                            they are disinterested parties who are not beneficiaries of the will.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-90">Because a will does not become effective until the testator’s death, a
                        testator may revoke a will at any time before her death. For example, a
                        testator may revoke a will by executing a subsequent valid will. A testator
                        may also revise a valid will by executing a <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-codicil"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-41" role="doc-glossref">codicil</span>,
                        which is a testamentary document that supplements a will. Because it is
                        a testamentary document, a codicil must be executed with the same formalities
                        that are required to execute a valid will. A testator can use a codicil
                        to add to the provisions of a will, to revoke or alter provisions, and
                        to explain or qualify provisions. For example, a testator may use a codicil
                        to dispose of property she acquired after she executed her will.</p>

                            Intestate succession laws in each state specify the individuals who are
                            entitled to the probate estate of individuals who die intestate. In addition,
                            if a person dies testate but fails to dispose of all of his property in
                            a valid will, then the remaining property is distributed in accordance
                            with the intestate succession law. For conflict of laws purposes, the distribution
                            of an intestate’s real property is governed by the laws of the state in
                            which the property is located. The distribution of an intestate’s personal
                            property is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the person
                            was domiciled at the time of his death.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-92">Most countries have intestate succession laws, which provide that property
                            passes to a person’s close family members—including surviving spouse, children
                            and other descendants, and parents—in a specified order of priority. For
                            example, in the United States, most states have adopted laws based on the
                            Uniform Probate Code. The purpose of intestate succession laws is to distribute
                            the intestate’s property in a manner that closely represents how the average
                            person would have passed on his property had that person created a will.
                            However, these laws are inflexible, and they vary greatly from jurisdiction
                            to jurisdiction. As a result, an intestate’s property often is not passed
                            on as the person would have wished.</p>

                                Typically, the probate court that has authority to oversee the probate
                                of a will is the probate court of the jurisdiction in which the decedent
                                was domiciled at the time of her death.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-94">In each case, the court appoints a <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-personalrepresentative"

                                an intestate decedent, the personal representative is appointed by the

                                the decedent’s estate. The personal representative is responsible for collecting
                                and completing an inventory of the decedent’s property. The representative
                                is also responsible for filing any required income tax returns, collecting
                                all debts owed to the decedent, and paying all outstanding debts owed by
                                the decedent. The personal representative then distributes any remaining
                                property to the people who are determined by the probate court to be entitled
                                to it in accordance with either the terms of the decedent’s will or the
