                    is a product of the human intellect and in which the creator has ownership
                    rights. Individuals and businesses that express ideas in some tangible
                    or artistic form have specific ownership rights in that intellectual property.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-102">Advances in communication technology have made it easier than ever before
                to violate, however accidentally, a business’ or person’s intellectual
                property rights. For example, a person can electronically copy the text
                from a work in a matter of seconds and present that work as her own. A
                company must be careful in its many communications to avoid using someone
                else’s intellectual property. Therefore, a company must be aware of the
                laws that protect the ownership rights specific to intellectual property.
                Such laws generally include copyright laws, patent laws, and trademark
                laws.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-103">Generally, an insurance company’s products do not qualify for intellectual
                    property rights. However, an insurance company typically owns many types
                    of intellectual property, such as images or a company logo. Some unique
                    devices, computer applications, or other business methods may also qualify
                    as intellectual property.</p>

                    to the author or originator of an original literary or artistic work and
                    that gives the copyright holder the exclusive right to publish, produce,
                    or perform the right for a specified time. Copyrights are granted for works
                    such as books, fine and graphic arts, music, records, photography, software,
                    video, cinema, and choreography.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-105">In the United States, copyrights are governed by federal law, which provides
                    that copyright protection attaches to a work when it is first created.
                    For works created after January 1, 1978, an author or originator has copyright
                    protection in the work for his lifetime and for 70 years thereafter. Figure
                    6.1 gives some examples of the length of copyright protection—including
                    the duration of the author’s life—in other countries. In each case, a copyright
                    granted under a given jurisdiction’s laws is enforceable only within that
                    jurisdiction. Thus, for example, an author who publishes a novel in the
                    United States and several other countries is granted a separate copyright
                    in each country.</p>

                    author or originator does not need to take special action to protect the
                    work. Copyright holders typically include a copyright notice on their works
                    to notify others of the copyright. Holders are permitted, but not required,
                    to register their copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office at any time

                    to the inventor or creator of an original process, machine, manufactured
                    article, or chemical compound. In the United States, the federal government
                    has authority to issue patents, and federal laws specify the requirements
                    that an invention must meet to receive a patent. Unlike copyrights, which
                    attach upon the creation of a work, a patent is effective only after the
                    applicable government agency acts on an application for a patent. Because
                    U.S. law recognizes that business methods may be patented, some insurers
                    do file for U.S. patents. For example, an insurance company can file for
                    a patent for a unique method for calculating and making distributions for
                    a variable annuity.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-115">To get a U.S. patent, an inventor must file an application with the U.S.
                    Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The information provided in the application
                    should demonstrate in detail that the invention meets the requirements
                    for a patent. For example, an invention must be something new, which means
                    that it must add to existing knowledge. Obtaining a patent is an expensive
                    and time-consuming process that usually takes several years.</p>

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-120">U.S. federal patent laws approach the issue somewhat differently. Only

                                an inventor may assign ownership of the patent to another party. A business
                                that employs an inventor typically obtains ownership of patent rights in
                                an invention when the individual inventor assigns ownership of those rights

                    other patents already exist that would affect the patentability of the
                    invention. The search helps the applicant decide whether it is likely that

                        company trademarks is its company logo.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-126">In the United States, individuals and businesses may use any mark they
                        choose to identify the source of their goods and services, as long as it
                        does not infringe another’s mark. By using a mark to identify goods or
                        services, a person or business establishes property rights in the mark.
                        To further protect their property rights in a mark, however, individuals
                        and businesses generally register their marks with the USPTO.</p>

                    id="loma311-ch6-p-127">A person who wants to register a mark must file an application with the
                        USPTO, which evaluates the information in the application to determine
                        whether the applicant meets the statutory requirements for registering
                        a mark. The primary consideration is whether the mark is so similar to
                        an existing mark that it is likely to cause confusion as to the source
                        of the goods or services. If confusion is likely, the USPTO rejects the
                        application. The following insight illustrates some of the advantages of
                        registering a mark in the United States.</p>

                        for 10 years. Registrations can be renewed for additional 10-year periods
                        by paying the applicable fee and filing with the USPTO an affidavit attesting
                        to the registrant’s continuing use of the mark.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-131">A person who claims rights in a mark can use the TM (trademark) or SM
                        (service mark) designation to alert the public to her claim, regardless
                        of whether she has filed an application with the USPTO. After a mark has
                        been registered, the registrant can give notice to others of its ownership
                        claim by displaying with the mark the words <em>Registered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</em>,
                        or <em>Reg U.S. Pat. &amp; Tm. Off</em>., or the letter R enclosed within
                        a circle: ®.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-132">A mark is infringed when someone, without the consent of the mark’s owner,
                        uses a copy or imitation of a mark to sell, distribute, or advertise a
                        product or service and such use is likely to cause confusion, cause a mistake,
                        or deceive the public. If the mark has been registered, the registrant
                        may file a lawsuit in federal court and may be entitled to an injunction
                        to prevent further use of the infringing mark. If the infringing acts were
                        committed with knowledge that use of the imitation is likely to cause confusion,
                        mistake, or deception, then the registrant is entitled to recover money
                        damages.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-133">The owner of a trademark or service mark must be vigilant to protect that
                        property. Owners can lose the exclusive right to use a trademark or service
                        mark if a challenger successfully shows that the term has become generic,
                        and considered by the public to represent the product rather than the producer.
                        For that reason, many companies will require the identifiers TM, SM, or
                        ® on each usage. Most companies provide templates for various forms, letterheads,
                        presentations, and other types of communication so that the company’s employees
                        can help identify and protect the company’s trademarked intellectual property.</p>
