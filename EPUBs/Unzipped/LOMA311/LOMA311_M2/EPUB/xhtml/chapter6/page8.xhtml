            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-153">Commerce and trade require the transfer of money from buyers to sellers.
                Because trade often crosses state and national borders, individuals and
                businesses need to be able to complete transactions without having to pay
                cash. For example, it would be unreasonable for an insurer to ask a customer
                in another state to pay her premiums in cash. Negotiable instruments are
                a substitute for cash. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-negotiableinstrument"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-69" role="doc-glossref">negotiable instrument</span> is
                a written document that represents an unconditional promise or order to
                pay a specified amount of money upon the demand of the owner of the instrument.

                role="doc-glossref">Negotiability</span>means that possession of an instrument can be transferred—or
                    negotiated—from person to person, and the instrument generally is accepted
                    as a substitute for cash. A negotiable instrument’s two forms are as follows:</p>

                    (2) the instrument is payable to the person or “to bearer.” For example,
                    if you have possession of a check that is payable to another person, you
                    do not qualify as the holder of the instrument and cannot negotiate it.
                    We describe instruments payable “to bearer” later in this section.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-159">To be negotiable, an instrument must meet four basic requirements:</p>
                    <ul
                    class="list" id="loma311-ch6-ul-21">
                        <li id="loma311-ch6-li-79">
                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-160">First, <em>the instrument must be in writing and must be signed by its maker</em>.
                                The document may be handwritten, typed, or printed, and the signature may
                                be handwritten, typed, or stamped on to the writing. As a general rule,
                                any type of signature is acceptable as long as it shows the maker’s intent
                                to validate the instrument. In addition, the signature must be that of
                                the maker or someone authorized to sign on the maker’s behalf. For example,
                                businesses authorize specific individuals to sign negotiable instruments,
                                such as checks, on their behalf.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch6-li-80">
                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-161">Second, <em>the instrument must contain an unconditional promise to pay or an unconditional order to pay</em>.
                                A note stating “I owe you $100” is not negotiable because it does not include
                                a promise to pay the amount owed. Likewise, a note that says “I promise
                                to pay you $100 if you repair my garage door” is not negotiable because
                                the promise to pay is not unconditional.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch6-li-81">
                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-162">Third, <em>the amount promised or ordered to be paid must be a fixed amount of money</em>.
                                This requirement is met whether the instrument is payable with or without
                                interest. If the principal amount owed is clearly stated, the amount of
                                interest payable may be stated as a fixed or variable amount or rate.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch6-li-82">
                            <p id="loma311-ch6-p-163">Fourth, <em>the instrument must be payable on demand or at a definite time</em>.
                                If an instrument does not state when it is payable, then it is payable
                                on demand. A check, for example, typically is payable whenever the payee
                                chooses to present it for payment; thus, a check is negotiable. A note
                                that is dated and states on its face that it is payable “30 days after
                                date” is payable at a definite time and, thus, is negotiable. By contrast,
                                an instrument that is payable “30 days after my death” is not negotiable
                                because the date of the person’s death is not known. Thus, the instrument
                                is not payable at a definite time.</p>
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-164">As a general rule, negotiable instruments must be “payable to bearer”
                            or “payable to order.” An instrument that is payable to bearer, known as
                            <span

                            role="doc-glossref">bearer paper</span>, is negotiable by the holder without having to be
                                signed by a specific payee. A signed check that is payable “to cash” is
                                considered to be payable to the bearer who can negotiate it simply by transferring
                                its possession to another person.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-165">An instrument that is payable to the order of a specific payee, known
                            as <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-orderpaper" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-80"
                            role="doc-glossref">order paper</span>, can be negotiated if it is indorsed—that
                            is, signed on the back of the document—by the named payee and transferred
                            to another. For example, a check that is “payable to the order of Jane
                            Villard” is negotiable if Ms. Villard indorses the check and gives it to
                            another person. Checks typically are payable to the order of a specific
                            payee.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-166">An instrument that is payable to a named person without specifically stating
                            that it is “payable to the order of” the person is not negotiable. To return
                            to the previous example, assume that when she indorsed her check, Jane
                            Villard wrote “pay to Eduardo Guerrero” on the check. The check is now
                            payable only to Mr. Guerrero. Because Mr. Guerrero cannot transfer the
                            check to another person, it is no longer a negotiable instrument.</p>

                                        contains contradictory terms. In the United States, Article 3 of the UCC
                                        states the following rules:</p>
                                    <ul id="loma311-ch6-ul-22">
                                        <li id="loma311-ch6-li-83">Typewritten terms prevail over printed terms.</li>

                                                Because the UCC provides that words prevail over numbers, the check is
                                                payable for $45.</p>

                                        Because the reliable flow of commerce is vital to a country’s economy,
                                        many countries have enacted laws that make it a criminal offense to write

                                                one year in prison with fines up to double the amount of the check. Under
                                                Indian law, if a check is dishonored, a payee must give notice in writing
                                                to the drawer of the check demanding payment for the amount of the check.
                                                The drawer then has 15 days after receipt of the notice to honor the check.
                                                If he fails to do so, he is subject to criminal, as well as civil, penalties.
                                                Providing proper notice to the drawer of a dishonored check is important
                                                because only a drawer who has been given such notice can be held liable.</p>

                                use the more formal term <em>indorsement</em>.</p>

                                        can indorse the check and give it to someone else as payment for an amount

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-181">As noted earlier, a holder typically indorses an instrument by signing
                                the instrument on the back. The signature generally must match the holder’s
                                name as it appears on the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two
                                or more people jointly, then all of the named people must sign the instrument
                                in order to negotiate it. Thus, an instrument made payable to “John and
                                Jane Doe” must be signed by both John and Jane. By contrast, an instrument
                                made payable to “John or Jane Doe” may be negotiated if it is indorsed
                                by either John or Jane. When an instrument is made payable to a firm or
                                organization, any individual authorized to act on behalf of the named firm
                                or organization may indorse the instrument.</p>

                                can be negotiated. The following are some of the various ways that an instrument
                                can be indorsed in the United States:</p>

                                        date. Retailer Y agreed to pay for the goods in a lump sum when it received
                                        all of the goods. Manufacturer X then assigned the right to collect under
                                        the contract to Supplier A. When Supplier A delivered all of the goods,
                                        Retailer Y refused to pay for the goods because they were defective. As

                                        the note to Supplier B, which became a <em>holder in due course</em>. Because
                                        Supplier B is a holder in due course, Retailer Y is obligated to pay the

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-202">The maker of a negotiable instrument is contractually liable under the
                                instrument. Anyone who signs a negotiable instrument becomes contractually
                                liable to pay the instrument. A person’s liability, however, varies depending
                                on the capacity in which she signed the instrument and on whether the instrument
                                was a note or a draft. The following parties have primary liability to
                                pay a negotiable instrument:</p>
                            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch6-ul-27">

                                        if you sign a note, you have assumed primary liability to pay the note.</p>

                                        A draft is accepted when the drawee signs it and thus agrees to pay it.</p>

                                        then the bank will accept the check, note its acceptance by signing the
                                        front of the check, and pay the stated amount to the holder. If the account
                                        does not have sufficient funds to pay the check, the bank will not accept
                                        the check. By accepting a check, the bank becomes liable to pay the stated

                                to pay it. The maker of a draft has secondary liability—after the drawee—for
                                payment of the draft. If the drawee accepts the draft, then the maker’s
                                liability is extinguished. However, if the drawee does not accept the draft,
                                then the maker remains liable to pay the draft.</p>

                                        will refuse to accept the check, and Ms. Griffin will remain liable to

                                        transferred it to the Magnitude Bank, which held it until it came due.
                                        If Mr. Edwards does not pay the note when it comes due, then the creditor

                                    makes the instrument nonnegotiable. However, people do not always detect
                                    a forged signature. If a person transfers a negotiable instrument without
                                    detecting such a forgery, does that person possess liability?</p>

                                id="loma311-ch6-p-217">Article 3 of the UCC contains rules for determining who has liability
                                    under a negotiable instrument in cases of forgery or other actions to wrongfully
                                    collect on a negotiable instrument. The UCC typically places the liability
                                    for such a loss on the party who was in the best position to prevent the
                                    loss. For example, a bank generally is liable if it accepts a check with
                                    a forged signature or indorsement. Banks are required to take reasonable
                                    precautions to verify signatures and are liable for the loss if they fail
                                    to take such precautions. The following are some exceptions to that general
                                    rule:</p>

                                    is liable for any losses that result from the alteration. For example,
                                    assume that the maker writes a check for $1,000, but he wrote it so that
                                    the payer was able to alter it to read “One thousand five hundred” by adding
                                    “five hundred” after the “one thousand.” As a general rule, the maker will
