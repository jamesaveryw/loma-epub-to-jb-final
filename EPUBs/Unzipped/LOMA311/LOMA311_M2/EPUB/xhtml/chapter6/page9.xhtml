            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-243">Individuals and businesses commonly purchase goods and services and agree
                to pay for them at a later date. Most jurisdictions throughout the world
                have established legal rules to govern the operation of various types of
                credit transactions. Credit transactions can be either unsecured or secured.</p>

                        a credit transaction in which a creditor extends credit and receives only
                        the debtor’s promise to pay the debt. Should a debtor fail to repay an
                        unsecured debt, the creditor must sue the debtor and obtain a judgment
                        to recover the unpaid amount.</p>

                        a credit transaction in which a creditor extends credit and receives a
                        security interest in the debtor’s property as a way to guarantee that the
                        creditor will be protected if the debtor defaults on the loan. For example,
                        customers frequently purchase automobiles by means of a secured transaction
                        in which the debtor agrees to repay the borrowed amount, plus interest.
                        The creditor obtains a security interest in the purchased vehicle and can
                        repossess the vehicle if the creditor fails to repay the loan. A creditor
                        who obtains a security interest in a debtor’s property is referred to as
                        a <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-securedparty" epub:type="glossref"

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-246">The rules governing security interests vary depending on the type of property
                    involved in the transaction. Security interests in real property are beyond
                    the scope of this text; here we describe security interests in personal
                    property. As a general rule, the laws of the state where the personal property
                    is located govern the operation of security interest in that property.
                    In the United States, Article 9 of the UCC governs security interest in
                    personal property.</p>

                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-247">In order to gain the full benefits and protections of a security interest,
                    the secured party must comply with all requirements of the applicable state
                    laws. Two basic requirements generally must be met to gain a security interest
                    in personal property: (1) the interest must be attached to specific property
                    and (2) the interest must be perfected.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-248">The security interest must <em>attach</em> to specified property so that
                    it is clear to anyone who is interested that the property is subject to
                    a security interest. In order for a security interest to attach to specific
                    property, the following requirements must be met:</p>

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-252"><em>Perfecting</em> an interest is a matter of taking additional steps
                    to protect a security interest against claims from third parties. Requirements
                    for perfecting an interest vary somewhat from state to state, and also
                    vary depending on the type of property that is attached. The primary methods
                    of perfecting a security interest are perfecting by (1) the filing of a
                    financing statement, (2) taking possession of property, and (3) operation
                    of law.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-253">Filing a financing statement is the most common method of perfecting a
                    security interest. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-financingstatement"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-111" role="doc-glossref">financing statement</span> is
                    a document that is filed with a specified state or local government official
                    to record the existence of a security interest in identified property of
                    a debtor. In some states, the secretary of state is the administrative
                    official who is responsible for handling such document filings. In many
                    states, local governments are responsible for handling filings concerning
                    personal property. The financing statement, which must be signed by the
                    debtor, contains the names and addresses of the debtor and creditor and
                    a description or other identification of the property that has been attached
                    to secure the debt.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-254">The states have established administrative systems to handle financing
                    statements filings. The filings become part of the public record, and anyone
                    can search the records to determine whether a given piece of property is
                    subject to a security interest. Thus, these filings serve as notice to
                    the public of property that is subject to a security interest.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch6-p-255">A financing statement filing is valid for a specified period of time,
                    typically five years. If a debt has not been repaid at the end of the specified
                    period of time and the secured party wants to continue its security interest,
                    the secured party can file a <span class="gt" data-term="ch6-gt-continuationstatement"
                    epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch6-span-112" role="doc-glossref">continuation statement</span>,
                    which amends the initial financing statement and continues the effectiveness
                    of that financing statement for a specified number of years. The secured
                    party can file additional continuation statements as necessary. A

                        no longer has a security interest in the debtor’s property.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch6-p-256">A secured party can perfect a security interest in certain types of property
                    by taking possession of the property that serves as collateral for a debt.
                    Typically, a secured party perfects a security interest in negotiable instruments
                    and money by taking possession of the collateral property. A secured party
                    also can take possession of goods and thereby perfect a security interest
                    in the goods. In such cases, possession serves as notice to third parties
                    of the security interest.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch6-p-257">For certain limited types of collateral, a security interest is perfected
                    by operation of law when the security interest attaches to the property.
                    For example, when a consumer borrows money to purchase consumer goods and
                    the creditor takes a security interest in those goods, the security interest
                    is perfected automatically when the interest attaches to the goods.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch6-p-258">When a security interest has been perfected in identified property, both
                        the debtor and the secured party have rights in the property. Typically,
                        the debtor has the right to possess and use the property. If the debtor
                        sells or otherwise disposes of the property, the creditor’s security interest
                        nevertheless continues in the property. Thus, the creditor continues to
                        have a perfected security interest and its rights are protected.</p>

                                a neighbor. Because Gleaming Bank had perfected its security interest in
                                the equipment, the bank’s security interest in the equipment continues

                            a public or private sale. The proceeds from the sale of the property go
                            to pay the expenses incurred in the foreclosure proceeding and to satisfy
                            the debtor’s obligation to the creditor. If any proceeds remain, they may
                            be used to pay other creditors that have a security interest in the property.
                            When several creditors have a security interest in the same property, the
                            order in which they perfected their security interests determines which

                                    and gave the bank a security interest in some of its machinery. Precedent
                                    perfected its security interest on January 20. On April 1, Fullbore borrowed
                                    money from Cygnet Bank and gave Cygnet a security interest in the same
                                    machinery. Cygnet Bank perfected its security interest on April 10. When
                                    Fullbore defaulted on both loans, it owed $5,000 to Precedent Bank and
                                    $2,500 to Cygnet Bank. Precedent Bank foreclosed on the machinery, which
                                    it sold for $6,000, and incurred costs of $200 in the foreclosure proceedings.
                                    Because Precedent Bank perfected its security interest first, it has priority
                                    over Cygnet Bank. Thus, Precedent Bank is entitled to recoup the $5,000
