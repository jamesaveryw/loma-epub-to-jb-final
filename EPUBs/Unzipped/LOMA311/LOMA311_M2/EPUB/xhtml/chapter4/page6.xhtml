            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-201">Most contracts are carried out with few problems. But when a dispute arises,
                the parties may resort to the courts. A breach of contract that results
                in damage to the innocent party gives the innocent party a cause of action
                against the breaching party. When a lawsuit is filed concerning a contract
                breach, the defendant may have any number of legal defenses to the lawsuit.
                For example, if any requirement for the formation of a contract was not
                met, the defendant has a legal defense to the lawsuit. In cases where the
                defendant lacked the necessary legal capacity to enter into a contract,
                the contract is void or voidable by the defendant and the plaintiff’s action
                for breach of contract will fail. Other defenses to the formation of a
                contract include duress, undue influence, misrepresentation, and fraud.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-202">For a contract to be valid, all parties must freely enter into the contract.
                Therefore, if one party enters a contract under duress, the contract generally
                is voidable by that party. <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-duress" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma311-ch4-span-98" role="doc-glossref">Duress</span> exists when a
                person acts wrongfully or threateningly to overpower the will of another
                so as to force that person to enter into a contract against her own free
                will. Duress can take a number of forms, such as threats or physical or
                mental coercion. When a person enters into a contract under duress such
                that a reasonable person would have been compelled to enter into the contract
                against her will, then the contract generally is voidable by that person.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-203">Similarly, a contract created by the use of undue influence is voidable
                    by the party who was the subject of the undue influence. <span class="gt"
                    data-term="ch4-gt-undueinfluence" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch4-span-99"
                    role="doc-glossref">Undue influence</span> is the misuse of a position of
                    power or trust to overcome the free will of another person. For example,
                    a party may—because of weakness, trust, or dependence—unreasonably rely
                    on the advice of another. The potential for undue influence exists in relationships
                    between lawyer and client, doctor and patient, guardian and ward, and parent
                    and child. The stronger party exerts undue influence by using his position
                    to persuade the weaker party to act for the benefit of the stronger party
                    rather than the weaker party.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-204">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-misrepresentation" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma311-ch4-span-100" role="doc-glossref">misrepresentation</span> is
                        an untrue statement of fact. As a general rule, when one party makes a
                        <span
                        class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-materialmisrepresentation" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma311-ch4-span-101" role="doc-glossref">material misrepresentation</span>—that is, a misrepresentation that induces
                            the other party to enter into a contract that it would not have entered
                            had it known the truth—the contract is voidable by the innocent party.
                            Such a contract is voidable whether the person making the misrepresentation
                            did so knowingly or in the belief that their untrue statement of fact was
                            true. Material misrepresentation is an important defense for insurers because
                            they must be able to rely on representations of fact provided by applicants
                            for insurance. This reliance on accurate representations of fact has given
                            rise to the concept of utmost good faith, as described in the insight below.
                            We discuss material misrepresentation in more detail in Chapter 13.</p>

                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-207">From the insurer’s perspective, the need to receive accurate and truthful
                                information from a proposed insured is very important. The concept of <em>utmost good faith</em> (or <em>uberrima fides</em>)
                                means that all parties entering into an insurance contract must deal in
                                good faith, meaning in an open and fair manner. For example, a person applying
                                for life insurance must disclose all relevant information concerning his
                                health, activities, and other risk factors.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-208">By contrast, some other types of contract are governed by the principle
                                of <em>caveat emptor</em>, or “let the buyer beware.” This principle historically
                                governed many contracts for the sale of real property. In effect, caveat
                                emptor states that the buyer assumes the risk that a purchase may not meet
                                the buyer’s expectations. The buyer has the responsibility of reasonably
                                examining the item to be purchased before the purchase is completed. In
                                recent years, consumer protection laws have reduced the number of contracts
                                governed by the caveat emptor principle. Today, caveat emptor applies largely
                                to goods and property that are sold “as is,” or that otherwise come with
                                no guarantee or warranty.</p>
