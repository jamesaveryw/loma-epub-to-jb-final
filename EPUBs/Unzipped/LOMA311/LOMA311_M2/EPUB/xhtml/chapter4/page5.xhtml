            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-78">The principles of contract law within each jurisdiction determine the
                legal status of contracts governed by the jurisdiction’s laws. Such principles
                determine whether a given contract is legally enforceable and who has the
                right to enforce the contract. In describing the legal status of a contract,
                we often use the terms <em>valid</em>, <em>void</em>, and <em>voidable</em>.</p>

                        id="loma311-ch4-span-36" role="doc-glossref">void contract</span> is an
                        agreement that was never enforceable by law. The term <em>void contract</em> is
                        actually a contradiction in terms because it implies that a contract of
                        some kind exists. Even when two parties form an agreement, if the agreement
                        is not legally enforceable, then legally the parties did not create a contract.
                        An agreement to carry out an illegal action is an example of a void contract.</p>

                        grounds to reject, or <em>avoid</em> the contract. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-voidablecontract"
                        epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch4-span-37" role="doc-glossref">voidable contract</span> is
                        one in which a party has the right to avoid her obligations under the contract

                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-82">What specific factors can make a contract void or voidable? Each jurisdiction
                    sets specific requirements that the contracting parties must meet to create
                    a valid contract. According to the common law rules in most of the United
                    States, the formation of a valid informal contract involves four general
                    requirements:</p>
                <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch4-ul-8">
                    <li id="loma311-ch4-li-37">
                        <p id="loma311-ch4-p-83">The parties to the contract must mutually assent (agree) to the terms
                            of the contract.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="loma311-ch4-li-38">
                        <p id="loma311-ch4-p-84">The parties must exchange legally adequate consideration.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="loma311-ch4-li-39">
                        <p id="loma311-ch4-p-85">The parties must have contractual capacity.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="loma311-ch4-li-40">
                        <p id="loma311-ch4-p-86">The contract must be for a lawful purpose.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-87">If any one of these requirements is not present, then one or all of the
                    parties to the contract may have legal grounds to assert that the contract
                    is not enforceable by law. Here we examine each of these requirements in
                    detail.</p>

                <h3 id="loma311-ch4-h3-6">Mutual Assent</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-88">The requirement of mutual assent is sometimes described as a requirement
                    that the parties reach a “meeting of the minds” concerning the terms of
                    their agreement. In order to mutually assent to a contract, all of the
                    parties must intend to be bound by the contract’s terms. In order to prove
                    an intention to be bound, each party must make some outward expression
                    of that intent.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-89">Whether a party intended to be bound by the terms of a contract is a question
                    of fact. Because outside parties cannot determine a party’s subjective
                    intent, the U.S. courts apply the reasonable person standard to determine
                    whether the parties mutually assented to the terms of a contract.</p>

                    <div class="inner" id="loma311-ch4-div-48">
                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-91">Justin Yuen alleges that Maria Cruz breached their contract. Ms. Cruz
                            maintains that she did not intend to be bound to a contract, and that she
                            was joking when she agreed to the contract’s terms. Thus, she maintains
                            that no contract was created. In the civil trial, the trier of fact must
                            look at Ms. Cruz’s actions and decide whether a reasonable person in Mr.
                            Yuen’s position would have understood that Ms. Cruz assented and intended
                            to be bound to a contract with Mr. Yuen. If the trier of fact determines
                            that Mr. Yuen had no reason to believe that Ms. Cruz was joking when she
                            agreed to the contract’s terms, then the court is likely to find that the
                            parties created a valid contract.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-92">The typical form of demonstrating mutual assent is for one party to make
                        an offer, which the other party accepts. Thus, the required elements of
                        mutual assent are an <em>offer</em> and an <em>acceptance</em>.</p>

                        role="doc-glossref">offer</span> is a proposal that, if accepted by another
                        according to its terms, constitutes a binding contract. The party who makes
                        an offer is the <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-offeror" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma311-ch4-span-39" role="doc-glossref">offeror</span>. The party
                        to whom the offer is made is the <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-offeree"

                    <p
                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-94">An offer to contract must be definite. An offer is definite when it indicates
                        that the offeror intends to be legally bound if the offeree accepts the
                        offer. The offered terms must be definite enough that any resulting contract
                        can be enforced. Because parties often negotiate before entering into a
                        binding contract, it is critical to distinguish between negotiating and
                        making a definite offer. Watch Video 4.1 to see the differences between
                        negotiations and a definite offer.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-97">Whether one party has made a definite offer is a question of fact. Courts
                            in common law jurisdictions generally apply the reasonable person standard
                            to the facts of a given situation to determine whether one party made an
                            offer to contract. The trier of fact must decide whether a reasonable person
                            in the offeree’s position would have understood that the other party made
                            a definite offer to contract.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-98">An offer must be definite, but an offer also is effective only if it is
                            communicated to the offeree. An offer may be communicated</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-101">In order to accept an offer, the offeree must know of the offer. Thus,
                            the offeree must actually receive the offer. For example, if a person mails
                            an offer to a second person, the offer is not considered to have been made
                            until the second person actually receives the offer.</p>

                        id="loma311-ch4-p-102">Offers do not remain valid indefinitely. When an offer terminates, the
                            offeree loses the ability to accept the offer. An offer can terminate in
                            several ways.</p>
                        <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch4-ul-10">
                            <li id="loma311-ch4-li-50">
                                <p id="loma311-ch4-p-103">First, an offer can lapse. The offeror controls the offer and has the
                                    right to specify the length of time during which the offer will remain
                                    open. If the offeree does not accept the offer within the specified time,
                                    the offer terminates—or <em>lapses</em>—at the end of the specified time.
                                    If the offeror does not specify a time limit, an offer is considered to
                                    remain open for a reasonable length of time. What constitutes a reasonable
                                    time is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the particular
                                    situation. The subject matter of the transaction, the manner in which an
                                    offer was communicated, and customs and trade practices may be relevant
                                    to determining what a reasonable time may be. For example, an offer to
                                    buy perishable goods, communicated by telephone, probably implies that
                                    an immediate reply is requested. Conversely, an offer to buy imperishable
                                    goods, communicated by physical mail, does not imply that an immediate
                                    reply is expected.</p>

                                <p id="loma311-ch4-p-104">Most offers are <em>revocable</em>, meaning the offeror can withdraw or
                                    revoke an offer at any time before it has been accepted. When the offeror
                                    revokes an offer, the offer terminates and the offeree can no longer accept
                                    the offer. An offer generally is revocable unless the offeror made a legally
                                    enforceable promise to keep the offer open for a specified time.</p>

                                <p id="loma311-ch4-p-105">An offer also terminates if the offeree rejects the offer in whole or
                                    in part. Once an offeree has rejected an offer, the offeree cannot later
                                    accept that offer unless the offeror agrees to reopen the offer. This rule
                                    is necessary to protect the offeror, whose circumstances may have changed
                                    by the time the offeree attempts to accept an offer that has already terminated.</p>

                                    cannot later accept the offer unless Mr. Tan agrees to reopen that offer.
                                    After Ms. Cork rejected the offer, Mr. Tan may have made another investment
                                    or the market value of Ms. Cork’s stock may have changed. It would be unfair
                                    to allow Ms. Cork to accept the offer after she had rejected it.</p>

                            cannot enter into an enforceable contract. We discuss the requirement of

                            jurisdictions is the principle of freedom of contract. According to the
                            principle of <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-freedomofcontract" epub:type="glossref"
                            id="loma311-ch4-span-57" role="doc-glossref">freedom of contract</span>,
                            parties have the right to contract with whomever they choose and on whatever
                            lawful terms they choose. The offeror controls the offer and has the right
                            to decide with whom he will contract. In any given situation, therefore,
                            the terms of the offer determine the identity of the offeree. The offeree
                            is that person or persons to whom the offeror intended to make an offer.
                            Generally, only the offeree can accept an offer.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-114">The offeree can accept an offer in a variety of ways, depending on the
                            circumstances of the situation. Typically, the nature of the offer controls
                            how the offeree must accept in order to create a contract. When an offeror
                            makes an offer to enter into a bilateral contract, the offeror makes a
                            promise and in exchange seeks a promise from the offeree. To create a contract,
                            the offeree’s acceptance must be in the form of a written or oral promise
                            indicating that the offeree intends to be bound. Figure 4.2 illustrates
                            a bilateral contract.</p>

                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-116">When an offeror makes an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, the
                            offeror makes a promise and in return seeks the performance of an act,
                            such as the payment of money. The offeree can accept the offer and create
                            a contract by performing the requested act. The acceptance of an offer
                            to enter into a unilateral contract, therefore, typically consists of conduct
                            rather than words. Figure 4.3 illustrates a unilateral contract.</p>

                                    outward expression of that intent. For example, when the parties put their
                                    agreement into writing, they generally all sign the document to show that
                                    they intend to be bound to the contract. As a general rule, the offeree’s
                                    silence—that is, failure to reject an offer—does not constitute an acceptance.</p>

                                            of the offer. It is impossible to determine whether she intends to accept

                                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-141">Courts in common law jurisdictions typically are not concerned with the
                                            actual value of the consideration received for a contract. Instead, the
                                            courts generally leave it to the parties to make their own agreement on
                                            the terms they choose, even if the value of the consideration is minimal.
                                            In England, for example, some contracts require a “peppercorn” of consideration,
                                            which might be a very small sum of money. A few contracts even ask for
                                            a literal peppercorn as payment.</p>
                                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-142">According to general contract law, consideration can consist of either
                                            a promise or an act. Mutual promises, such as those exchanged in a bilateral
                                            contract, generally are adequate consideration for each other. Similarly,
                                            the performance of an act in exchange for a promise is adequate consideration
                                            to support a valid unilateral contract. For example, the act requested
                                            in exchange for a promise often is the payment of a specified amount of
                                            money.</p>

                                                States now have made 18 the age of majority. In those states, contracts
                                                entered into by 18-year-olds of sound mind are valid and binding on both
                                                parties. Figure 4.4 lists the age of majority in some other countries.</p>

                                                    are voidable by the minor. Thus, a minor can enforce a contract against
                                                    the other party to the contract, but the other party cannot enforce the
                                                    contract against the minor. This rule protects minors against those who
                                                    would take advantage of a minor’s innocence or lack of experience.</p>

                                                    parties often are hesitant to contract with minors. But it is sometimes
                                                    in a minor’s best interest to contract with a competent party. Therefore,
                                                    the common law provides some exceptions to the general rule that a minor’s
                                                    contracts are voidable by the minor. One of the primary common law exceptions
                                                    states that a contract for necessaries is not voidable by a minor.

                                                        person actually requires to sustain her well-being. Whether specific goods
                                                        and services are necessaries is a question of fact that must be answered
                                                        on a case-by-case basis. For example, a court typically considers food,
                                                        clothing, lodging, and medical attention to be necessaries, unless the
                                                        minor does not actually need them. Thus, if a minor lives with his parents,
                                                        and they provide him with food and clothing, a contract a minor enters
                                                        into to purchase food or clothing probably is not a contract for necessaries.
                                                        Although a minor may not avoid a contract for necessaries, the minor is
                                                        required to pay only the reasonable value of such necessaries. Thus, if
                                                        the contract price is greater than the reasonable value of the necessaries,
                                                        the minor cannot be forced to pay the full contract price.</p>
