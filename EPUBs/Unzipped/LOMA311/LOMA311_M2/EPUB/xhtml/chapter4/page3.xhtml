            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-29">In the United States and many other common law jurisdictions, the courts
                have developed a body of common law, known as <em>case law</em>, to govern
                contracts. Case law includes general principles and rules that govern the
                formation and legal effect of contracts.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-30">Over time, legislatures have modified the common law principles by enacting
                statutes that apply to specific types of financial services contracts,
                such as insurance contracts. In Chapter 10, we describe how such statutes
                modify the general rules of contract law.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-31">In the United States, the state governments are responsible for enacting
                laws that govern most contracts. Thus, each state has created its own body
                of contract law that generally applies to contracts entered into within
                that state. The basic features of these state laws, however, are fairly
                uniform and are found in the laws of many other common law jurisdictions.</p>

                <h3 id="loma311-ch4-h3-1">Conflict of Law Rules for Contracts</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-32">When the laws of more than one jurisdiction apply to a contract, conflict
                    of law rules determine which jurisdiction’s laws take precedence. According
                    to the general rules of contract law, the parties to a contract are allowed
                    to mutually decide which jurisdiction’s laws will govern their contract.
                    In a written contract, this right usually takes the form of a <span class="gt"
                    data-term="ch4-gt-choiceoflawsprovision" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch4-span-8"
                    role="doc-glossref">choice of laws provision</span>. A choice of laws provision
                    usually specifies a jurisdiction with which at least one party has a connection.
                    In individual life insurance, state law may specify that this jurisdiction
                    is the state in which the policy is issued or delivered, which is generally
                    the state of residence of the insured at the time of purchase. This jurisdiction
                    is sometimes referred to as the <em>situs</em> of the contract. Courts typically
                    apply the laws of the place designated by the parties and referred to in
                    the contract.</p>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-33">If the parties did not specify which jurisdiction’s laws are to govern
                    their contract, the governing laws are determined depending on the parties’
                    location:</p>
                <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch4-ul-6">
                    <li id="loma311-ch4-li-32">
                        <p id="loma311-ch4-p-34"><em>All contracting parties are in the same jurisdiction</em>. The laws
                            of that jurisdiction generally govern the contract.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li id="loma311-ch4-li-33">
                        <p id="loma311-ch4-p-35"><em>The contracting parties are in more than one jurisdiction</em>. The
                            conflict of law rules adopted by the affected jurisdictions determine which
                            jurisdiction’s laws govern the contract.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-36">Many U.S. states and other common law jurisdictions follow the traditional
                    common law rule, which states that a contract is governed by the law of
                    the place where the contract was created. Typically, the contract is created
                    in the place where the last act to create the contract was completed. In
                    the United States, the last acts necessary to complete the formation of
                    a life insurance contract are (1) payment of the initial premium and (2)
                    delivery of the policy to the policyowner. Thus, a life insurance contract
                    typically is considered created in the state in which the policy is delivered
                    or the initial premium is paid, whichever occurs later. Generally, the
                    law that governs a life insurance contract when it is issued continues
                    to govern for the life of the contract.</p>

                            Emily’s payment of the first premium in State B on October 3. The contract
                            was delivered to Emily in State A on October 4. According to the traditional
                            common law rule, the laws of State A govern the insurance contract.</p>

                            in State A, but the contract was to be performed entirely in State B by
                            workers who reside in State B. Following the center of gravity rule, a
                            court could find that the law of State B governs the contract because State
                            B has a greater interest in the contract than does State A.</p>
