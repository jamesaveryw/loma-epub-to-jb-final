            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-224">As a general rule, informal contracts may be entirely oral, partly oral
                and partly written, or entirely written. Unless a statute requires an informal
                contract to be in writing, an oral informal contract is valid. However,
                contracting parties often seek to protect their interests by putting their
                agreements in writing. A written agreement provides evidence that the contract
                exists and evidence as to the terms of the contract. If a lawsuit concerns
                an oral contract, the parties have the often difficult task of proving
                that a contract was formed and proving the terms of the contract. If there
                is no written evidence of the contract, the court must base its decision
                solely on the conflicting testimony of the parties to the contract.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-225">A number of statutes require certain kinds of contracts to be in writing,
                such as insurance contracts. Most U.S. states and other common law jurisdictions
                have enacted some form of the common law Statute of Frauds. The <span class="gt"
                data-term="ch4-gt-statuteoffrauds" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch4-span-107"
                role="doc-glossref">Statute of Frauds</span> is a law that declares certain
                types of contracts to be unenforceable unless they are evidenced by a written
                document signed by the party to be charged with performing the contract.</p>

                        <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-227">Terrence Hugo filed a lawsuit in which he alleges that Camille Lexington
                            breached their contract. The contract is governed by the Statute of Frauds.
                            Mr. Hugo must provide evidence in the form of a written document that contains
                            the contract’s terms and that is signed by Ms. Lexington. If Mr. Hugo cannot
                            produce such evidence, then the Statute of Frauds provides Ms. Lexington
                            with a legal defense to the lawsuit, and the contract will be unenforceable.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-228">The Statute of Frauds typically governs the following types of contracts,
                        which must be in writing to be enforceable:</p>

                            <p id="loma311-ch4-p-232">A contract concerning an interest in land.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p id="loma311-ch4-p-233">An agreement that cannot be performed according to its terms within one
                                year after the contract is completed. If it is at all possible for the
                                parties to perform a contract within one year, then the contract is not
                                subject to the Statute of Frauds and need not be in writing to be enforceable.
                                Insurance contracts generally can be performed within one year, and therefore
                                the Statute of Frauds does not require them to be in writing. By contrast,
                                an agreement to enter into a partnership to last for 10 years cannot be
                                performed according to its terms within one year and must be in writing
                                in order to be enforceable.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-234">The statute’s requirement of a written document usually is met if the
                        plaintiff in a lawsuit produces a writing that contains the essential terms
                        of the agreement. This writing must be signed by the party to be charged
                        with performing the contract—that is, the defendant. The other party need
                        not have signed the document. In addition, the writing may consist of more
                        than one document as long as the documents refer to each other and are
                        clearly connected with one transaction.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-235">Keep in mind that the Statute of Frauds is only one law that may require
                        a specific type of contract to be in writing. Many states or other common
                        law jurisdictions require certain types of contracts, such as insurance
                        policies, to be in writing even though the Statute of Frauds does not require
                        the same. Figure 4.5 lists several types of agreements for which states
                        and other common law jurisdictions have imposed a writing requirement.</p>
