            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-209">A contract is performed when each party has satisfactorily carried out
                her contractual obligations. For example, a contract for the sale of goods
                is performed when the goods have been delivered to the buyer, who pays
                for the goods in full. When a party carries out her obligations, she is
                discharged and has no further obligations under the contract. Contracting
                parties can also be discharged in the following situations:</p>
            <ul class="list"

                <li id="loma311-ch4-li-76">
                    <p id="loma311-ch4-p-210">The parties can discharge a contract by mutual agreement.</p>

                        in which one party agrees to accept something other than what he was entitled
                        to receive under the original contract.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch4-li-78">
                    <p id="loma311-ch4-p-212">A party can waive his right to require another party’s performance of
                        a contract. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-waiver" epub:type="glossref"
                        id="loma311-ch4-span-103" role="doc-glossref">waiver</span> is the voluntary
                        relinquishment of a known right. Such a waiver discharges the other party’s
                        obligation to perform the contract.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-213">As a general rule, a breach of contract may be a <em>minor breach</em> or
                a <em>substantial breach</em>. After a minor breach, the contract typically
                remains valid and enforceable. Parties continue to have a duty to perform
                their remaining contractual obligations. The innocent party, however, may
                have the right to have the breach remedied.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-215">Charles Nash entered into a contract with the TUV Construction Company.
                        TUV agreed to build a house for Mr. Nash, for which he agreed to pay a
                        specified amount. TUV completed the house but failed to install a kitchen
                        oven in accordance with the terms of the contract. TUV substantially performed
                        its part of the contract by building the house, so Mr. Nash is required
                        to pay TUV the purchase price. However, Mr. Nash also has the right to
                        have the breach remedied. TUV must either install the oven or be liable
                        for the damages that result from its failure to install the oven. The amount
                        of these damages would include, for example, the cost of having someone
                        else install the oven.</p>

            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-216">By contrast, when one party substantially breaches a contract, the innocent
                party has two possible courses of action. She can affirm the contract and
                treat it as if it were valid and binding. Alternatively, the innocent party
                can treat the contract as if it were terminated. This option excuses her
                from performing any remaining contractual obligations. In addition, the
                innocent party has a right to a remedy for the damages that resulted from
                the breach.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-217">Whether a contract has been performed and whether a party has breached
                a contract are questions of fact. In deciding such questions of fact, the
                courts are likely to consider all of the circumstances surrounding the
                transaction. For example, the trier of fact will consider whether the innocent
                party received the benefit he bargained for and the extent to which the
                breaching party performed the contract.</p>
