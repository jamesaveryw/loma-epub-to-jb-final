            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch4-h2-11">Parol Evidence Rule</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch4-p-251">As noted in Chapter 2, the parties to a lawsuit must prove their side
                of a lawsuit by producing evidence. The courts have developed procedural
                rules that govern the evidence that may be produced at trial. One such
                procedural rule, known as the <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-parolevidencerule"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch4-span-111" role="doc-glossref">parol evidence rule</span>,
                states that parol evidence is <em>not</em> admissible to add to, vary, or
                contradict the terms of a written contract. <span class="gt" data-term="ch4-gt-parolevidence"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch4-span-112" role="doc-glossref">Parol evidence</span> is
                evidence that is extrinsic to—that is, outside of—an unambiguous written
                agreement. Parol evidence may be oral evidence, such as the testimony of
                witnesses concerning the negotiations leading up to the contract, or it
                may be written evidence, such as letters or memoranda.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch4-p-252">The common law courts developed the parol evidence rule to allow contracting
                parties to rely on the certainty of a written contract. With this rule
                in force, one party cannot subsequently try to change the terms of the
                agreement to her advantage. The rule applies only when the parties entered
                into a valid written contract and intended the writing to contain their
                entire agreement. In other words, if the writing is clear, definite, and
                complete, the law presumes that the parties reduced their entire agreement
                to that writing. Thus, parol evidence is not admissible to add to, vary,
                or contradict the writing. The rule, however, does not prevent the introduction
                of evidence that is intended to prove that no contract was formed. For
                example, the defendant has the right to introduce evidence that the contract
                was illegal and void or was entered into under duress.</p>
            <p class="txt"
            id="loma311-ch4-p-253">The parol evidence rule also applies only when the written contract is
                clear and unambiguous. In such cases, the court will enforce the contract
                as written and will exclude parol evidence that contradicts the written
                contract. Parol evidence, however, is admissible to aid a court in interpreting
                a written contract that is unclear. For example, the parties are allowed
                to introduce evidence to explain the meaning of technical terms and terms
                that have a special trade meaning or a special meaning in the locality
                where the contract was completed.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-254">As with most procedural rules, the parol evidence rule has a number of
                exceptions. The following are some specific situations in which courts
                permit the use of parol evidence:</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch4-ul-16">
                <li id="loma311-ch4-li-84">
                    <p id="loma311-ch4-p-255">When it is reasonably certain that the written contract does not contain
                        all of the terms that the parties intended to include in their agreement,
                        the courts permit parol evidence to prove the omitted terms.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch4-li-85">
                    <p id="loma311-ch4-p-256">When the parties made an oral agreement after they reduced their original
                        agreement to writing, the courts permit parol evidence concerning the subsequent
                        oral agreement.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch4-li-86">
                    <p id="loma311-ch4-p-257">When the written contract does not express the true intent of the parties,
                        the courts permit parol evidence concerning the actual intent of the parties.
                        For example, assume that the parties agreed on a contract price of $10,000
                        but mistakenly drafted the written contract to state a price of $100,000.
                        The parties are permitted to introduce parol evidence concerning the contract
                        price.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch4-p-258">To avoid ambiguity regarding the admissibility of parol evidence, contracts
                will often include an <em>entire contract provision</em>, which states that
                the entirety of the agreement between the parties is contained in the contract.
                We discuss the entire contract provision in more detail in Chapter 10.</p>
