However, sometimes a beneficiary survives the insured for a short period of time, called <em>short-term survivorship</em>, and the right to receive the life insurance policy proceeds vests in the beneficiary at the insured’s death. If the beneficiary dies before receiving the policy proceeds, then the insurer must pay the proceeds to the beneficiary’s estate. This situation can cause policy proceeds to be paid in a manner contrary to what the policyowner intended."

This clause requires the beneficiary to survive the insured by a stated period of time, usually 30 or 60 days, to be entitled to receive the policy proceeds. If the beneficiary does not survive for the stated period of time, the insurer pays the proceeds as if the insured outlived the beneficiary. When a policy includes a survivorship clause, the insurer must delay paying a death claim until the required survivorship period has expired (or the beneficiary dies, if earlier). Thus, for example, if a policy requires the beneficiary to survive the insured by at least 30 days, then the insurer must wait until the earlier of the end of the specified 30-day period or the death of the beneficiary before paying the policy proceeds. Video 14.1 shows the effect of a survivorship clause."

Mr. Milo boarded a plane for a direct flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Mr. Milo was seen boarding the plane by several airport officials. While in flight to Hong Kong, the plane experienced mechanical failure and crashed. A subsequent investigation revealed no survivors, and Mr. Milo’s body was never recovered. In this situation, the plane crash is an identifiable cause of Mr. Milo’s disappearance, and circumstances suggest that Mr. Milo is likely dead. Thus, a court is likely to enter an order declaring that Mr. Milo is dead, and XYZ Life will pay the claim."
