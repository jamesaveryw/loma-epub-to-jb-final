Insurers might seek this type of remedy to resolve issues involving interpretation of policy provisions or insurance laws. For instance, if an insurer has a question about the legality of a new insurance law, the insurer might ask a court to issue a declaratory judgment interpreting the law. Another example is that competing beneficiaries may file an action for a declaratory judgment to establish the proper beneficiary of a life insurance policy."

Restitution sometimes is granted as a legal remedy and other times as an equitable remedy. For life insurance policies, restitution is a remedy that might be sought when an insurer overpays policy proceeds or pays proceeds to the wrong claimant. For example, assume that an insurer pays policy proceeds to the wrong claimant. Later, the proper claimant asserts his claim to the proceeds, and the insurer discovers that it paid the wrong claimant. The insurer can then seek restitution from the claimant who was not entitled to the proceeds. In such a situation, a court likely would order the claimant who was not entitled to the proceeds to repay the insurer the amount of policy proceeds paid in error."
