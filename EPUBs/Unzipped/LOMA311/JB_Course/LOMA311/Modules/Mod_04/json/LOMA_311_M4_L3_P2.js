The seller must be certain that a viatical settlement is the proper instrument to meet her needs; in some cases, an accelerated death benefit or policy loan might be more beneficial, as these options would allow the policyowner to receive some cash while retaining ownership of the policy. Also, the lump sum payment for the sale of the policy may be taxable, depending on the tax laws in the state where the seller resides. The risk to the purchaser is that the seller might live longer than expected, thus reducing or even eliminating the return on the purchaser’s investment. The insight below explains the origins of viatical settlements."
