A corporation that controls extensive financial resources is the frequent target of lawsuits, some of which may be frivolous. The civil litigation process can work both to a company’s advantage and to the company’s disadvantage. For example, an insurer could rely on a court to settle a dispute between two beneficiaries, but the same insurer could also be subject to a lawsuit in which a person challenges the insurer’s decision to deny a claim. Therefore, an insurer must be aware of a court system’s rules and procedures that define civil court proceedings. Specific rules and procedures vary slightly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but the general procedures and principles we describe are fairly uniform across the United States."
