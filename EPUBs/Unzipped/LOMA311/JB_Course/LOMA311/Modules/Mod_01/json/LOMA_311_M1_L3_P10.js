Typically, however, when employees work more than 40 hours in a week they must be paid at an overtime rate of at least 1½ times their normal hourly wage rate. Most employees covered by the FLSA are considered <em>nonexempt employees</em>. As such, they are entitled to overtime pay. <em>Exempt employees</em>, on the other hand, are not entitled to overtime pay. Generally, employees are classified as exempt or nonexempt based on how much they are paid, how they are paid, and the kind of work they do. For example, officers, managers, and certain credentialed professionals, such as attorneys, might be considered exempt employees, while all other employees would be nonexempt employees."

If the EEOC decides there is “reasonable cause” to believe discrimination has occurred, it tries to conciliate the charge by reaching a voluntary resolution between the parties to the complaint. If conciliation is not successful, the EEOC may file a lawsuit in federal court. The EEOC also may issue a right-to-sue-notice to the party who alleges the discrimination. A <em>right-to-sue-notice</em> allows the charging party to file an individual action in court without the EEOC’s involvement. Thus, before a person is permitted to file a civil lawsuit, he must pursue his claim with the EEOC."
