Your ownership also includes the right to dispose of the truck, by bequeathing it, giving it away, or selling it on whatever terms you choose. You can also use the truck as security for a loan by giving a creditor a security interest in the truck. A <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">security interest</span> is a claim against a debtor’s property that gives a creditor the right to possession of the property if the debtor defaults on the underlying loan.

An owner’s rights in property, however, are not always absolute, because property rights may be subject to some governmental restrictions.

Examples of a local government’s use of police power with regard to property include zoning laws and building codes. For instance, a local government might zone a portion of land for use as commercial property as opposed to residential property."
