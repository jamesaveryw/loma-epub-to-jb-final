If the offeree does not accept the offer within the specified time, the offer terminates—or <em>lapses</em>—at the end of the specified time. If the offeror does not specify a time limit, an offer is considered to remain open for a reasonable length of time. What constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the particular situation. The subject matter of the transaction, the manner in which an offer was communicated, and customs and trade practices may be relevant to determining what a reasonable time may be. For example, an offer to buy perishable goods, communicated by telephone, probably implies that an immediate reply is requested. Conversely, an offer to buy imperishable goods, communicated by physical mail, does not imply that an immediate reply is expected."

One of the primary common law exceptions states that a contract for necessaries is not voidable by a minor. <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">Necessaries</span>are goods and services that a minor or other incapacitated person actually requires to sustain her well-being. Whether specific goods and services are necessaries is a question of fact that must be answered on a case-by-case basis. For example, a court typically considers food, clothing, lodging, and medical attention to be necessaries, unless the minor does not actually need them. Thus, if a minor lives with his parents, and they provide him with food and clothing, a contract a minor enters into to purchase food or clothing probably is not a contract for necessaries. Although a minor may not avoid a contract for necessaries, the minor is required to pay only the reasonable value of such necessaries. Thus, if the contract price is greater than the reasonable value of the necessaries, the minor cannot be forced to pay the full contract price. "

The primary example of an illegal contract is a <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">wagering contract</span> in which either party may gain or lose depending on the outcome of an uncertain event, such as a sporting event. Private wagering agreements are illegal and unenforceable. Recall that insurance contracts are aleatory contracts. State laws impose an insurable interest requirement to guard against insurance contracts being purchased as wagering contracts. An <span class=\"keyterm\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\">insurable interest</span> exists when a person is likely to suffer a genuine loss or detriment should the event insured against occur. If the insurable interest requirement is met when a policy is purchased, the contract is not an illegal wagering agreement. We describe the insurable interest requirement further in Chapter 10."

Many obligations arise from applicable laws, such as obligations that arise when one’s negligence harms another. An obligation may also arise as the result of a contract. For example, a person who enters into a contract to hire another person becomes obligated to pay the agreed-upon wages in exchange for the other party’s performance of the work. Civil law jurisdictions often impose the following requirements for the formation of a valid contract:"
