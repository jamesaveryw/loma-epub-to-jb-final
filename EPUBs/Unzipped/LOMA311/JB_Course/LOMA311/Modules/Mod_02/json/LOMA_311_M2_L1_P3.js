With certain exceptions, an informal contract may be either oral or written. Informal contracts expressed in writing do not need a seal to be enforceable. Today, many written informal contracts are electronic in nature, such as a software application’s terms of use agreement. Even without a seal or a physical copy, by expressing an agreement in writing, the parties provide evidence of the specific terms of the contract.
