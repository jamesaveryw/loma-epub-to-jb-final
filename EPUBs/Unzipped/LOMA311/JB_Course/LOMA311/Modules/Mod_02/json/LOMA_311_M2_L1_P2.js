A choice of laws provision usually specifies a jurisdiction with which at least one party has a connection. In individual life insurance, state law may specify that this jurisdiction is the state in which the policy is issued or delivered, which is generally the state of residence of the insured at the time of purchase. This jurisdiction is sometimes referred to as the <em>situs</em> of the contract. Courts typically apply the laws of the place designated by the parties and referred to in the contract."
