Like insurers, regulators rely on technology to reduce operating costs and improve productivity, accuracy, and the effectiveness of key activities. For example, some regulators now use data analytics to detect insurers and individuals who may be engaged in practices that violate laws. Also, some regulators use artificial intelligence to analyze regulatory filings. In addition, regulators monitor the use of technology by insurers. When regulators address the impact of technology on the insurance market, they often look to protect consumers by focusing on data security and market conduct practices. They examine activities such as data collection, pricing, underwriting, claims, and customer notification. The insight below describes how the NAIC is approaching this important issue."
