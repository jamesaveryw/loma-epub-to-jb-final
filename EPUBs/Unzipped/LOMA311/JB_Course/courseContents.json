position of public trust. Millions of families rely on life insurance and annuity products for savings and financial protection against the risks of dying too soon or outliving assets. Also, the reserves held by life insurers are one of the largest sources of private funds in the world’s financial markets.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-24\">Life insurers balance the needs of a variety of stakeholders. By <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-stakeholders\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-6\" role=\"doc-glossref\">stakeholders</span>we mean the parties who have an interest in how the company conducts its business. A life insurance company’s stakeholders include stockholders (for stock companies), the board of directors, executives, managers, employees, agents, potential customers, policyowners, beneficiaries, annuity participants, and regulators, among others. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-25\">The financial health and business practices of life insurance companies are of such importance to society that governments rely on the legal system to put in place specific insurance laws and regulations that safeguard this public trust. Also, in a business as complex and important as the life insurance industry, mistakes and disagreements happen, and the parties often turn to the legal system to resolve disputes.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-26\">A legal system includes two major components: (1) <em>laws and regulations</em> that regulate conduct and (2) <em>legal processes</em> to enforce those laws and regulations. The laws and regulations provide guidelines and rules to help people, companies, and governments interact in an orderly way. The legal processes are used to resolve disputes, provide remedies for victims, and punish those who break laws. A legal system enables individuals and organizations to anticipate the outcomes of their actions with some certainty, manage affairs with a minimum of conflict, and resolve disputes fairly.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-27\">Life insurers, like most other businesses, must comply with general business regulations. They also must comply with insurance regulations. Furthermore, certain areas of law, such as contract law, agency law, and property law, have a significant impact on how life insurers conduct business.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-28\">For years, leaders in the life insurance industry have cited regulation as a major challenge. This observation is especially true today. Increased competition and customer expectations put pressure on companies to innovate. Technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and predictive analytics are driving new business models. As companies change the way they do business, they increase the risk of not complying with existing laws. Not only must insurers comply with all existing laws, they must contend with new and evolving regulations and court decisions. Insurers must be careful to avoid fines, lawsuits, and negative publicity, all of which can harm the company’s reputation and profits.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-29\"><em>Business Law for Insurance Professionals</em> provides a basic knowledge of the legal system as well as legal and regulatory issues unique to the life insurance industry. With the knowledge this course provides, you will be more aware of potential legal and regulatory challenges that may arise as you perform your job. In many cases, employees are considered agents of the company, and their communications and activities create legally binding obligations. An understanding of legal and regulatory principles can help you become a more effective employee.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-30\">Although this text focuses primarily on the United States, the types of legal issues it addresses apply in most countries. For students who work outside the United States, familiarity with these issues should help prepare you for the challenges of your own legal system. Specific laws vary by country, but many legal principles are similar around the world. Also, as globalization of the life insurance industry continues, many insurers and their employees must understand how the legal system works in every country in which their company operates.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

In many countries, including the United States, another primary source of law is case law created by the courts.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-5\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-1\">Constitutions</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-32\">Almost every country has adopted a constitution. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-constitution\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-7\" role=\"doc-glossref\">constitution</span> is a document or group of documents that sets out the fundamental principles that determine the powers and duties of the government and the rights of the people. It is a basic part of a country’s legal system and is intended to be a relatively permanent and primary source of law. A constitution typically is considered the supreme law of the land. Any laws found to violate a country’s constitution generally are invalid.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-33\">In a given <em>jurisdiction</em>, or geographic area of legal authority, a constitution usually establishes the organizational structure of the government. Most governments are designed to carry out three primary functions: (1) create the laws, (2) administer and enforce the laws, and (3) resolve disputes. Therefore, in most countries the constitution divides governmental powers among three branches of government:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch1-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-27\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch1-p-34\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-legislativebranch\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">legislative branch</span> consists of one or more legislative bodies—often referred to as a legislature or parliament—that are responsible for enacting laws to govern the applicable jurisdiction.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-28\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch1-p-35\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-executivebranch\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-9\" role=\"doc-glossref\">executive branch</span> consists of a system of <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-administrativeagencies\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-10\" role=\"doc-glossref\">administrative agencies</span>—often referred to as departments or ministries—that are responsible for administering, enforcing, or carrying out the jurisdiction’s laws.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-29\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch1-p-36\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-judicialbranch\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-11\" role=\"doc-glossref\">judicial branch</span> consists of a system of courts that are responsible for applying and interpreting the jurisdiction’s laws and for resolving disputes; in addition, many countries promote alternative dispute resolution methods.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-37\">Like many constitutions, the U.S. Constitution establishes a system of checks and balances. These checks and balances place restraints on each branch of government to prevent the concentration of power in any one branch. By contrast, other countries are <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-parliamentarydemocracies\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-12\" role=\"doc-glossref\">parliamentary democracies</span> in which the legislative branch of government, usually known as the <em>Parliament</em>, has ultimate authority for making all laws. The insight below provides additional information about parliamentary democracies.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-6\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Parliamentary Democracies\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-14\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-38\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-7\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-39\">Parliamentary Democracies</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-40\">Countries within the British Commonwealth, most European countries, India, and Singapore are examples of parliamentary democracies.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-41\">Specific details of how a parliamentary system operates vary by country, but the executive branch of government typically is led by a prime minister. The prime minister is the individual who heads the political party—or coalition of parties—that holds a majority of elected seats in the Parliament. Upon taking office, the prime minister names a Cabinet of individuals who serve as advisors.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-42\">The individuals who make up the executive branch hold office as long as the Parliament has confidence in how the executive branch is leading the government. If the Parliament votes that it no longer has confidence in the executive branch’s ability to lead the government, the prime minister and the Cabinet resign and Parliament is dissolved. Then elections are held to create a new Parliament from which the next prime minister will be elected.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-43\">Many countries, including the United States, have established a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-federalsystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-13\" role=\"doc-glossref\">federal system</span> in which a federal government and a number of lower-level governments share governmental powers. In other words, a group of sovereign states are unified as a nation. For example, the United States is a federation of 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several territories. Figure 1.1 shows some other countries that have a federal system of government. Of the countries shown in this figure, Canada, Malaysia, and Mexico are federations; the other countries are unions.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1211px;\" id=\"figure1-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-44\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-14\">Figure 1.1</span> Countries with a Federal System of Government</p> <img alt=\"Countries with a Federal System of Government\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-15\" src=\"../../imgs/1-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-8\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure1-1\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-15\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-9\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure1-1\" id=\"loma311-ch1-a-10\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 1-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-45\">In a federal system, the federal constitution is the nation’s supreme law. All other laws must be consistent with the constitution. Typically, each state also has a state constitution that serves as the state’s fundamental law. All state laws must be consistent with the federal constitution and the applicable state constitution. The federal constitution typically provides a method of dividing governmental powers between the federal and state governments.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-46\">As an example, the U.S. Constitution enumerates the specific powers that are delegated to the federal government, and all governmental powers not specifically given to the federal government are left to the state governments. The states are responsible for a range of functions, including regulating businesses and professions within their borders, providing for public schools, and protecting the health and safety of people. States delegate some of their governmental authority to local governmental units such as counties and municipalities.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-10\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-2\">Statutes</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-47\">The legislative branch of government is composed of one or more legislative bodies that are authorized to enact laws to govern the applicable jurisdiction. (For the sake of consistency, we use the term <em>legislature</em> to refer to such a legislative body.) The laws enacted by a legislature are referred to as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-statutes\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-16\" role=\"doc-glossref\">statutes</span>, which typically declare, command, or prohibit something. These legislative enactments create the body of law known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-statutorylaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">statutory law</span>, as opposed to <em>case law</em>, which we describe later in our discussion of sources of law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-48\">The authority of a legislature to enact laws is limited by the applicable constitution. When a legislature exceeds its constitutional powers in enacting a law, that law is unconstitutional and therefore illegal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-49\">In the United States, the federal and state constitutions authorize the creation of legislatures, which typically consist of two houses. The legislative branch of the federal government is referred to as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-congress\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Congress</span>, and the two houses are the Senate and the House of Representatives. The legislative branch of a state government often is referred to as the legislature or general assembly.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-50\">All of the laws enacted by each legislative body are compiled and organized into a collection of laws that typically is referred to as a <em>code</em>. The names given to such codes vary by jurisdiction. In the United States, all of the federal statutes have been compiled as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-uscode\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">U.S. Code</span>. The laws enacted by a given state typically are known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-statecode\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-20\" role=\"doc-glossref\">state code</span>. The U.S. and state codes are further subdivided into discrete sections, and each section regulates a specific area of law. For example, the federal tax laws are found in a portion of the U.S. Code that is generally referred to as the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Similarly, a portion of each state code regulates the insurance industry within the state and is often known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-stateinsurancecode\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">state insurance code</span>.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-11\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-3\">Administrative Regulations</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-51\">The executive branch of government is authorized to administer and enforce a jurisdiction’s laws. In the United States, the federal executive branch, headed by the president, is responsible for carrying out federal laws. The executive branch of a state government, headed by the state’s governor, is responsible for carrying out the laws of that state. As we noted earlier, each executive branch of government consists of administrative agencies that are responsible for administering, enforcing, or carrying out the jurisdiction’s laws. Figure 1.2 shows a few of the many U.S. federal and state administrative agencies.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1155px;\" id=\"figure1-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-52\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-22\">Figure 1.2</span> Examples of U.S. Administrative Agencies</p> <img alt=\"Examples of U.S. Administrative Agencies\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-16\" src=\"../../imgs/1-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-12\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure1-2\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-23\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-13\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure1-2\" id=\"loma311-ch1-a-11\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 1-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-53\">In many jurisdictions, including the United States, the legislatures enact statutes in relatively general terms and delegate authority to the executive branch to adopt regulations to fill in the details of the law. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-regulations\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-24\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Regulations</span> are rules or orders that are issued by administrative agencies and that also have the force and effect of law, as long as they do not conflict with the underlying statute. Regulations make up the body of law known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-administrativelaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-25\" role=\"doc-glossref\">administrative law</span>. The regulations of each governmental unit are compiled into that jurisdiction’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-administrativecode\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-26\" role=\"doc-glossref\">administrative code</span>. For example, the regulations of a state are compiled into that state’s administrative code. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-54\">In the United States, the administrative agency responsible for administering a specific aspect of the law also is responsible for adopting regulations. These regulations fill in the details of that aspect of the law. For example, each state’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-insurancedepartment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-27\" role=\"doc-glossref\">insurance department</span> or <em>department of insurance (DOI)</em>, as shown in Figure 1.2, is responsible for enforcing the state insurance code and making certain that insurers conducting business within the state comply with all state insurance laws. In addition, the insurance department adopts <em>regulations</em> to fill in the details of the state insurance laws and enforces these regulations. The insurance department operates under the direction of an official typically known as the <em>insurance commissioner</em>.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-14\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-55\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-15\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-56\">A state legislature enacts a law governing life insurance and annuity replacements. To facilitate compliance with this law, the insurance department adopts a regulation that clarifies the definitions in the law. The regulation also includes a “notice of replacement” form for insurers to give to individuals during the replacement process.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-57\">Typically, regulations are issued through a formal rulemaking process. The agency proposes a regulation and publishes it with a specified comment period during which interested parties may provide written comments. The agency may also hold a public hearing in which interested parties have the opportunity to comment. At the end of the comment period, the agency considers the comments and may finalize the regulation with or without changes. If the changes are substantial, the agency may re-propose the regulation. From time to time, the agency may clarify a regulation by issuing a bulletin or other document, which is sometimes called <em>sub-regulatory guidance</em>.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-16\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-4\">Treaties and International Agreements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-58\">Another source of law is a treaty. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-treaty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-28\" role=\"doc-glossref\">treaty</span> is a legally binding agreement entered into by two or more nations that agree to abide by the terms of the agreement. Treaties may be referred to by various terms, including <em>conventions</em> and <em>pacts</em>. When a nation signs a treaty, it generally agrees to enforce the terms of the treaty within its borders. It also agrees to cooperate with other nations in enforcing the treaty. There are many types of treaties. Political treaties establish military alliances, end wars, and settle boundary disputes, among other things. Commercial treaties deal with trade and tariff issues. Countries enter into legal treaties under which they agree to abide by common patent and copyright protections. As Chapter 3 shows, certain treaties, such as those regarding money laundering and international trade, apply to insurers.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-17\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-5\">Case Law</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-59\">In common law jurisdictions, which we describe in the next section, the written decisions of the courts form a body of law known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-caselaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-29\" role=\"doc-glossref\">case law</span>. All legal systems have some type of judicial system—or court system—that is responsible for applying the laws to specific cases. Courts may apply both substantive and procedural laws to a case.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-60\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-substantivelaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-30\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Substantive laws</span> create, define, and regulate legal rights and duties. Examples of substantive laws are how a statute defines fraudulent misrepresentation or the punishment that a person convicted of insurance fraud may receive.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-61\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-procedurallaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Procedural laws</span> specify the rules and methods that courts use to enforce substantive laws. For example, a court’s procedural law may require that a defendant answer a complaint within 30 days of being served with the complaint. Procedural laws provide a guideline of how cases proceed through a court system. Additionally, procedural laws specify the types of cases that each court has jurisdiction to hear. In this sense, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-jurisdiction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">jurisdiction</span> refers to the authority of a court to hear specific cases or, in the event of overlapping authorities, the most appropriate forum to hear the case.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-62\">Although court systems are organized in many different ways, they typically have a variety of <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-trialcourts\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-33\" role=\"doc-glossref\">trial courts</span>, which are sometimes called <em>courts of original jurisdiction</em> because they are the courts that first hear disputes. Most court systems also have <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-appellatecourts\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">appellate courts</span>that are authorized to review the decisions of lower courts. Thus, a party that loses a case heard by a trial court may have the right to appeal—or contest—that decision by asking an appellate court to review the trial court’s decision. State and federal appellate courts issue a written opinion for most noncriminal cases they decide. These appellate court decisions are published in a series of volumes known as <em>reports</em> or <em>reporters</em>. Courts may also issue unpublished opinions. An <em>unpublished opinion</em> is a decision of a court that is not available for citation in subsequent court cases. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-63\">Most courts also engage in the important function of interpreting statutes and regulations. For example, statutes usually are expressed in relatively general terms that are designed to cover a wide range of situations. As a result, a law’s intent may be clear, but its application to a specific situation may be unclear. In such cases, the courts generally have authority to interpret the meaning of statutes. These decisions are considered by subsequent courts that may be called upon to decide similar issues. In this way, the courts serve as a source of law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-64\">Figure 1.3 gives a recap of the typical sources of law.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1107px;\" id=\"figure1-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-65\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-35\">Figure 1.3</span> Sources of Law</p> <img alt=\"Sources of Law\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-17\" src=\"../../imgs/1-3figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-18\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure1-3\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-36\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-19\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure1-3\" id=\"loma311-ch1-a-12\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 1-3 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-2-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-2\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-66\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-18\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-2-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-67\">True/False: Although some employees of a life insurer are considered agents of the company, the vast majority of employees are not considered agents.

The legal system determines how laws are created and interpreted in the jurisdiction in which an insurer operates. Figure 1.4 shows some of the countries that have adopted each type of legal system.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1119px;\" id=\"figure1-4\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-92\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-45\">Figure 1.4</span> Type of Legal System in Various Countries</p> <img alt=\"Type of Legal System in Various Countries\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-44\" src=\"../../imgs/1-4figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <p class=\"fig-source\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-93\"><a class=\"pdf_inline_style\" href=\"javascript:jb_src(0)\">Source</a></p> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-34\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure1-4\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-46\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-35\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure1-4\" id=\"loma311-ch1-a-17\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 1-4 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-36\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-6\">Common Law Systems</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-94\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-commonlawsystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">common law system</span> is a legal system based on the common law of England. The system was created in feudal England. At that time, courts were created to resolve disputes in accordance with the customs of the local area. These local customs often were referred to as <em>common laws</em>. Over the years, the courts developed an unwritten body of general principles of law based both on local customs and on public policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-95\">A geographic area of legal authority that bases its legal system on the common law of England is referred to as a <em>common law jurisdiction</em>. Most English-speaking countries that were colonized by England—including the United States—have adopted common law systems. Also, many non-English-speaking countries have adopted elements of the common law system.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-96\">In its broadest sense, the common law is an uncodified body of general principles and rules of law developed and followed by the courts. Today, these common law principles are found in the courts’ written decisions. These general common law principles supplement the laws enacted by the legislature and thus form a large component of the law of a common law jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-97\">An important feature of the common law system is that, in making decisions, the courts follow a general rule known as the doctrine of stare decisis, a Latin term that means “to stand by that which is decided.” According to the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-doctrineofstaredecisis\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-48\" role=\"doc-glossref\">doctrine of stare decisis</span>, when a court finds that a specific principle of law applies to a certain set of facts, the court will apply that principle to all future cases in which the facts are substantially the same. The decision in such a prior case is known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-precedent\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-49\" role=\"doc-glossref\">precedent</span>. A court in a common law jurisdiction generally is bound to adhere to its own precedents and to the precedents established by higher courts in the same jurisdiction. By relying on precedent, the courts are able to enforce the laws in a uniform, predictable, and impartial manner.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-98\">Although common law courts are bound to follow precedent, the doctrine of stare decisis is not totally inflexible. The courts have authority to depart from precedent when the facts of a case warrant it or when strong public policy reasons favor such a departure. For example, a court can depart from a precedent by distinguishing the case under consideration from the precedent. In other words, the court can find ways in which the two cases differ so that it can arrive at a different decision. A court also may depart from a precedent when following the precedent would cause an unjust result.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-99\">A precedent remains in force until (1) a court overturns the precedent or (2) the legislature enacts a statute that changes the legal principle that underlies the precedent. Thus, the courts and the legislatures are able to modify and change the law to keep pace with changing times and circumstances.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-100\">Sometimes, no statute or precedents apply to an issue before a court. In such cases, the courts apply the general principles of common law.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-37\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-7\">Civil Law Systems</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-101\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-civillawsystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-50\" role=\"doc-glossref\">civil law system</span> is a legal system based on the Roman legal system in which the laws are codified into written codes enacted by the legislature. In this context, a <em>code</em> is a comprehensive written statement of rules that embody the general principles of law in a given civil law jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction has enacted a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-civilcode\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-51\" role=\"doc-glossref\">civil code</span> comprising general principles of law that apply to relationships between people that arise through birth, adoption, marriage, death, contracts, and personal liability. The civil code usually regulates property rights as well. Each jurisdiction also has enacted codes that govern other areas of the law. For example, a commercial code regulates commercial transactions and business organizations. Other codes contain laws applicable to insurance companies, banks, financial instruments, and so on.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-102\">Many countries in Europe and in Central and South America have adopted civil law systems. The French brought civil law systems to the United States. Only a few states, including Louisiana, have based any part of their legal systems on the civil law. Instead, the U.S. federal government and most state governments have adopted the common law system.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-103\">Civil law courts follow a different decision-making procedure than that followed by common law courts. Even so, the courts in both types of jurisdictions often arrive at similar decisions on similar issues. A court in a civil law jurisdiction looks first to the jurisdiction’s codes for the applicable rules of law. If the codes do not specifically cover the subject at issue, the court decides in accordance with the general principles of law that are set out in the applicable code. Although civil law courts are not bound to follow precedents as common law courts are, courts in civil law jurisdictions are influenced by their own prior decisions and the decisions of the jurisdiction’s higher courts on similar issues.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-104\">Watch Video 1.1 to see a comparison of the decision making procedures in common law courts and civil law courts.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video1-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-105\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-52\">Video 1.1</span> Overview of Courts’ Decision-Making Procedures</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-38\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-39\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-106\">Overview of Courts’ Decision-Making Procedures</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/1-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

In some countries, for example, the legal system includes elements of both the common law system and the civil law system.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-108\">In many countries the legal systems have been greatly influenced by the religion of Islam. Under an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-islamiclegalsystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-60\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Islamic legal system</span>, the law is set out in the <em>Koran</em> (or <em>Qur’an</em>), and the law of the Koran is unchanging. The legal systems in these countries often have elements of common law systems or civil law systems or both, and elements of Islamic law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-109\">Many other countries have mixed legal systems that include a <em>customary law system</em> with a common law and/or civil law system. In a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-customarylawsystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-61\" role=\"doc-glossref\">customary law system</span>, members of a community have accepted local customs as binding on the community’s members. For example, customs may govern the personal affairs of individuals by establishing rules for marriage, separation, divorce, and adoption. In some places, customary laws help communities maintain their physical well-being by establishing rules for how houses must be constructed and how the community provides food. Customary laws often set out punishments that the community imposes on individuals who violate these laws. The matters in which customary law may be applied vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In a number of countries, the government formally recognizes customary laws as binding and enforceable by the government. So, for example, a court may rule on an insurance dispute based on its interpretation of local customary law.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-110\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-57\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-111\">True/False: An important feature of the common law system is that, in making decisions, the courts follow a general rule known as the doctrine of stare decisis, a Latin term that means “to stand by that which is decided.”</p> </div> <ol aria-labelledby=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-label\" class=\"choices\" id=\"loma311-ch1-ol-9\" role=\"radiogroup\"> <li aria-checked=\"false\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-i0\" role=\"radio\" tabindex=\"0\"> <label for=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-i0\">True</label> <div class=\"radio-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-52\"> <div class=\"check\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-53\">&#160;</div> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-58\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-59\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-60\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-61\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs-light.png\" /> </div> </li> <li aria-checked=\"false\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-i1\" role=\"radio\" tabindex=\"-1\"> <label for=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-i1\">False</label> <div class=\"radio-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-54\"> <div class=\"check\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-55\">&#160;</div> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-62\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-63\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-64\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-65\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs-light.png\" /> </div> </li> </ol> <p class=\"reveal\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-112\"><span class=\"btn\" data-answer=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-key\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-64\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Submit</span> </p> </div> <div class=\"question-container-static visible\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-static\"> <p class=\"q-title-static\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-113\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-66\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <p class=\"q-stem-static\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-114\">True/False: An important feature of the common law system is that, in making decisions, the courts follow a general rule known as the doctrine of stare decisis, a Latin term that means “to stand by that which is decided.”</p> <ol class=\"choices-static\" id=\"loma311-ch1-ol-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-i0-static\">True</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-question-5-i1-static\">False</li> </ol> <p class=\"reveal-static\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-115\"><a class=\"btn-static\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/answer-key.xhtml#loma311-ch1-question-5-key\" id=\"loma311-ch1-a-19\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Check your answer</a> </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-6\"> <!--<p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-116\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-67\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p>--> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch1-question-6-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-117\">True/False: Many countries in Europe and in Central and South America have adopted civil law systems.

Each court system operates as a separate and independent unit. In this section, we describe the organization of the federal and state court systems in the United States. The insight below provides two other examples of how judicial systems are organized.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-60\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Examples of Judicial Systems\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-77\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-123\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-61\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-124\">Examples of Judicial Systems</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-125\"><strong>Argentina</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-126\">Like the United States, Argentina has a federal system of government and a federal court system. Argentina also has created a provincial court system. Federal courts have jurisdiction over matters involving the federal government, conflicts between provinces, and certain matters specified by federal law. Provincial courts have jurisdiction over all other matters. Federal and provincial courts have overlapping jurisdiction in many matters.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-127\">The federal Supreme Court of Justice is the highest court in the nation. Specialized federal courts, known as <em>forums</em>, each have jurisdiction over specific matters. Such courts include a civil forum, a criminal forum, a labor forum, an administrative forum, a family forum, and a commercial forum. The provincial court systems are similarly organized, with a Supreme Court and specialized courts. Provincial court systems usually include at least three forums: a civil forum, a criminal forum, and a labor forum.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-128\"><strong>Hong Kong</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-129\">Although Hong Kong is a region of China, it has an independent court system composed of a number of courts. Lower courts include the District Court, which is a court of original jurisdiction that hears both civil and criminal cases; a number of Magistrates’ Courts that hear criminal cases; the Labour Tribunal that handles disputes between employers and employees; and the Small Claims Tribunal that hears civil cases involving less than a stated sum of money. The highest appellate court is the Court of Final Appeal. It hears both civil and criminal appeals from the High Court. The High Court consists of two separate courts:</p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-62\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-63\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch1-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-43\">The Court of First Instance is a court of original jurisdiction. It hears a variety of civil and criminal matters. It also hears appeals from lower courts.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-44\">The Court of Appeal hears appeals from the Court of First Instance and the lower courts.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p class=\"source-line\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-130\"><a class=\"pdf_inline_style\" href=\"javascript:jb_src(0)\">Source</a></p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-64\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-9\">Federal Court System</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-131\">The U.S. federal court system consists of three levels of courts: district courts, circuit courts of appeal, and the Supreme Court.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch1-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch1-p-132\"><em>District courts</em> sit in every state and territory and act as trial courts with jurisdiction to hear only specific types of cases as set out in the Constitution and various federal laws. A federal law might, for instance, require a matter to exceed a specified value or dollar amount for it to be heard by a district court. Figure 1.5 identifies the types of cases over which the Constitution gives jurisdiction to the federal courts.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch1-p-133\">Thirteen <em>circuit courts of appeal</em> have jurisdiction to hear cases in which the decision of a district court within that circuit is appealed by one of the parties involved in a trial.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch1-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch1-p-134\">The <em>Supreme Court</em> is the country’s highest court. It hears only certain appeals from lower courts and cases involving any of the states or a foreign official, such as an ambassador. The Court primarily reviews cases that involve a matter of national importance, such as cases that involve the U.S. Constitution or cases in which two or more lower courts have reached different results.</p> </li> </ul> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:731px;\" id=\"figure1-5\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-135\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-68\">Figure 1.5</span> Jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Courts</p> <img alt=\"Jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Courts\" id=\"loma311-ch1-img-78\" src=\"../../imgs/1-5figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-65\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure1-5\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-69\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-66\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure1-5\" id=\"loma311-ch1-a-23\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 1-5 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-136\">The federal court system also includes a variety of special courts that have only limited jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases. For example, the U.S. Tax Court has jurisdiction to hear disputes between taxpayers and the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) involving the payment of federal taxes.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-67\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-10\">State Court Systems</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-137\">As noted earlier, each state court system includes a variety of trial courts. In the United States, each trial court is presided over by a judicial officer, who is generally called a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-judge\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-70\" role=\"doc-glossref\">judge</span>. Most states have two levels of appellate courts. The higher-level appellate court—usually known as the state <em>supreme court</em>—has authority to review the decisions of the lower appellate court—often known as the state <em>court of appeal</em>.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

To keep up with complex and evolving laws and regulations, insurers establish procedures and assign staff to address legal and compliance functions. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-legalfunction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-71\" role=\"doc-glossref\">legal function</span> refers to actions a company takes to handle legal matters such as contracts and lawsuits. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-compliancefunction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-72\" role=\"doc-glossref\">compliance function</span> refers to actions a company takes to make sure it follows the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where it operates. Insurers delegate responsibility for these functions in a variety of ways. Most companies have a <em>legal department</em>, also known as a <em>law department</em>, to handle issues related to law. In some companies the legal department also handles compliance functions. In others, the legal and compliance functions are in different departments.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-139\">The person in charge of an insurer’s legal department usually is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-generalcounsel\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-73\" role=\"doc-glossref\">general counsel</span> or <em>chief counsel</em>. This position typically reports directly to the chief executive officer (CEO). The general counsel advises the CEO and board of directors on legal issues that affect the company. Attorneys and other legal staff report to the general counsel. These staff members may have responsibilities such as providing legal advice on agency law, developing agent contracts, advising on the rights of applicants during the underwriting process, assisting claim managers in interpreting policy language, and handling litigation of contested claims.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-140\">In most companies, a high-level executive has overall accountability for compliance. This executive can be the corporation’s general counsel or the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-chiefcomplianceofficer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-74\" role=\"doc-glossref\">chief compliance officer</span> (CCO) who is responsible for overseeing and managing the company’s compliance with regulatory requirements and applicable internal policies and procedures. The CCO might report to the general counsel, directly to the CEO, or sometimes directly to a compliance committee of the board of directors. Compliance staff report to the CCO. These staff members may have responsibilities such as reviewing advertising and sales literature, overseeing sales activities, advising on product design, submitting policy forms to regulators, and coordinating onsite examinations by regulators.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-141\">In some companies, employees who work in a particular operational area are accountable for the compliance function in that area. For example, compliance staff might be housed in agency operations or underwriting, rather than in the compliance department. Regardless of how compliance is organized, however, all employees are responsible for ensuring compliance in their day-to-day activities.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-142\">As we mentioned earlier, life insurers can be challenged by the legal and regulatory pressures that arise from innovations in technology as well as the complexities of various insurance laws and regulations. One way insurers meet this challenge is with regtech. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-regtech\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-75\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Regtech </span>is a type of technology that helps regulators, as well as insurance companies, manage regulatory and compliance activities more effectively and at a reduced cost. With regtech, for instance, a company might use big data to better manage its compliance records. Similarly, a company might use predictive analytics to identify compliance risks.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch1-div-68\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch1-h3-11\">Compliance and Ethics Programs</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-143\">There are times when companies and employees must make decisions that cannot be based solely on legally established rules. These situations call for ethical guidelines. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-ethics\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-76\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Ethics</span> is a system of accepted standards of conduct and moral judgment that combines honesty, integrity, and fair treatment. Ethical business decisions are in accordance with accepted legal and moral principles of right and wrong. Acting ethically means, among other things, upholding promises to customers, operating in a responsible manner, treating customers and employees equitably, and keeping confidential information private.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-144\">Industry professionals sometimes face situations for which there are no clearly defined rules of right and wrong. In these situations, decisions are likely to be influenced by the individual’s personal values, as well as the likelihood of support within the organization. Thus, individual decisions are influenced by the organization’s corporate culture. By <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch1-gt-corporateculture\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch1-span-77\" role=\"doc-glossref\">corporate culture</span>we mean the values, beliefs, goals, and patterns of behavior that employees of an organization share. Businesses that value ethical conduct typically try to create a corporate culture that emphasizes ethics. Many businesses—especially large corporations—have adopted written standards of ethical conduct. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch1-p-145\">Maintaining a high standard of ethics contributes to an insurer’s overall success. Companies that operate ethically enhance their reputation, gain the trust of stakeholders, and acquire and conserve more business. They are better able to hire and retain quality employees. They are more likely to avoid lawsuits, regulatory actions, and even criminal prosecutions. The United States, like many countries, has enacted criminal laws that apply to businesses as well as individuals. Businesses, for example, can be found guilty of crimes such as fraud, tax evasion, and antitrust violations.

An insurance company can easily be involved in multiple ongoing civil suits at a time. In addition, each legal action can affect an individual employee’s job in a variety of ways. An employee may be required to produce old records, or even to appear in court to provide testimony. Therefore, it is very useful for people working in the insurance industry to understand the rules and procedures of civil actions.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-21\">With these facts in mind, this text focuses primarily on matters of civil law. In common law jurisdictions, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-criminallaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-7\" role=\"doc-glossref\">criminal laws</span> are laws that define certain acts as crimes and provide specific punishments for each crime. In a criminal court case, the government prosecutes its case against the individual charged with the crime. By contrast, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-civillaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">civil laws</span> are laws that are concerned with private—that is, nongovernmental—rights and remedies. A dispute about who has the right to receive life insurance policy proceeds is an example of a civil dispute.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-22\">Civil law jurisdictions typically categorize these laws into the areas of public law and private law. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-publiclaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-9\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Public law</span> refers to those areas of the law that affect the public interest and that govern relationships between the government and nongovernmental parties. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-privatelaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-10\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Private law</span>refers to those areas of the law that primarily involve disputes between nongovernmental parties. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-23\">Most private (civil) disputes are resolved when the parties involved come to a mutual agreement. However, in some disputes, the parties involved cannot agree on a mutually acceptable resolution. Governments typically establish a system for resolving such disputes within their jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions including the United States, the parties generally turn to the courts to resolve civil disputes. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-civillitigation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-11\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Civil litigation</span> is a judicial process by which private parties go to court to enforce a legal right or to obtain a remedy for a civil wrong.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-24\">To file a successful civil lawsuit, a person or business involved in a dispute must have a valid cause of action. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-causeofaction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-12\" role=\"doc-glossref\">cause of action</span> is a set of facts that gives a person the right to judicial relief. In this context, a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-person\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-13\" role=\"doc-glossref\">person</span> is a natural person or an entity, such as a corporation, that the law recognizes as having legal rights and duties. A cause of action arises when:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-22\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-25\">One person has a legal right.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-23\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-26\">Another person has a legal duty to observe that right.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-24\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-27\">The second person breaches her legal duty.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-25\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-28\">The first person suffers a loss or injury as a result of that breach.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-29\">All four elements must be present to create a cause of action. The civil litigation process is designed to help the courts determine whether all four elements of the cause of action are present and, if so, what judicial relief is appropriate.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-30\">Common law jurisdictions provide for two general types of civil causes of action: breach of contract actions and tort actions. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-contract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-14\" role=\"doc-glossref\">contract</span> is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties; the agreement consists of a promise or a set of promises. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-breachofcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-15\" role=\"doc-glossref\">breach of contract</span> is the failure of a party to perform a contractual obligation. For example, if an insurer did not pay a claim that an insurance contract required the company to pay, the insurer may be guilty of breach of contract. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-tort\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-16\" role=\"doc-glossref\">tort</span>is a private wrong—other than a breach of contract—for which the law provides a remedy to the wronged party. We will discuss torts in greater detail later in this chapter. </p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

A corporation that controls extensive financial resources is the frequent target of lawsuits, some of which may be frivolous. The civil litigation process can work both to a company’s advantage and to the company’s disadvantage. For example, an insurer could rely on a court to settle a dispute between two beneficiaries, but the same insurer could also be subject to a lawsuit in which a person challenges the insurer’s decision to deny a claim. Therefore, an insurer must be aware of a court system’s rules and procedures that define civil court proceedings. Specific rules and procedures vary slightly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but the general procedures and principles we describe are fairly uniform across the United States.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-7\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-1\">The Parties</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-32\">Judicial proceedings begin when an injured party, known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-plaintiff\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">plaintiff</span>, files papers with the court setting out her cause of action against the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-defendant\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">defendant</span>. This process is also known as <em>instituting</em> a lawsuit. The plaintiff and defendant are each a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-party\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">party</span> to the action. Any legal person, as defined earlier, can be a party to a civil action.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-8\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-2\">Procedural Stages</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-33\">A civil action consists of three distinct stages: the pleading stage, the discovery stage, and the trial stage. Note, however, that the parties have the right to settle their dispute at any time. As a result, a civil action may terminate by agreement of the parties at any time before the court reaches a verdict. Watch Video 2.1 for a walkthrough of these three stages.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video2-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-34\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-20\">Video 2.1</span> The Civil Litigation Process</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-9\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-10\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-35\">The Civil Litigation Process</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/2-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

Pleadings serve to:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-33\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-37\">Define the issues that are in dispute</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-34\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-38\">Set out the material facts that are involved in the dispute</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-35\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-39\">Set forth the legal theory or theories that the plaintiff is relying on (such as <em>breach of contract</em> or <em>negligence</em>)</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-36\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-40\">Define the judicial relief that the parties seek from the court</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-41\">The two basic types of pleading are the <em>complaint</em> and the <em>answer</em>. Civil proceedings begin when the plaintiff files a complaint with the appropriate court official, such as the clerk of the court. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-complaint\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-28\" role=\"doc-glossref\">complaint</span> is a written document that sets out the cause of action on which the plaintiff bases her claim against the defendant. The procedural rules of each jurisdiction specify the proper form of a complaint, which usually must be personally served on—that is, presented to—the defendant in accordance with specific procedural rules. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-serviceofprocess\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-29\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Service of process</span>, the act of delivering—or serving—the complaint to the defendant, provides the defendant with official notification of the proceeding. Thus, the defendant has the opportunity to appear and be heard.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-42\">Once served with a complaint, the defendant has a specified number of days in which to file with the court an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-answer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-30\" role=\"doc-glossref\">answer</span>, which is a written document filed to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint. In his answer, a defendant can (1) admit or deny each of the facts that the plaintiff alleged in her complaint or (2) answer that he has no knowledge of a fact that the plaintiff alleged. The defendant may also include affirmative defenses and counterclaims in the answer.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-37\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-43\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-affirmativedefense\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">affirmative defense</span> is an allegation of facts that constitute a defense to the plaintiff’s claim. For example, if an applicant for life insurance concealed a vital fact about her health on her policy application, then that <em>misrepresentation</em>—a term for an untrue statement of fact—is an affirmative defense in litigation against the insurer alleging a failure to pay the death benefit.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-38\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-44\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-counterclaim\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">counterclaim</span> is a claim by the defendant against the plaintiff that arises out of the same facts on which the plaintiff’s claim is based. In contract disputes, for example, both parties often have claims against each other. Counterclaims allow parties to resolve multiple disputes in one civil proceeding.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-45\">If a party fails to file a required pleading or files defective pleadings, the court can end the action fairly quickly with either a default judgment or a dismissal of the action. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-defaultjudgment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-33\" role=\"doc-glossref\">default judgment</span> is a judgment entered against a defendant who fails to plead—that is, to file an answer within the required time—or who otherwise fails to defend the lawsuit. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-dismissal\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">dismissal</span> is a court order or judgment that concludes a civil lawsuit without a trial of the issues involved in the lawsuit. Typically, the court dismisses a lawsuit because the plaintiff either failed to prosecute her case—for example, by intentionally delaying the action—or failed to state a valid claim and therefore is not entitled to judicial relief.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-23\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-46\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-24\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-47\">Ivan Alexander files a complaint against the Median Life Insurance Company. Mr. Alexander is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy owned by his mother, Helen Alexander, and issued by Median Life. In the complaint, Mr. Alexander alleges that Median failed to make the full contractually obligated payment to him upon his mother’s death. According to the laws of the local jurisdiction, Median has 30 days to file an answer with the court. Median files an answer 20 days after Mr. Alexander files his complaint, therefore avoiding the risk of the court making a default judgment in Mr. Alexander’s favor.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-25\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-2\">The Discovery Stage</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-48\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-discovery\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-35\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Discovery</span> is a process in which the parties to a civil lawsuit gather information that is relevant to the lawsuit so that they can prepare to present their respective cases at trial.

A judge may try an action either alone or with a jury. In most U.S. trial courts, the parties have the right to request a trial by jury.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-61\">A civil proceeding may involve issues of law as well as issues of fact. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-issueoflaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-43\" role=\"doc-glossref\">issue of law</span> is an issue in which the parties disagree on how the law should be applied to a given set of facts.

During the trial stage, the jury would act as the trier of fact and decide issues of fact, such as whether Median Life did in fact breach the contract. The judge decides issues of law, such as whether the state law even applies, just as she would in a nonjury trial.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-64\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-evidence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Evidence </span>is the means by which the disputed facts in an action are proved or disproved. To be admissible at trial, evidence must be relevant and material to the facts at issue—that is, evidence must tend to prove or disprove a relevant fact. The insight below discusses the rules that govern the admissibility and sufficiency of evidence.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-31\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"The Rules of Evidence\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch2-img-30\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-65\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-32\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-66\">The Rules of Evidence</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-67\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-rulesofevidence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">rules of evidence</span> are procedural rules that govern the admissibility of evidence at trials and determine whether the evidence presented is sufficient to prove the issues involved in an action. The purpose of the rules of evidence is to ensure that the trier of fact does not have to make a judgment based on unreliable or unduly prejudicial evidence.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-68\">In general, the party who alleges a fact as being true is the party who bears the burden of proving that the fact is true. This rule determines the <em>burden of proof</em>, a term with two meanings. First, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-burdenofproof\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-48\" role=\"doc-glossref\">burden of proof</span> means the duty to present evidence to prove a given fact or set of facts. Second, <em>burden of proof</em> means the duty to persuade the trier of fact that an alleged fact is true.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-69\">The initial burden of proof in a civil trial is the duty to present a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-primafaciecase\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-49\" role=\"doc-glossref\">prima facie case</span>, which is evidence that is sufficient to prove the elements of a party’s case and that entitles the party to judicial relief unless the opposing party presents evidence to the contrary. The plaintiff bears this initial burden of proof. If the plaintiff fails to present a prima facie case, the court will probably dismiss his lawsuit; if the plaintiff presents a prima facie case, then the defendant bears the burden of proof to disprove the plaintiff’s prima facie case. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-70\">The rules of evidence also specify the degree of proof required for a party to meet his burden of persuasion. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-preponderanceoftheevidence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-50\" role=\"doc-glossref\">preponderance of the evidence</span> is the degree of proof generally required in a civil action, which means that the decision as to an issue of fact must be supported by the greater weight of the evidence. The trier of fact considers which party’s evidence was more convincing. In a criminal action, the degree of proof required is higher.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-71\">The rules of evidence also include presumptions. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-presumption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-51\" role=\"doc-glossref\">presumption</span> is a rule of law under which a fact is assumed to be true because another fact or set of facts was proven. For example, if the facts surrounding a death indicate that the death could have resulted from either suicide or accident, the law in most jurisdictions presumes that the death was accidental.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-72\">A presumption can be either conclusive or rebuttable. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-conclusivepresumption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-52\" role=\"doc-glossref\">conclusive presumption</span> is a presumption that cannot be refuted. The law contains very few conclusive presumptions, most of which apply to criminal and not civil actions. By comparison, a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-rebuttablepresumption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-53\" role=\"doc-glossref\">rebuttable presumption</span>is a presumption that can be disproven but that stands until adequate evidence is presented to the contrary. The burden of proof shifts from one party to another because one party presents a rebuttable presumption, which will stand unless the other party produces evidence to disprove that presumption. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-73\">For example, an insurer denied a claim for life insurance policy proceeds on the ground that the insured died as a result of suicide during the suicide exclusion period. The beneficiary filed an action to recover the policy proceeds, presenting a <em>prima facie case</em> that the insured died while the policy was in force and that the death was accidental. The beneficiary’s evidence raised the <em>rebuttable presumption</em> that the insured’s death was accidental. As a result, the <em>burden of proof</em> shifted to the insurer, who was required to provide a <em>preponderance of the evidence</em> to convince the trier of fact that the death was a suicide and therefore not accidental.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-74\">Many legal issues arise from actions or transactions that involve more than one jurisdiction. In these cases, the courts must first determine which jurisdiction’s substantive laws apply to the case. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-conflictoflaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-54\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Conflict of laws</span> is the area of the law that determines which substantive laws apply to each issue in a case when the laws of more than one jurisdiction are involved in the action. Procedural rules in each jurisdiction around the world guide the courts in making conflict-of-laws determinations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-75\">A civil action is completed when the court issues a judgment. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-judgment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-55\" role=\"doc-glossref\">judgment</span> is an official decision of a court that resolves a litigated dispute and determines the rights and obligations of the parties to the action. Typically, the judgment incorporates the verdict of the trier of fact. However, if the judge in a jury trial finds that the jury’s verdict is based on insufficient evidence or is contrary to the law, then the judge may set aside the jury’s verdict and refuse to incorporate it into the judgment. If the parties agree to settle their dispute before the case is presented to the trier of fact, then the court usually dismisses the lawsuit, or incorporates their settlement agreement into the court’s judgment. Once the court issues a judgment, the judgment usually becomes part of the public record.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-76\">A losing party may have the right to appeal the judgment of the trial court. The right to appeal exists only where a statute grants that right, and in some cases, an appellate court must first grant a party permission to appeal. The party must file any appeals within the time limit prescribed by the applicable rules of procedure. The appeal can be based on issues of fact, issues of law, or both. Appellate courts have the power to affirm the judgment of a trial court, order a new trial, or change a trial court judgment in whole or in part.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-77\">If there is no appeal in a civil action, the judgment becomes final and binding on the parties, and the cause of action may not be the subject matter of a subsequent action. The finality of judgments is based on the judicial doctrine of res judicata. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-resjudicata\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-56\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Res judicata</span>, a Latin phrase meaning “a matter has been decided,” is a doctrine under which the judgment in a civil case becomes final and binding on the parties. The purpose of this doctrine is to ensure that parties will not relitigate matters that the courts have already decided. The doctrine thus promotes judicial efficiency and enables the parties to rely on the finality of judgments.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-33\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-78\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-34\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-79\">The court delivers a judgment in favor of the defendant, Median Life. If the decision is not subject to appeal, any question or fact that was raised or could have been raised in the original action is now barred by res judicata.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-35\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-4\">The Legal Process in Civil Law Jurisdictions</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-80\">The United States and Canada are unique in providing parties in criminal and civil cases the right to a jury trial. In civil law jurisdictions, although jury trials are available in some public (criminal) cases, private disputes typically are heard by a judge or panel of judges. A case involving a private dispute begins when the parties file pleadings, which state the issues in general terms. Where a case in a common law jurisdiction typically culminates in a trial, a case in a civil law jurisdiction usually proceeds with a series of meetings, hearings, and written documents through which evidence is presented. The judge guides the evidence-gathering process, questions all witnesses, and evaluates the admissibility and weight of all evidence presented. The judge renders the verdict at the final hearing on the matters.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch2-question-2-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch2-question-2\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-81\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch2-img-31\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch2-question-2-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-82\">In the course of a civil trial, a party may file a request to produce documents and things, which would require the other party to produce specifically defined documents and other items relevant to the dispute.

Recall that the legal definition of a tort states that the law provides a remedy to the wronged party. In the United States, each state has developed a body of tort law that creates rights and imposes corresponding duties on individuals, and apportions responsibility when a breach of a legal duty results in loss to another person. Although laws vary somewhat from state to state, we describe some of the general principles of tort law found in the laws of most states. Virtually all countries provide remedies to those who are injured by another person’s wrongful (tortious) actions as described in this section.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-95\">The law of torts focuses on compensating the victims of torts rather than on punishing the wrongdoers. An individual who breaches a legal duty that she owes to another person and thereby harms the other person is financially liable for the loss to the injured person. Whether an individual has met her legal duty depends on whether her conduct met the standard of care that the law requires.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-96\">The common law recognizes three general theories on which liability for tortious conduct can be based: intentional torts, negligence, and strict liability.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-51\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-3\">Intentional Torts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-97\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-intentionaltort\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-62\" role=\"doc-glossref\">intentional tort</span> is a private wrong committed by a person who intended to do something that the law declares a wrong. The common law imposes liability for a variety of specific intentional torts, which are either wrongs against another person or wrongs against another person’s property. Intentional torts against another person include assault, battery, defamation, fraudulent misrepresentation, and inducing a breach of contract. Intentional torts against another person’s property include trespass to land and conversion. The intentional torts most frequently relevant to insurance companies include defamation and fraudulent misrepresentation.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-52\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-5\">Specific Intentional Torts</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-98\">The tort of <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-defamation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-63\" role=\"doc-glossref\">defamation</span> occurs when a person makes false statements that injure the good name or reputation of another person. Defamation takes two forms: (1) <em>slander</em>, when the defamatory statements are made orally, and (2) <em>libel</em>, when the defamatory statements are made in writing. To succeed in a civil action for defamation, a plaintiff typically must prove that (1) the defendant made a false statement about the plaintiff, (2) the defendant communicated the statement to a third party, and (3) the statement injured the plaintiff’s reputation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-99\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-fraudulentmisrepresentation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-64\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Fraudulent misrepresentation</span> occurs when a person knowingly or willfully makes a false statement with the intent that another person will rely on the statement and will be harmed as a result of that reliance. To prove that a defendant knowingly or willfully made such a false statement, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a misrepresentation either (1) with knowledge of its falsity, (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) with reckless or careless disregard for whether it is true. In Chapter Four, we will discuss other misrepresentations that may or may not be intentional.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-53\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-6\">Elements of a Cause of Action</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-100\">The elements of a cause of action based on an intentional tort vary depending on the specific tort involved. To prevail in any cause of action based on an intentional tort, however, the plaintiff usually must prove that the defendant acted with intent. A defendant acts with intent when she desires to produce the results that follow from her wrongful act.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-54\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-4\">Negligence</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-101\">In most cases, liability in tort is the result of conduct that is considered negligent rather than conduct that is intentionally harmful. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-negligence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-65\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Negligence</span> is a private wrong committed by a person who failed to exercise the legally required degree of care in (1) doing something that is otherwise legally permissible or (2) omitting to do something that is otherwise legally required. For example, assume that a person is involved in a traffic accident. If the person was driving above the speed limit, he could be sued for negligence, because he was failing to exercise the legally required degree of care by driving cautiously.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-55\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-7\">Elements of a Cause of Action</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-102\">To prevail in a civil action based on negligence, a plaintiff generally has the burden of proving the following four elements of a cause of action:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-103\"><strong>The defendant had a legal duty to the plaintiff to act in accordance with a prescribed standard of care.</strong> Whether a defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff is a question of law for the court.

For example, the defendant may try to show that he did not owe the plaintiff a duty of care or that his actions were not the cause of the plaintiff’s loss. Even if a plaintiff’s injuries were the result of the defendant’s negligence, the defendant may be able to defeat the plaintiff’s claim in whole or in part with an affirmative defense such as contributory negligence or assumption of the risk.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-110\">The defense of<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-contributorynegligence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-68\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> contributory negligence</span> is available when the plaintiff’s own negligence contributed to her loss. According to the original common law rule of contributory negligence, a plaintiff who was responsible to any extent for her loss was denied any recovery from the defendant. To reduce the harshness of this rule, most states have modified their laws by adapting a system of <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-comparativenegligence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-69\" role=\"doc-glossref\">comparative negligence</span>, which apportions losses between plaintiffs and defendants when both parties’ negligence contributed to a plaintiff’s losses. With comparative negligence, a plaintiff who was contributorily negligent may recover from the defendant, but the amount of that recovery is reduced in proportion to the plaintiff’s fault. For example, assume that the trier of fact determines that a plaintiff was 20 percent at fault for her losses and the defendant was 80 percent at fault. The defendant will be held liable to the plaintiff for 80 percent of her losses. In some states, comparative negligence laws allow a plaintiff to recover from the defendant only if the defendant was 50 percent or more, or in other states more than 50 percent, at fault.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-111\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-assumptionoftherisk\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-70\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Assumption of the risk</span> is an affirmative defense that totally bars a plaintiff’s claim when the plaintiff understood the nature of the risk presented by the defendant’s conduct and voluntarily incurred that risk. For example, if a plaintiff was injured during a skydiving accident, the court might deny her claim on the basis that she was fully aware that skydiving is an inherently risky activity. Whether a plaintiff voluntarily assumed the risk is a question of fact.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-112\">Many states have abolished the common law defense of assumption of the risk by merging the rule into a system of comparative negligence. Some states have adopted laws of comparative fault that are similar to comparative negligence laws but are broader and include tortious conduct other than negligence, such as intentional torts.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-59\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-5\">Strict Liability</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-113\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-strictliability\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-71\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Strict liability</span>—that is, liability imposed by tort law without regard for whether the defendant was at fault—applies only in very restricted situations, such as when a defendant engages in extremely hazardous activities. For example, blasting with dynamite is a hazardous activity that may cause harm to others. A defendant is liable for losses caused by such activities even if the defendant was not negligent or otherwise at fault for the losses.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\"

If the plaintiff successfully wins her case, the remedies available vary depending on the nature of the plaintiff’s cause of action.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-127\">Common law jurisdictions generally categorize remedies as either legal or equitable. This categorization results from the way that England’s common law courts developed remedies. Originally, English courts followed rigid, formalized procedures that provided only limited and specific remedies, which came to be known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-legalremedies\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-80\" role=\"doc-glossref\">legal remedies</span>. These remedies primarily involved the payment of money damages to injured parties. Over time, legal remedies were inadequate to remedy some wrongs. The English government established separate courts, known as <em>courts of equity </em>or sometimes as<em> chancery courts</em>, to provide new remedies. The courts of equity were not bound by the existing rigid procedures and were given discretionary power to base their decisions on moral rights and concepts of justice. The remedies developed by the equity courts were known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-equitableremedies\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-81\" role=\"doc-glossref\">equitable remedies</span>. Today, the courts in common law jurisdictions are empowered to grant both legal and equitable remedies, although they may be separated into law and chancery divisions. We discuss remedies available to the parties to a life insurance contract in Chapter 13. </p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-72\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-6\">Legal Remedies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-128\">The basic legal remedy for most civil wrongs is <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-damages\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-82\" role=\"doc-glossref\">damages</span>, which consists of monetary compensation that may be recovered by a plaintiff who suffered a loss or injury as a result of a defendant’s wrongful conduct.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-73\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-9\">Compensatory Damages</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-129\">Civil damages awards generally provide a plaintiff with compensatory damages. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-compensatorydamages\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-83\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Compensatory damages</span>, also called <em>actual damages</em>, are damages intended to compensate an injured party for the amount of the monetary losses that resulted from the defendant’s wrongful conduct. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-130\">The amount of compensatory damages to be awarded a plaintiff is a question of fact. Once a defendant’s liability has been established, the trier of fact must determine the amount of damages to be awarded the plaintiff. The measure used for this decision varies depending on the specific facts of the case. In all cases, the plaintiff has the burden of proving with reasonable certainty the amount of her losses. In addition, a defendant generally is liable only for those losses that were the foreseeable result of his actions. A loss is foreseeable if it would ordinarily be expected to result from the wrongful actions or if the defendant knew of specific facts that would make the loss likely.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-131\">In an action for breach of contract, compensatory damages generally are measured as the <em>benefit of the bargain</em>. This damage award is that amount that will put the plaintiff in the financial position she would have been in if the contract had been performed.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-74\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-132\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-75\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-133\">The Balustrade Life Insurance Company purchased security software from Supermassive Cybersecurity Services. However, Balustrade suffered a breach in its cybersecurity when Supermassive failed to properly deploy a promised software upgrade in a timely fashion, as Supermassive was contractually obliged to do. Balustrade gave Supermassive several opportunities to correct the problem, but Supermassive failed to do so. As a result, Balustrade was forced to pay another vendor $800,000 to install a comparable software upgrade. Balustrade filed an action for breach of contract against Supermassive. The court found in favor of Balustrade and ordered Supermassive to pay Balustrade $800,000 in compensatory damages.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-134\">In an action based on a tort, compensatory damages generally include losses for personal injuries and/or property damage. Personal injury losses include physical, mental, and emotional injuries and typically consist of the amount of the plaintiff’s medical expenses and loss of earnings, including the loss of future earnings. Damage awards also include amounts to compensate the plaintiff for the pain and suffering that resulted from the defendant’s wrongful conduct.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-76\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-10\">Other Types of Damages</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-135\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-punitivedamages\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-84\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Punitive damages</span>, or <em>exemplary damages</em>, are damages awarded in addition to compensatory damages when a defendant’s wrongful conduct was malicious or willful. The purpose of a punitive damage award is to punish the defendant and to deter others from similar conduct. For instance, a court may award punitive damages in intentional tort cases and occasionally in cases based on negligence. An example of an intentional tort that might result in punitive damages for an insurer is fraudulent misrepresentation, such as if an insurer were to commit fraud by selling a policy under false claims. Punitive damages generally are <em>not</em> available in actions based on breach of contract unless the breach was wanton, willful, and deliberate.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-136\">Sometimes, a plaintiff is awarded <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-nominaldamages\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-85\" role=\"doc-glossref\">nominal damages</span> when she was wronged but she did not suffer a loss as a result of the wrong, she cannot prove the amount of the loss with reasonable certainty, or the loss was trivial. In such cases, the plaintiff is not entitled to compensatory damages, because she failed to prove the amount of her damages with reasonable certainty. If the defendant’s conduct was wrongful, however, the trier of fact may award the plaintiff a small sum. For example, assume that the defendant trespassed on the plaintiff’s land but did not damage the plaintiff in any measurable way. The trier of fact might award the plaintiff nominal damages of one dollar. Nominal damages may be awarded both in tort and contract actions.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-137\">The rules we have described are the most common rules concerning damages. The facts of each case determine the specific measure used to calculate the amount of damages that are awarded. Figure 2.2 describes some other types of damages that may be awarded in a civil action.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1275px;\" id=\"figure2-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-138\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-86\">Figure 2.2</span> Civil Damages</p> <img alt=\"Civil Damages\" id=\"loma311-ch2-img-92\" src=\"../../imgs/2-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-77\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure2-2\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-87\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-78\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure2-2\" id=\"loma311-ch2-a-16\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 2-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-79\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch2-h4-11\">Duty to Mitigate Damages</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-139\">The plaintiff in a civil action always has a duty to make a reasonable effort to <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-mitigate\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-88\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mitigate</span>—that is, to minimize—the amount of damages that result from the defendant’s wrong. The plaintiff cannot recover damages for a loss that she could have avoided or lessened by reasonable efforts. Thus, the plaintiff’s failure to mitigate damages is an affirmative defense to a civil action. The defendant may use the affirmative defense to reduce the amount of damages that he is required to pay.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-80\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-140\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-81\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-141\">Naseem Noor entered into an employment contract to create a software program for Long Nine LLC, which agreed to pay Naseem $20,000. Before Naseem began the project, Long Nine breached the contract by removing Naseem from the project and refusing to pay her. Naseem found other employment on a similar project, which paid only $17,000. If Naseem had been unable to find other employment, the amount of her loss would have been $20,000. Because she was able to mitigate her damages by earning $17,000, the amount of loss she actually suffered was $3,000.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-142\">Whether a party made reasonable efforts to mitigate his damages is a question of fact, and the trier of fact must decide whether the plaintiff made reasonable efforts to do so. If the plaintiff failed to make such reasonable efforts, then the trier of fact will reduce the amount of damages awarded to the plaintiff by the amount the plaintiff could have earned from other sources.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-82\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-143\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-83\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-144\">Naseem Noor brought an action for breach of contract against Long Nine LLC. Long Nine argued that the plaintiff failed to mitigate her damages by not looking for other work. If the trier of fact determines that Naseem could have reasonably found other employment that paid $18,000, then the amount of loss that she suffered from the breach of contract would be calculated as $2,000.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-84\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch2-h3-7\">Equitable Remedies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-145\">The English equity courts developed principles to aid them in determining when to grant an equitable remedy. According to these principles, to be granted equitable relief, a plaintiff in a civil action</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-146\"><strong>Must have no adequate remedy at law.</strong> In most cases, the legal remedy of damages is adequate to compensate a plaintiff’s losses. Equity intervenes only when damages do not adequately compensate a plaintiff.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-147\"><strong>Must come into court with clean hands.</strong> The purpose of equity is to do justice, and equity will not aid a party who has acted unfairly or dishonestly. As a result, equity will deny relief to any party who has unclean hands in the matter before the court. Unclean hands can consist of any conduct that equity considers to be unfair or unethical.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-85\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-148\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-86\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-149\"><strong>Example:</strong> In an 1892 case, a woman was convicted of murdering her husband. The woman assigned her rights as beneficiary under her husband’s life insurance policy to a third party, who attempted to collect the death benefit. The deceased’s executors filed an action, and the court ruled that it would be unfair for the woman to benefit from her crime.</p> </div> </div> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-150\"><strong>Must not be guilty of laches.</strong> <em>Laches</em> is a term derived from a word meaning “looseness” or “laxity.” A plaintiff is guilty of <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-laches\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-89\" role=\"doc-glossref\">laches</span> when she unreasonably delayed in pursuing a claim for relief and the defendant was harmed in some way as a result of the undue delay.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-151\">The courts have created additional equitable principles, and they have a great deal of discretion to fashion remedies and make decisions based on what is fair to the parties. The following equitable remedies may be available in a breach-of-contract action:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-53\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-152\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-reformation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-90\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Reformation</span> is an equitable remedy in which a written contract is rewritten to express the original agreement of the contracting parties. Reformation is available when the parties entered into a written contract but the document does not accurately reflect their agreement. If the parties cannot mutually agree to correct such a mistake, then one party may ask a court to correct the mistake and rewrite the contract. Whether the written contract accurately reflects the parties’ agreement is a question of fact.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-54\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-153\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-rescission\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-91\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Rescission</span> is an equitable remedy in which a contract is cancelled—or <em>rescinded</em>—and the parties are returned to the positions they would have been in had no contract ever been created. The remedy of rescission is of special importance to insurers. In Chapter 13 we describe situations in which a life insurance contract may be rescinded.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-55\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-154\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-specificperformance\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-92\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Specific performance</span> is an equitable remedy that requires a party who has breached a contract to carry out the contract according to its terms. Courts, for example, sometimes order specific performance of contracts for the sale of land. Because of the uniqueness of land, when the seller breaches such a contract, the buyer often suffers a loss that cannot be compensated with money damages, based on the buyer’s intended use for the land. Courts, however, will not order the specific performance of certain kinds of contracts, such as employment contracts.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-87\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Additional Equitable Remedies\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch2-img-93\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-155\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-88\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-156\">Additional Equitable Remedies</p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-89\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch2-div-90\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-56\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-declaratoryjudgment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-93\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Declaratory judgment</span>.

The basic purpose of restitution is to prevent unjust enrichment: A person should not be allowed to profit or be enriched as a result of a wrong committed at the expense of another person. Restitution is available in civil actions in which it is more appropriate to restore to the plaintiff what the defendant received than to award damages in the amount of the plaintiff’s losses. For example, assume that a person overpays an amount owed to another. The party who receives such an overpayment would be unjustly enriched if she keeps the amount overpaid and, thus, may be ordered to repay that amount. Similarly, the court would commonly order a person who wrongfully takes the property of another to return the property to its owner.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\"

As we noted, the parties are free to settle their dispute at any time, and they sometimes try to settle the matter by means of alternative dispute resolution methods. By <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-alternativedisputeresolutionmethods\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-106\" role=\"doc-glossref\">alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods</span> we mean any nonjudicial method of resolving civil disputes. For example, parties usually first try to settle their disputes themselves by means of formal or informal negotiations. We commonly refer to disputes resolved in this way as <em>settled out of court</em>. Mediation and arbitration are two other common forms of dispute resolution in the United States.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch2-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch2-li-58\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch2-p-171\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-mediation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-107\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Mediation</span> is a process in which an impartial third party, known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-mediator\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-108\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mediator</span>, facilitates negotiations between the parties in an effort to create a mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute.

Appeals of arbitrators’ decisions are generally possible only if the arbitration was conducted improperly. Contracts often require that any disputes that arise between the contracting parties be resolved through arbitration rather than through civil litigation.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-173\">Alternative dispute resolution methods are available in most countries, although the terminology varies and the specific operation of the procedures also varies. In many countries <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch2-gt-conciliation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch2-span-111\" role=\"doc-glossref\">conciliation</span> is a dispute resolution method that is similar to mediation in that the parties are encouraged to come to a mutually acceptable agreement; a third party facilitates the parties’ negotiations and helps them resolve the dispute themselves. If the parties are not able to resolve their dispute through conciliation, they typically have the right to resort to the courts. For example, in China, courts are required to promote the process of mediation for resolving civil disputes. Another variation in some countries is that the mediator’s role is to present a nonbinding solution that the parties are encouraged to accept.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch2-question-8-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch2-question-8\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-174\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch2-img-130\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch2-question-8-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch2-p-175\">Mr. Avez and Ms. Ballard chose to resolve their dispute out of court.

In the United States, the primary forms of business organizations are sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations. U.S. laws permit a variety of different hybrid forms of partnerships and corporations, each with unique advantages and disadvantages. Examples of such business organizations include the limited partnership (LP), limited liability partnership (LLP), limited liability company (LLC), professional corporation (PC), S-corporation, and C-corporation. For insurers the corporation is the ideal form of business organization. To understand why, we first look at sole proprietorships and general partnerships.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-35\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-31\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-soleproprietorship\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">sole proprietorship</span> is a business that is owned and operated by one individual, who is known as the sole proprietor.

The corporation’s debts and liabilities belong to the corporation itself. The owners are not personally responsible for the corporation’s debts. Instead, the personal liability of an owner for the corporation’s debts generally is limited to the amount of the owner’s investment in the corporation.

Such stability makes the corporation the ideal form of business organization for insurance companies.

A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-stockinsurancecompany\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">stock insurance company</span> is an insurance company owned by its stockholders. A stock company also may be classified according to how its stock is sold. Large corporations, including many insurers, are publicly traded corporations. A <em>publicly traded corporation</em> is a corporation whose stock is available for sale to the general public. By contrast, a <em>close corporation</em>, or <em>closely held corporation</em>, is a corporation that has issued stock that is owned by a relatively small group of people, often members of the same family. The stock of a close corporation is not available for sale to the general public.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-44\">Although most insurers are publicly traded stock companies, some are established differently. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-mutualinsurancecompany\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mutual insurance company</span> is an insurance company that is owned by its policyowners, the parties who own insurance policies issued by the company.

It provides its members with social and insurance benefits. As such, a fraternal insurer may not be required to become a corporation.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-23\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-2\">Incorporation Requirements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-46\">To incorporate a business (including a life insurance company) in the United States, a required number of adults usually must file specified documents with a state administrative agency. The people who file these documents are called the <em>incorporators</em>. In most states, the documents are filed with the secretary of state’s office or the corporation commission. The primary document generally filed is the corporation’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-articlesofincorporation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">articles of incorporation</span>, a document that describes some of the essential features of the corporation. The following information usually must be included in the articles of incorporation:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-47\"><strong>The names and addresses of the incorporators.</strong> </p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-48\"><strong>The name of the proposed corporation.</strong> Each corporation must have a unique name. This name cannot be the same as or deceptively similar to the name of any other domestic corporation. To let the public know that the business is incorporated, the name also must include one of these words (or an abbreviation of one): <em>corporation</em>, <em>incorporated</em>, <em>company</em>, or <em>limited</em>.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-49\"><strong>The street address of the corporation’s registered office and the name of the corporation’s registered agent at that address.</strong> The <em>registered agent</em> is the person the corporation has appointed as its agent within the state for purposes of service of process. As we saw in Chapter 2, service of process is the act of delivering—or serving—a complaint to a defendant in a civil lawsuit.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-50\"><strong>For a stock company, the number of shares of stock that the corporation is authorized to issue.</strong> The number of shares would be determined based on the corporation’s value and the price per share. The individuals and businesses that buy the corporation’s stock become the owners of the corporation.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-51\">Unless the articles of incorporation indicate otherwise, the corporation’s existence begins when the articles of incorporation are filed with the state agency. If the corporation meets the incorporation requirements, the state issues a certificate of incorporation. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-certificateofincorporation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-22\" role=\"doc-glossref\">certificate of incorporation</span>, or <em>corporate charter</em>, is a document issued by a state agency that grants a corporation its legal existence and its right to operate as a corporation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-52\">In the United States, an insurer must select a state in which to incorporate. That state is then the insurer’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-domicile\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-23\" role=\"doc-glossref\">domicile</span> or <em>domiciliary state</em>.

From both Iowa’s and New Jersey’s point of view, Blue Mountain is an <em>alien</em> insurer.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-59\">In contrast to the United States, most other countries classify insurers as either domestic or foreign. In these countries, a <em>domestic insurer</em> is incorporated within the country and a <em>foreign insurer</em> is incorporated under the laws of another country.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-26\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-60\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-27\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-61\">Radius Life Insurance Company is incorporated in Canada and also does business in India.

However, additional requirements apply. The state insurance department typically must approve the formation of the corporation as part of the incorporation process. By incorporating in a state, an insurer subjects itself to the jurisdiction of that state’s insurance department.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-63\">Each state insurance department has primary responsibility for overseeing the operations of its domestic insurers. Insurance departments also have oversight responsibility for insurers incorporated outside their state that operate within their state. Thus, each state insurance department supervises the operations of domestic insurers as well as foreign and alien insurers operating in the state.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-64\">All states require that before transacting business within the state, an insurer must obtain a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-certificateofauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-27\" role=\"doc-glossref\">certificate of authority</span>, or <em>license</em>, which is a document issued by the state insurance department that grants the insurer the right to conduct insurance business in the state. This licensing requirement enables the insurance department to examine the insurer’s finances and ability to pay policy benefits. The requirement also enables the department to oversee the insurer’s operations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-65\">An insurer must obtain a certificate of authority from each state in which it plans to do business and must conduct business in the state in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements. When an insurer receives a certificate of authority, the insurer becomes subject to the jurisdiction of that state’s insurance department.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-66\">Because insurers must comply with the laws in all jurisdictions where they operate, compliance can be costly and burdensome. One way states attempt to make laws more uniform and less burdensome is by adopting model laws. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-modellaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-28\" role=\"doc-glossref\">model law</span>, sometimes called a <em>model act</em> or a <em>uniform law</em>, is a sample law created and adopted by a national or international organization of regulators, lawmakers, lawyers, and/or academics. The organization encourages legislatures to enact laws based on the model. A model law is only a proposed law. To become effective, the law must be enacted by a legislature.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-67\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-nationalassociationofinsurancecommissioners\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-29\" role=\"doc-glossref\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)</span> is a nonprofit association of the insurance commissioners of all U.S. states and territories. A primary function of the NAIC is to promote uniformity of state regulation by developing model insurance laws and regulations. Although insurance laws vary by state, some uniformity exists because many state laws are based on NAIC model laws. The NAIC makes its model laws, regulations, and guidelines available on its website.<span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-30\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch3-en1\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-31\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</span> </span> </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-68\">For a state insurance department to be accredited by the NAIC, the state must, among other things, adopt certain laws regarding financial standards and oversight that are substantially similar to those put forth by the NAIC. A state’s NAIC accreditation is important for insurers domiciled in that state because it allows insurance departments in other states where the insurer operates to rely on the domiciliary state’s oversight as primary.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-69\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-naicuniformcertificateofauthorityapplication\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">NAIC Uniform Certificate of Authority Application (UCAA)</span> is a standardized application created by the NAIC that allows an insurer to submit the same application to all states where it intends to do business. Thus, the insurer does not have to submit a different application to each insurance department. However, the specific requirements for a certificate of authority vary by state. The states conduct independent reviews and accept or reject applications separately. Along with the application for a certificate of authority, an insurer usually must submit its certificate of incorporation and bylaws. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-bylaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-33\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Bylaws</span> are the basic rules under which a corporation operates.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Such organizations generally are known as <em>corporations</em> or <em>companies</em>, depending on the jurisdiction. They typically have the following characteristics in common with U.S. corporations:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-56\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-71\">The business exists as a legal entity that is separate from its owners. It has the legal rights and liabilities of a natural person, including the right to sue and be sued and the right to own property.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-57\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-72\">The owners of the business have limited liability for the debts of the business.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-58\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-73\">The business continues to exist beyond the death of its owners. In some countries, however, the business has a life of only a specific number of years. For example, a corporation in the Philippines has a 50-year lifetime, after which time the corporation can be renewed for another 50 years.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-59\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-74\">A board of directors, described in the following section, is responsible for managing the affairs of the business.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-60\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-75\">The owners (typically stockholders) have the right to make certain important decisions for the business.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-76\">Laws around the world also contain some features that differ from U.S. laws with regard to corporations. Examples of such differences include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-77\">Some countries impose minimum capital requirements for all corporations. In the United States, insurance and financial services companies must meet minimum capital requirements, but most other types of U.S. businesses are not subject to such requirements.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-62\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-78\">Some countries, such as India, recognize two forms of companies that provide their owners with limited liability. In these countries, an owner’s liability may be either limited by shares or limited by guarantee. A <em>company limited by shares</em> is a company whose owners’ liability is limited to their investment in the company’s stock. A <em>company limited by guarantee</em> is a company whose owners agree to pay up to a stated amount if the company is liquidated.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-63\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-79\">Some countries have created state-owned businesses, which are operated by the government for the benefit of the people. These countries include China, Malaysia, and Mexico.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-80\">Most countries permit foreign companies to operate within their borders. To do so the foreign company must meet certain requirements. For instance, the company might be required to take one of the following approaches:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-64\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-81\">Incorporate a business in the host country that operates as a subsidiary of the foreign company.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-65\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-82\">Open a branch in the host country that is properly registered with the host government.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-66\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-83\">Enter into a joint venture with a local company. A <em>joint venture</em> is an arrangement between two or more otherwise independent businesses that agree to undertake a specific project together for a specified time period. In some countries, the amount that a foreign company may invest in a local business is subject to regulatory limits.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-84\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-multinationalcorporation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">multinational corporation</span> is a corporation that operates in more than one country and makes major decisions within a global context. Multinationals operate across jurisdictions and face unique legal and regulatory issues because they must comply with the laws and regulations of their home country and each country in which they do business. In some cases, multinationals also must comply with international treaties and regulatory agreements. Figure 3.1 shows a few of the many treaties and agreements that apply to businesses.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1107px;\" id=\"figure3-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-85\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-35\">Figure 3.1</span> International Treaties and Agreements</p> <img alt=\"International Treaties and Agreements\" id=\"loma311-ch3-img-34\" src=\"../../imgs/3-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-29\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure3-1\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-36\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-30\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure3-1\" id=\"loma311-ch3-a-16\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 3-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch3-question-2-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch3-question-2\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-86\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch3-img-35\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch3-question-2-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-87\">True/False: Corporations have two primary features that make them the ideal form of business organization for insurers.

In addition, a domestic corporation’s organization and operation are governed by statutes imposed by the state in which it is incorporated.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-112\">All corporations, including insurers, must demonstrate effective corporate governance. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-corporategovernance\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-44\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Corporate governance</span> is a framework of rules and processes for directing and controlling a corporation that emphasizes integrity, transparency, and balancing the interests of stakeholders while fulfilling strategic goals. In the United States, the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-naiccorporategovernanceannualdisclosureact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-45\" role=\"doc-glossref\">NAIC Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Act</span>(also called the <em>Corporate Governance Model Act</em>) requires an insurer to provide information regarding corporate governance practices to its state of domicile annually by June 1. The information provided by an insurer is called the <em>corporate governance annual disclosure.</em> </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-113\">In a broad sense, three groups are involved in the governance of a corporation. These groups are (1) the board of directors, (2) the officers of the corporation, and (3) the stockholders.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-43\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-3\">Board of Directors</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-114\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-directors\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Directors</span> are individuals who are appointed or elected by the stockholders or policyholders to manage and direct the affairs of a corporation. State law may also provide for board seats appointed by members of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the state government. Collectively, the directors are known as the corporation’s <em>board of directors</em>. Directors who are otherwise employed by the corporation or are major stockholders of the corporation are known as <em>inside directors</em>, and typically are officers of the corporation. Directors who are not otherwise employed by or have no significant direct interest in the corporation are referred to as <em>outside directors</em>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-115\">Actions of a board are legally binding on the corporation if they are the result of a legal vote by at least a quorum of the board members. A <em>quorum</em> is a specified percentage of an entire body, in this case, a board of directors. State laws and corporate articles of incorporation or bylaws may establish the number or percentage of directors who must be present to constitute a quorum. In the absence of such controlling authority, a simple majority of directors constitutes a quorum.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-116\">Boards of directors typically meet at scheduled times. They must meet at least once a year. A board of directors may act without an in-person meeting if all directors consent to the action in writing.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-44\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch3-h4-2\">Duties of Directors</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-117\">A corporation’s directors have ultimate responsibility for managing and overseeing the corporation’s affairs. The directors exercise this responsibility by delegating their authority. For example, directors are responsible for appointing the corporation’s officers. The directors then have a duty to ensure that the officers manage the corporation lawfully and competently. Directors must have at least a basic understanding of the business that the corporation conducts. They also have a duty to keep informed about the corporation’s affairs.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-118\">Directors are fiduciaries who are obligated to act in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-fiduciary\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">fiduciary</span> is an entity or individual who holds a special position of trust or confidence when handling the affairs of another and who must put the other’s interests above the fiduciary’s own. As fiduciaries, directors have the following duties:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-18\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-73\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-119\"><strong>Duty of loyalty and good faith. <em>Good faith</em> </strong> is the honest intent to act without taking unfair advantage of another person. A director must act in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation and the stockholders. A director must not misuse corporate assets or take a corporate opportunity for personal benefit. A director must fully disclose any conflicts of interest and should abstain from voting on matters that could involve a conflict of interest.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-120\"><strong>Duty to exercise due care in carrying out responsibilities.</strong> A director must use that degree of care that an ordinarily prudent person would use in carrying out her own affairs. Typically, because insurers occupy a special position of public trust, their directors are held to a higher standard of care than are directors of other types of businesses. Whether a director has exercised due care in a situation is a question of fact. Although directors have a duty to use due care, they also have a right to rely on information they receive from the company’s officers and employees whom the directors reasonably believe are reliable and competent to provide the information. If a director’s review of the corporation’s affairs would raise questions in the mind of a <em>reasonably prudent person</em>, then the director has a duty to inquire further. This type of duty is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-reasonablepersonstandard\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-48\" role=\"doc-glossref\">reasonable person standard</span>, which is a standard applied in objective tests in which a party’s actions or understanding is compared to the actions or understanding of a hypothetical reasonable person in the party’s position.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-45\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch3-h4-3\">Liability of Directors</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-121\">Directors may be held legally liable if they violate—or breach—their fiduciary duties. However, U.S. courts generally provide some protection against such personal liability by applying the business judgment rule. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-businessjudgmentrule\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-49\" role=\"doc-glossref\">business judgment rule</span>states that directors will not be held personally liable for making business decisions if there is a reasonable basis to believe that the directors acted in good faith and with due care. On the other hand, directors generally will be personally liable if they </p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-19\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-122\"><strong>Act in bad faith.</strong> Essentially the opposite of good faith, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-badfaith\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-50\" role=\"doc-glossref\">bad faith</span>occurs when a person acts with a dishonest motive by knowingly committing a wrong or failing to fulfill a legal duty. </p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-123\"><strong>Abuse their discretion.</strong> Directors abuse their discretion when their actions are not reasonably justified or are clearly not reasonable, given the circumstances.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-124\"><strong>Are guilty of gross negligence. <em>Gross negligence </em> </strong>occurs when a person, through action or inaction, consciously and voluntarily fails to perform a legal duty in reckless disregard of the consequences of that failure.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-125\"><strong>Commit fraud. <em>Fraud</em> </strong> is an act by which someone intentionally deceives another party and induces that other party to part with something of value or to give up a legal right.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-46\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-4\">Officers</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-126\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-officers\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-51\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Officers</span> of a corporation are the people responsible for carrying out important management functions for the operation of the corporation. Officers may include the CEO, president, and treasurer, to name a few. A corporation’s board of directors usually appoints the top-level officers in accordance with applicable state laws and the corporation’s articles of incorporation and bylaws. Such appointed officers often are authorized to appoint additional officers.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-127\">Corporate officers are fiduciaries who are obligated to act in the best interests of the corporation and its stockholders. Officers have a duty of loyalty and a duty to exercise due care in carrying out their responsibilities. In addition, laws in some states require officers to disclose all relevant information to the board of directors. In this way the board is fully informed before making decisions on behalf of the corporation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-128\">Officers are almost always employees of the corporation. They often enter into employment contracts and related types of agreements. Such a contract often imposes additional duties on the officers, who may be held legally liable to the corporation for violating these duties.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-129\">Like directors, officers may be personally liable if they breach their duties and obligations to the corporation. Unlike directors, officers generally are not afforded protection under the business judgment rule. They may be personally liable for acts that are negligent. Recall that directors may be liable for <em>gross negligence</em>, which involves an element of willful misconduct. By contrast, the legal standard for officers is <em>negligent conduct</em>, which involves only an element of inattention or thoughtlessness in acting or failing to act.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-47\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-5\">Stockholders</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-130\">The stockholders exercise ultimate control over a stock corporation’s management because they have the right to elect the board of directors. They also have other ownership rights in the corporation, including the right to</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-20\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-131\"><strong>Inspect the corporation’s financial records, books, and papers.</strong> This right is limited to inspections that are carried out in good faith and with a proper and honest purpose.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-80\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-132\"><strong>Attend annual stockholder meetings and vote on certain important corporate matters.</strong> Stockholders have the right to vote on matters such as whether the corporation should be dissolved or merged with another corporation. Stockholders also have the right to change the corporation’s bylaws, which typically are adopted by the corporation’s board of directors and may later be changed by the directors or the stockholders.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-81\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-133\"><strong>Share in the corporation’s profits when dividends are declared.</strong> A <em>dividend</em> is a payment of a portion of the corporation’s profits to the corporation’s owners. A corporation’s board of directors must authorize the payment of dividends, which are paid from the corporation’s surplus.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-134\">Note that for a mutual company, the policyowners may have all or some of these rights.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Such changes can provide new sources of capital, create new uses for existing capital, or refocus corporate strategy. For example, a mutual insurer may change to a stock insurer through a process called <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-demutualization\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-52\" role=\"doc-glossref\">demutualization</span>. Or a stock insurer may change to a mutual insurer through a process called <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-mutualization\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-53\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mutualization</span>. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-136\">Two other types of transactions, known as mergers and acquisitions, result in change in the controlling interest in a corporation.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-21\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-82\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-137\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-merger\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-54\" role=\"doc-glossref\">merger</span> is a transaction in which one corporation is absorbed into another corporation by combining its assets and liabilities with those of the surviving corporation. The merged corporation ceases to exist after it is liquidated. Thus, only one corporation survives the merger transaction.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-83\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-138\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-acquisition\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-55\" role=\"doc-glossref\">acquisition</span> is a transaction in which one corporation purchases a controlling interest in another corporation, resulting in a linkage between formerly independent corporations. After the transaction, both corporations survive as separate legal entities. Occasionally, an acquisition can lead to a merger.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-139\">Like mutualization and demutualization, mergers and acquisitions require input and advice from a range of experts. Legal and compliance professionals make key contributions in this process because federal and state laws regulate the transactions. Some of the regulatory issues that companies must address are</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-22\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-84\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-140\">The issuing corporation must comply with federal and state securities laws when stock will be issued as part of the transaction.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-85\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-141\">Regulatory approvals must be obtained before the transactions are completed. For example, a transaction in which one entity will either acquire or merge with a U.S. insurer usually requires the approval of the insurance department of the insurer’s domiciliary state.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-86\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-142\">U.S. antitrust laws may prohibit the transaction if it is deemed to lessen competition. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-antitrustlaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-56\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Antitrust laws</span>, called <em>competition laws</em> in many countries, protect commerce against the monopolization of market power and unlawful restraints of trade such as price discrimination and price fixing. Depending on the circumstances, companies considering a merger or acquisition must file documents with specified government agencies. The agencies review the filings to ensure that the transaction does not violate antitrust laws. We discuss antitrust laws later in this chapter.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch3-question-5-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\"

A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-holdingcompanysystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-64\" role=\"doc-glossref\">holding company system</span>is a corporate ownership structure in which one company—the <em>holding company</em>—owns and controls another company (or companies), known as a <em>subsidiary</em> of the holding company. In such an arrangement, each company exists as a separate corporate entity. Companies under the common control of a holding company are known as <em>affiliates</em>. </p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-58\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-6\">Insurance Holding Companies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-156\">In the United States, all states have laws to regulate companies that are part of an insurance holding company system. Most of these laws are based in whole or in part on the <em>NAIC Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (Model Holding Company Act)</em>. Laws based on the Model Holding Company Act define an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-insuranceholdingcompanysystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-65\" role=\"doc-glossref\">insurance holding company system</span> as two or more affiliated corporations, one or more of which is an insurer. The laws are designed to protect an insurer’s policyowners from the possibility that a holding company might make business decisions that could put insurance coverage at risk. The laws also prevent a holding company system from separating an insurer’s assets and liabilities from that insurer’s control. Following are some of the requirements of state insurance holding company laws:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-23\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-87\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-157\">The insurance department of the insurer’s domiciliary state must approve any transaction in which an entity will acquire control of or merge with an insurer. Approval generally is granted unless the insurance department makes any of these determinations: (1) the insurer’s financial stability would be threatened, (2) the transaction is unfair to the insurer’s policyowners, or (3) competition in insurance would be lessened substantially.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-88\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-158\">To protect an insurer’s financial stability, the amount that an insurer may invest in subsidiaries is limited.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-89\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-159\">Transactions between companies affiliated with an insurer must be reported to the insurance department of the insurer’s domiciliary state. The insurance department will disapprove a transaction if the terms of the transaction are unreasonable or would threaten the insurer’s finances and ability to pay policy benefits.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-90\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-160\">Domestic insurers that are part of a holding company system are subject to registration and periodic filing and reporting requirements. These requirements are designed to enable insurance departments to oversee the operations of insurance holding company systems.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-59\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-7\">Financial Holding Companies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-161\">In the United States, a financial institution that provides a full range of financial services must qualify as a financial holding company. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-financialholdingcompany\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-66\" role=\"doc-glossref\">financial holding company (FHC)</span>is a holding company that conducts activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities, such as insurance, securities, banking, and investment and advisory services. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-162\">An FHC must include a depository institution, which may be a national, state, foreign, or savings bank. The process to become an FHC is regulated by the Federal Reserve System. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-federalreservesystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-67\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Federal Reserve System (the Fed)</span> is a system consisting of 12 regional banks, all national banks, and most state banks. These banks are known as Fed members. The Fed has a number of primary functions. It conducts the nation’s monetary policy, maintains the stability of the nation’s financial system, and provides certain financial services to the U.S. government, the public, and financial institutions. The Fed also supervises and regulates banking institutions and protects the credit rights of consumers. Although the Fed focuses primarily on banking activities, it does provide oversight of financial holding companies and thus some insurance companies. If an insurer is included in an FHC, then the FHC also must comply with state insurance holding company laws.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Governments promote competition because it encourages the efficient use of economic resources and tends to keep down the costs of producing goods and services. By keeping down production costs, competition also keeps down prices. For any product, the market operates somewhere on a continuum that ranges from pure competition to pure monopoly.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-24\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-91\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-164\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-purecompetition\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-68\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Pure competition</span> means there are many producers and consumers of the product, and prices are established by market forces with no interference from outside economic forces. In theory, pure competition results in the production of the greatest output of a product at the lowest price. In reality, no market operates in a state of pure competition.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-92\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-165\">In a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-monopoly\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-69\" role=\"doc-glossref\">monopoly</span>, one firm, or a group of firms acting together, controls the production and distribution of a product. Under a monopoly, there is no competition. With no competition, prices tend to increase and producers are less responsive to consumer demand.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-166\">Antitrust laws are designed to promote competition in the marketplace and prevent monopolies and other specified business practices that unfairly restrain trade. In other words, antitrust laws seek to enable the markets to operate as closely to a state of pure competition as possible. These laws ensure that markets are free and open. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-freeandopenmarket\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-70\" role=\"doc-glossref\">free and open market</span> is a market in which prices are established by market forces with little or no intervention from the government or other powerful economic entities, such as monopolies.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-167\">The insight below explains why employees of life insurance companies must be aware of antitrust laws.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-60\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Antitrust Laws and Insurance Company Employees\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch3-img-81\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-168\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-61\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-169\">Antitrust Laws and Insurance Company Employees</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-170\">Although antitrust regulations often apply to activities at the corporate level, it is possible for virtually anyone in a company to violate antitrust regulations. For example, industry professionals must be careful about the kind of information they share outside the organization. Even a casual conversation may give the appearance that competitors are sharing information in violation of federal antitrust laws.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-171\">Whether employees can share information with competitors depends on how the information is classified. Public information—which includes information about product features—can be shared. On the other hand, nonpublic information—for instance, information about a marketing strategy or product pricing—should not be shared.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-62\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-8\">U.S. Antitrust Regulation</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-172\">In the United States, the state and federal governments have enacted antitrust laws. State laws regulate activities that occur <em>within</em> a given state. Federal laws regulate commerce <em>between</em> states and are the primary source of antitrust regulation. The main federal antitrust laws are the</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-25\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-93\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-173\"><strong>Sherman Act</strong>, which prohibits individuals and companies from (1) monopolizing or attempting to monopolize any part of interstate or foreign trade or (2) engaging in contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-94\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-174\"><strong>Clayton Act</strong>, which prohibits certain actions that lessen competition and lead to monopolies</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-95\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-175\"><strong>Federal Trade Commission Act</strong>, which established the Federal Trade Commission and gave it the power to enforce federal antitrust laws; the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-federaltradecommission\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-71\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</span> is an independent administrative agency of the federal government responsible for enforcing federal antitrust laws as well as federal consumer protection laws (described later in this chapter)</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-176\">The federal antitrust laws are written in very broad terms. They allow the courts to decide what specific activities are illegal based on the facts and circumstances of each case. The courts have identified certain activities that are so harmful to consumers that they are conclusively presumed to violate the antitrust laws. Such prohibited activities are called <em>per se violations</em>. Examples of per se violations include agreements among competitors to</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-26\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-96\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-177\">Divide markets by allocating customers, suppliers, or territories.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-97\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-178\">Fix prices or output;<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-pricefixing\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-72\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> price fixing</span> occurs when competitors act together to affect the price of a product or service.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-98\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-179\">Rig bids; in situations in which purchasers obtain goods or services by soliciting competing bids, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-bidrigging\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-73\" role=\"doc-glossref\">bid rigging</span> occurs when competitors agree in advance who will submit the winning bid and thus raise prices.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-180\">The courts evaluate all cases that are not per se violations under a rule of reason analysis. A <em>rule of reason analysis</em> evaluates the overall competitive effect of the parties’ conduct. It weighs the competitive harm against the competitive benefits. The specific analysis used varies depending on the facts of each case.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-63\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch3-h4-4\">Specific Prohibitions</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-181\">The goal of antitrust laws is not to prohibit all monopolies, but to prevent illegal monopolies. An <em>illegal monopoly</em> exists when a business engages in anticompetitive conduct to control the market for a product or service. In other words, the business obtained its power through unfair competition or dishonest practices. Anticompetitive tactics include those that unreasonably exclude businesses from the market or that significantly impair others’ ability to compete in a market—for example, through price fixing or price discrimination.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-182\">Some monopolies are legal. A business that gained monopoly power through fair competition and legitimate tactics has not violated the antitrust laws. For instance, a company can gain a monopoly by being the only business that is able or willing to provide a specific product.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-183\">Certain activities are prohibited by federal antitrust laws when the activities are part of an agreement between competing businesses. Here are some examples of such prohibited agreements between competitors:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-27\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-99\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-184\">Competitors may not enter into an agreement to divide up a market by geographical territory or by customers. Such agreements are per se violations because they essentially are agreements not to compete in a given market.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-100\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-185\">Competitors may not agree to restrict the output or production of products. Such restrictions tend to drive up prices.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-101\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-186\">Competitors may not enter into agreements to (1) set minimum or maximum prices for goods or services, (2) limit the production of goods or services so as to affect the price, or (3) eliminate competitive bidding.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-187\">Antitrust laws also prohibit some agreements between parties in a buyer-seller relationship. For example, it is a violation for a manufacturer and a retailer to agree on the fixed minimum resale price of a product. Figure 3.2 shows some other practices that are prohibited by U.S. antitrust laws.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:931px;\" id=\"figure3-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-188\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-74\">Figure 3.2</span> Practices Prohibited by U.S. Antitrust Laws</p> <img alt=\"Practices Prohibited by U.S. Antitrust Laws\" id=\"loma311-ch3-img-82\" src=\"../../imgs/3-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-64\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure3-2\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-75\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-65\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure3-2\" id=\"loma311-ch3-a-22\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 3-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-66\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch3-h4-5\">Enforcement Procedures</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-189\">Both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FTC are authorized to enforce federal antitrust laws. The two agencies generally consult before they begin an antitrust investigation and decide which agency will take primary responsibility for handling the case. Note, however, that antitrust issues are prosecuted through the DOJ. The insight below describes one of the many responsibilities shared by the DOJ and the FTC to enforce federal antitrust laws.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-67\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Regulatory Review of Mergers and Acquisitions\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch3-img-83\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-190\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-68\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-191\">Regulatory Review of Mergers and Acquisitions</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-192\">Some mergers and acquisitions may benefit competition by creating stronger competitors with a more efficient cost structure. Others may lessen competition because they create monopoly power. Federal law requires that parties to certain mergers or acquisitions notify the FTC and the DOJ before completing the proposed transaction. Whether a particular transaction must be reported depends on the value of the acquisition and the size of the parties, as measured by their sales and assets. Also, other acquisitions that are likely to raise antitrust concerns must be reported.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-193\">After notification, the FTC and DOJ have a stated period of time in which to evaluate the proposed transaction. The agencies’ evaluation is aimed at determining whether the transaction would substantially concentrate market power and make it difficult for new firms to enter the market. If the FTC or DOJ believes that a proposed transaction violates the antitrust laws, they may seek an injunction in federal district court to prohibit the parties from completing the transaction.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-194\">Various legal sanctions may be imposed against individuals and businesses that violate federal antitrust laws. Some violations are crimes that are handled by the DOJ and punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. Civil penalties, including substantial fines, also may be imposed. A person who has been harmed by a violation of federal antitrust laws has the right to file a lawsuit in federal court against the businesses or individuals who committed the violation. A plaintiff who is successful in such a lawsuit is entitled to recover from the defendants <em>treble damages</em>—an amount equal to three times the actual damages—plus reasonable attorneys’ fees.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-69\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-9\">International Antitrust Regulation</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-195\">Most countries outside the United States have enacted antitrust laws. For instance, in Canada the <em>Competition Act</em> is a federal law that governs most business conduct to prevent anticompetitive market practices. Although the details of antitrust laws vary by jurisdiction, the same types of activities prohibited in the United States generally are prohibited in other nations. However, U.S. antitrust laws are unique in these ways:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-28\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-102\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-196\">As a general rule, no other country has antitrust laws that are as strict as those in the United States. Also, the United States enforces its antitrust laws more vigorously than do most other countries.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-103\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-197\">Other countries generally do not try to regulate anticompetitive conduct when it occurs beyond their geographic borders. With regard to the United States, anticompetitive conduct that affects domestic or foreign commerce may violate the U.S. antitrust laws regardless of where such conduct occurs or the nationality of the parties involved.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-104\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-198\">Violations of most countries’ antitrust laws may lead to fines, but typically are not considered crimes punishable by imprisonment as in the United States.</p> </li> </ul> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

For most regulatory purposes, a <em>consumer</em> is a natural person who purchases or tries to purchase goods or services primarily for personal, family, or household use. Businesses, such as insurers and companies that purchase group insurance, generally are not considered consumers. Thus, transactions between businesses are not governed by consumer protection laws, but by other laws. Common consumer protection laws include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-29\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-105\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-200\"><strong>Laws that prohibit deceptive and unfair sales practices.</strong> These laws are designed to provide consumers with fair and accurate information about goods and services during the sales process.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-106\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-201\"><strong>Laws that prohibit false, deceptive, and misleading advertising.</strong> These laws are designed to protect consumers by ensuring that advertisements are truthful and are reasonably clear to the average person.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-107\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-202\"><strong>Consumer credit laws.</strong> These laws require providers of consumer credit—such as banks, finance companies, and credit card companies—to disclose all the terms of a consumer credit transaction and to use properly any personal information obtained about consumers. The intent is to promote the informed use of credit and to protect consumers’ privacy.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-108\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-203\"><strong>Consumer product safety laws.</strong> These laws require consumer products designed for personal, family, and household use to meet minimum health and safety standards.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-204\">Most jurisdictions have general consumer protection laws that apply to all types of businesses. Other laws apply specifically to certain types of businesses. Many such general and specific laws apply to insurers. In this section, we describe just a few of the <em>general consumer protection laws</em> that apply to insurers operating in the United States.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-70\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-10\">Consumer Protections and Disclosures</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-205\">Federal and state laws protect consumers who enter into credit transactions in which they purchase goods or services and finance those purchases over time. One of the broadest federal laws is the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-consumercreditprotectionact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-76\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Consumer Credit Protection Act </span>regulates many aspects of how businesses provide credit to consumers in the United States. The act requires that creditors</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-30\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-109\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-206\">Provide consumers with certain written disclosures concerning all finance charges and related aspects of credit transactions.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-110\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-207\">Adhere to restrictions on the garnishment of a debtor’s wages. <em>Garnishment</em> is a legal process by which a creditor can obtain a debtor’s property that is in the possession of a third party. For example, certain creditors are able to garnish the wages of a debtor, which means the debtor’s employer is required to pay a specific portion of the debtor’s wages to the creditor in payment of the debt.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-111\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-208\">Refrain from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age when they extend credit.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-71\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch3-h4-6\">Fair Credit Reporting Act</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-209\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-faircreditreportingact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-77\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</span> regulates the reporting and use of consumer credit information and seeks to ensure that consumer credit reports contain only accurate, relevant, and recent information. For purposes of the FCRA, a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-consumercreditreport\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-78\" role=\"doc-glossref\">consumer credit report</span> is any communication of information by a consumer reporting agency that (1) bears on a consumer’s creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living and (2) is used or collected as a factor in establishing a consumer’s eligibility for insurance or credit. FCRA requirements govern the types of information that can be included in consumer credit reports as well as the permissible uses of such information.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-210\">The FCRA regulates <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-consumerreportingagencies\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-79\" role=\"doc-glossref\">consumer reporting agencies</span>, which<strong> </strong>are private businesses that assemble or evaluate information on consumers and furnish consumer credit reports to third parties in exchange for a fee. The FCRA also regulates the third parties, such as banks and insurance companies, that obtain the reports. Before obtaining such a report, a third party must disclose in writing to the consumer that it will obtain the report.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-211\">When a third party takes an adverse action based on information in a consumer credit report, the third party has certain duties to the consumer. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-adverseaction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-80\" role=\"doc-glossref\">adverse action</span>means (1) a denial or revocation of credit or insurance coverage, (2) a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement or insurance coverage, or (3) a refusal to grant credit or insurance in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. A third party that takes an adverse action based on a consumer credit report must: </p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-31\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-112\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-212\">Provide the consumer with information about the consumer reporting agency that provided the report.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-113\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-213\">Notify the consumer of her right to dispute with the reporting agency the accuracy or completeness of any information contained in the report.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-114\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-214\">Notify the consumer that she has the right to obtain a free copy of the credit report from the reporting agency.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-215\">For example, if an insurer obtains a credit report to underwrite an application for life insurance, the insurer must comply with the above FCRA requirements.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-72\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-11\">Unfair Trade Practices</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-216\">U.S. federal and state laws also regulate advertising and trade practices. The FTC Act prohibits false or deceptive advertising and unfair or deceptive acts or practices that affect commerce. In addition to investigating unfair or deceptive conduct, the FTC enforces various consumer protection statutes that prohibit specifically defined trade practices. Examples of such federal consumer protection laws are the FCRA (described above), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-217\">Most states have laws that place broad restrictions on deceptive or unfair trade practices. States also prohibit specific practices. For example, a business or its representatives cannot</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch3-ul-32\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-115\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-218\">Indicate that goods or services belong to another party</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-116\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-219\">Cause the likelihood of confusion as to the source, sponsorship, or certification of goods or services</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-117\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-220\">Represent that goods or services have characteristics, ingredients, uses, or qualities that they do not have</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch3-li-118\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch3-p-221\">Disparage the goods or services of another party by misrepresenting facts</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-222\">Usually, the state attorney general’s office is responsible for enforcing a state’s unfair trade practices laws. Authorities can obtain a cease-and-desist order to stop a business from engaging in deceptive trade practices. Also, consumers may file civil lawsuits against businesses that engage in deceptive practices, and plaintiffs may be awarded monetary damages. Furthermore, the states have specific regulations regarding how life insurers advertise and sell their products as well as how they pay claims. We explore these regulations and others, which are enforced by state insurance departments, later in the text.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

In the United States, federal, state, and local laws regulate many aspects of the employment relationship. Most such laws govern the employer-employee relationship only. Independent contractors generally are not covered by these laws. In this context, an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-employee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-81\" role=\"doc-glossref\">employee</span> is a person in the service of another, the employer, who has the power or right to control and direct how the employee performs the work. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-independentcontractor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-82\" role=\"doc-glossref\">independent contractor</span>is a person who contracts to do a specific task according to his own methods and who generally is not subject to the employer’s control except as to the end product or final result of the work. The main distinction between an employee and an independent contractor concerns the employer’s power or right to control how the work is performed. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-224\">Parties often characterize their relationship as either employer–employee or employer–independent contractor. Regardless of what the parties call themselves, whether a person is acting as an employee or an independent contractor is a question of fact. This distinction is important. If a relationship is deemed to be employer-employee, a number of employment laws would apply that may not apply to an employer–independent contractor relationship. Video 3.2 shows how U.S. courts decide whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video3-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-225\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-83\">Video 3.2</span> Employee or Independent Contractor?</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-73\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-74\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-226\">Employee or Independent Contractor?</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/3-2video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

Subject to limitations in some states, employees are considered to be <em>employees at will</em>, which means that either the employer or the employee can terminate employment at any time for any lawful reason. Although most employment relationships are at-will, the parties can change the nature of that employment relationship by entering into a contract. When the parties enter into a contract, the employer and employee must honor its terms. If they violate the contract terms, they are liable for breach of contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-228\">Unlike the at-will laws in the United States, the laws in many countries do not provide for an employment-at-will relationship. In these countries the laws are based on the idea that every employment relationship is a contractual relationship governed by the employment contract. Although, as a general rule, the parties are free to enter into any contract that they choose, laws in most countries provide some minimum statutory protections for employees. For example, statutes may prohibit a work week that exceeds 40 hours or may require at least two rest days per week. Generally, these protected areas cannot be limited by employment contracts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-229\">Like the laws in most other countries, U.S. federal and state laws impose standards on the employment relationship. Wage and hour standards and health and safety standards are common types of regulatory requirements around the world. As with other areas of the law, the specific standards vary by jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-230\">In the United States, the federal <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-fairlaborstandardsact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-90\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)</span> sets minimum requirements on the wages employers must pay workers. In addition to the FLSA, most states have minimum wage requirements. State and federal laws do not set limits on the number of hours that workers may be required to work each week. Typically, however, when employees work more than 40 hours in a week they must be paid at an overtime rate of at least 1½ times their normal hourly wage rate. Most employees covered by the FLSA are considered <em>nonexempt employees</em>. As such, they are entitled to overtime pay. <em>Exempt employees</em>, on the other hand, are not entitled to overtime pay. Generally, employees are classified as exempt or nonexempt based on how much they are paid, how they are paid, and the kind of work they do. For example, officers, managers, and certain credentialed professionals, such as attorneys, might be considered exempt employees, while all other employees would be nonexempt employees.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-86\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch3-h3-12\">Nondiscrimination Requirements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-231\">In the United States, a number of federal and state laws seek to ensure that employees are treated equally in the workplace. Employers must comply with all applicable state and federal employment laws. Employers may not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, age, gender, or disability in hiring, advancement, wages, and other terms and conditions of employment. Because group insurance and group retirement plans are considered terms and conditions of employment, these plans are subject to some employment laws. Figure 3.3 shows a few U.S. federal nondiscrimination laws.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1159px;\" id=\"figure3-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-232\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-91\">Figure 3.3</span> U.S. Federal Nondiscrimination Laws</p> <img alt=\"U.S. Federal Nondiscrimination Laws\" id=\"loma311-ch3-img-96\" src=\"../../imgs/3-3figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-87\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure3-3\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-92\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch3-div-88\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure3-3\" id=\"loma311-ch3-a-24\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 3-3 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-233\">The federal <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch3-gt-equalemploymentopportunitycommission\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch3-span-93\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</span> is the U.S. federal agency responsible for administering the federal antidiscrimination laws described in this section. In general, people who wish to file discrimination complaints in federal court must first file an administrative charge of discrimination with the EEOC. If the EEOC decides there is “reasonable cause” to believe discrimination has occurred, it tries to conciliate the charge by reaching a voluntary resolution between the parties to the complaint. If conciliation is not successful, the EEOC may file a lawsuit in federal court. The EEOC also may issue a right-to-sue-notice to the party who alleges the discrimination. A <em>right-to-sue-notice</em> allows the charging party to file an individual action in court without the EEOC’s involvement. Thus, before a person is permitted to file a civil lawsuit, he must pursue his claim with the EEOC.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch3-p-234\">Like the United States, most countries have enacted laws that prohibit certain types of employment discrimination. The protected classes of employees vary by country.

The fact that a contract is legally enforceable means that all of the parties have a legal duty to carry out the promises they made when they entered into the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-27\">In day-to-day life, people make many promises that we do not expect to be legally enforceable. If you promise your spouse that you’ll be home for dinner, your spouse might be disappointed if you are unable to come home in time. But neither of you likely expects your promise to have any legal consequences. Most jurisdictions around the world have developed a body of contract law to distinguish between casual promises and legally enforceable promises, as well as to define which remedies are available to enforce contracts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-28\">A life insurance policy requires the insurer to take certain actions and restricts the insurer from taking other certain actions. If the insurer breaches a contract by failing to carry out a promise it made when entering into the contract, the policyowner then has the right to seek a remedy from the courts for the breach. As an employee in the insurance industry, you may need to know about contract law to understand—and perhaps to explain to customers—how and when the law requires your company to act. This chapter describes some of the general rules of contract law in the United States and other common law jurisdictions around the world.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Case law includes general principles and rules that govern the formation and legal effect of contracts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-30\">Over time, legislatures have modified the common law principles by enacting statutes that apply to specific types of financial services contracts, such as insurance contracts. In Chapter 10, we describe how such statutes modify the general rules of contract law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-31\">In the United States, the state governments are responsible for enacting laws that govern most contracts. Thus, each state has created its own body of contract law that generally applies to contracts entered into within that state. The basic features of these state laws, however, are fairly uniform and are found in the laws of many other common law jurisdictions.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-9\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-1\">Conflict of Law Rules for Contracts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-32\">When the laws of more than one jurisdiction apply to a contract, conflict of law rules determine which jurisdiction’s laws take precedence. According to the general rules of contract law, the parties to a contract are allowed to mutually decide which jurisdiction’s laws will govern their contract. In a written contract, this right usually takes the form of a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-choiceoflawsprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">choice of laws provision</span>. A choice of laws provision usually specifies a jurisdiction with which at least one party has a connection. In individual life insurance, state law may specify that this jurisdiction is the state in which the policy is issued or delivered, which is generally the state of residence of the insured at the time of purchase. This jurisdiction is sometimes referred to as the <em>situs</em> of the contract. Courts typically apply the laws of the place designated by the parties and referred to in the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-33\">If the parties did not specify which jurisdiction’s laws are to govern their contract, the governing laws are determined depending on the parties’ location:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-32\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-34\"><em>All contracting parties are in the same jurisdiction</em>. The laws of that jurisdiction generally govern the contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-33\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-35\"><em>The contracting parties are in more than one jurisdiction</em>. The conflict of law rules adopted by the affected jurisdictions determine which jurisdiction’s laws govern the contract.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-36\">Many U.S. states and other common law jurisdictions follow the traditional common law rule, which states that a contract is governed by the law of the place where the contract was created. Typically, the contract is created in the place where the last act to create the contract was completed. In the United States, the last acts necessary to complete the formation of a life insurance contract are (1) payment of the initial premium and (2) delivery of the policy to the policyowner. Thus, a life insurance contract typically is considered created in the state in which the policy is delivered or the initial premium is paid, whichever occurs later. Generally, the law that governs a life insurance contract when it is issued continues to govern for the life of the contract.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-10\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-37\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-11\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-38\">Emily Fanene, who resides in State A, entered into a life insurance contract with Deervale Life Insurance, which is located in State B.

For example, we can classify a life insurance contract as an <em>informal, unilateral, aleatory contract of adhesion</em>. In this section, we identify just a few of the many types of contracts recognized by the common law.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-20\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-2\">Formal and Informal Contracts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-49\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-formalcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-14\" role=\"doc-glossref\">formal contract</span> is a contract that is enforceable because the parties met certain formalities concerning the form of the agreement. Historically, the common law required that all contracts be formal written documents that included a seal, which is a particular mark that attests to the execution of the document. Today, only a few types of contracts require these formalities. Many jurisdictions, for example, require contracts for the sale of real property to be formal contracts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-50\">Today most contracts, including life insurance contracts, are informal contracts. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-informalcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-15\" role=\"doc-glossref\">informal contract</span> is a contract that is enforceable because the parties met requirements concerning the substance of the agreement rather than requirements concerning the form of the agreement. With certain exceptions, an informal contract may be either oral or written. Informal contracts expressed in writing do not need a seal to be enforceable. Today, many written informal contracts are electronic in nature, such as a software application’s terms of use agreement. Even without a seal or a physical copy, by expressing an agreement in writing, the parties provide evidence of the specific terms of the contract. Figure 4.1 illustrates the features of formal and informal contracts.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:607px;\" id=\"figure4-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-51\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-16\">Figure 4.1</span> Features of Formal and Informal Contracts</p> <img alt=\"Features of Formal and Informal Contracts\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-36\" src=\"../../imgs/4-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-21\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure4-1\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-17\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-22\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure4-1\" id=\"loma311-ch4-a-15\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 4-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-23\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-3\">Bilateral and Unilateral Contracts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-52\">Contracts may be either bilateral or unilateral. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-bilateralcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">bilateral contract</span> is a contract under which both parties make legally enforceable promises. For example, contracts for the sale of goods generally are bilateral contracts, because both parties to the contract make an enforceable promise when they enter into the agreement. The purchasing party promises to pay the agreed-upon price, and the selling party agrees to provide the purchaser with specified goods at the agreed-upon price.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-53\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-unilateralcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">unilateral contract</span> is a contract under which only one of the contracting parties makes a legally enforceable promise. A life insurance policy is an example of a unilateral contract. The insurer that issues the policy promises to provide insurance coverage in return for the payment of a stated premium. As long as premiums are paid, the insurer is legally bound by its contractual promises. On the other hand, the purchaser of the policy does not promise to pay the premiums and cannot be compelled by law to pay the premiums. Instead, the policyholder has the right to stop paying premiums and to cancel the policy at any time.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-24\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-4\">Commutative and Aleatory Contracts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-54\">We also classify contracts as either commutative or aleatory. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-commutativecontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-20\" role=\"doc-glossref\">commutative contract</span> is an agreement under which the parties specify in advance the values that they will exchange, and the parties generally exchange items or services that they think are of relatively equal value. For example, contracts often involve the provision of specific services in exchange for a stated monetary amount of comparable value.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-55\">An annuity contract is an example of a commutative contract. The owner of an annuity contract pays a premium or premiums to the insurance company that issued the annuity. In exchange, the insurer agrees to make specified payments to a designated person. The amount paid for an annuity has a direct relationship to the amount that the insurer agrees to pay out under the annuity. In the context of the annuity contract, these amounts are relatively equal.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-25\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-56\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-26\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-57\">Elisabetta Martino bought an annuity contract from Menhir Life Insurance. The total amount of annuity benefit payments that Menhir will make is based on several factors, including the length of time over which Menhir will hold and invest the funds, and the length of time over which Menhir will make benefit payments. Ms. Martino’s premiums are therefore set at a relatively equal value to the payments and services Menhir will provide.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-58\">In an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-aleatorycontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">aleatory contract</span>, one party provides something of value to another party in exchange for a conditional promise. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-conditionalpromise\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-22\" role=\"doc-glossref\">conditional promise</span> is a promise to perform a stated act <em>if</em> a specified, uncertain event occurs. If that event occurs—usually an event that cannot be controlled by either party, such as natural disaster or death—the promise must be performed. Another feature of an aleatory contract is that if the specified event occurs, then one party may receive something of greater value than what the party gave in exchange for the conditional promise. The term “aleatory,” coming from the Latin noun <em>alea</em> describing a dice game dependent on uncertain odds, indicates the element of chance in the agreement.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-59\">A life insurance policy is an aleatory contract because the insurer’s promise to pay the policy proceeds is a conditional promise. This promise is contingent on an uncertain event, which is the death of the insured person while the policy is in force. In addition, the insurer and the policyowner agree to pay specified amounts, which are not required to be equal. If the policy terminates before the insured’s death, the insurer is no longer bound by the conditional promise to pay the policy proceeds, even if a number of premiums have been paid. Conversely, the insured may die soon after the policy is issued. In this situation, the death benefit payable may be a much larger amount than the total premiums paid.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-27\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-60\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-28\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-61\">Xavier Douglas bought a $150,000 insurance policy on his life. After paying $1,200 in premiums, Mr. Douglas decided he no longer needed the insurance and terminated the policy. The insurer received $1,200 in premiums and was not obligated to pay any policy benefits.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-62\">Yasmin Khan also bought a $150,000 insurance policy on her life from the same insurer. Ms. Khan died after paying $1,200 in premiums, and the insurer paid the $150,000 death benefit to her beneficiary.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-29\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-5\">Bargaining Contracts and Contracts of Adhesion</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-63\">We may further classify contracts as either bargaining contracts or contracts of adhesion. Most contracts are <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-bargainingcontracts\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-23\" role=\"doc-glossref\">bargaining contracts</span>, which are contracts created when both parties, as equals, set the terms and conditions of the contracts. In other words, both parties have equal bargaining power.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-64\">By contrast, some contracts are <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-contractsofadhesion\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-24\" role=\"doc-glossref\">contracts of adhesion</span>, which are contracts that one party prepares and that the other party must accept or reject as a whole, without any bargaining between the parties as to the terms of the contract. In contracts of adhesion, one party holds greater bargaining power than the other party does, because the first party is in a position to specify the terms of the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-65\">Individual life insurance policies and annuities are contracts of adhesion, because the applicant for such a contract generally must accept or reject the contract as the insurance company has written it. Conversely, many group life insurance and annuity contracts, especially for large groups, are bargaining contracts because both parties negotiate the terms of the contract.</p> <div

Such principles determine whether a given contract is legally enforceable and who has the right to enforce the contract. In describing the legal status of a contract, we often use the terms <em>valid</em>, <em>void</em>, and <em>voidable</em>.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-34\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-79\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-validcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-35\" role=\"doc-glossref\">valid contract</span> is a contract that is enforceable by law.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-35\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-80\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-voidcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-36\" role=\"doc-glossref\">void contract</span> is an agreement that was never enforceable by law. The term <em>void contract</em> is actually a contradiction in terms because it implies that a contract of some kind exists. Even when two parties form an agreement, if the agreement is not legally enforceable, then legally the parties did not create a contract. An agreement to carry out an illegal action is an example of a void contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-36\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-81\">At times, one of the parties to an otherwise enforceable contract has grounds to reject, or <em>avoid</em> the contract. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-voidablecontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">voidable contract</span> is one in which a party has the right to avoid her obligations under the contract without incurring legal liability.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-82\">What specific factors can make a contract void or voidable? Each jurisdiction sets specific requirements that the contracting parties must meet to create a valid contract. According to the common law rules in most of the United States, the formation of a valid informal contract involves four general requirements:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-37\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-83\">The parties to the contract must mutually assent (agree) to the terms of the contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-38\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-84\">The parties must exchange legally adequate consideration.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-39\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-85\">The parties must have contractual capacity.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-40\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-86\">The contract must be for a lawful purpose.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-87\">If any one of these requirements is not present, then one or all of the parties to the contract may have legal grounds to assert that the contract is not enforceable by law. Here we examine each of these requirements in detail.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-46\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-6\">Mutual Assent</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-88\">The requirement of mutual assent is sometimes described as a requirement that the parties reach a “meeting of the minds” concerning the terms of their agreement. In order to mutually assent to a contract, all of the parties must intend to be bound by the contract’s terms. In order to prove an intention to be bound, each party must make some outward expression of that intent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-89\">Whether a party intended to be bound by the terms of a contract is a question of fact. Because outside parties cannot determine a party’s subjective intent, the U.S. courts apply the reasonable person standard to determine whether the parties mutually assented to the terms of a contract.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-47\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-90\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-48\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-91\">Justin Yuen alleges that Maria Cruz breached their contract. Ms. Cruz maintains that she did not intend to be bound to a contract, and that she was joking when she agreed to the contract’s terms. Thus, she maintains that no contract was created. In the civil trial, the trier of fact must look at Ms. Cruz’s actions and decide whether a reasonable person in Mr. Yuen’s position would have understood that Ms. Cruz assented and intended to be bound to a contract with Mr. Yuen. If the trier of fact determines that Mr. Yuen had no reason to believe that Ms. Cruz was joking when she agreed to the contract’s terms, then the court is likely to find that the parties created a valid contract.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-92\">The typical form of demonstrating mutual assent is for one party to make an offer, which the other party accepts. Thus, the required elements of mutual assent are an <em>offer</em> and an <em>acceptance</em>.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-49\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch4-h4-1\">Offer</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-93\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-offer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-38\" role=\"doc-glossref\">offer</span> is a proposal that, if accepted by another according to its terms, constitutes a binding contract. The party who makes an offer is the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-offeror\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-39\" role=\"doc-glossref\">offeror</span>. The party to whom the offer is made is the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-offeree\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-40\" role=\"doc-glossref\">offeree</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-94\">An offer to contract must be definite. An offer is definite when it indicates that the offeror intends to be legally bound if the offeree accepts the offer. The offered terms must be definite enough that any resulting contract can be enforced. Because parties often negotiate before entering into a binding contract, it is critical to distinguish between negotiating and making a definite offer.

Courts in common law jurisdictions generally apply the reasonable person standard to the facts of a given situation to determine whether one party made an offer to contract. The trier of fact must decide whether a reasonable person in the offeree’s position would have understood that the other party made a definite offer to contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-98\">An offer must be definite, but an offer also is effective only if it is communicated to the offeree. An offer may be communicated</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-99\">Orally or in writing</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-100\">To one person, to multiple people, or even to the general public</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-101\">In order to accept an offer, the offeree must know of the offer. Thus, the offeree must actually receive the offer. For example, if a person mails an offer to a second person, the offer is not considered to have been made until the second person actually receives the offer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-102\">Offers do not remain valid indefinitely. When an offer terminates, the offeree loses the ability to accept the offer. An offer can terminate in several ways.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-103\">First, an offer can lapse. The offeror controls the offer and has the right to specify the length of time during which the offer will remain open. If the offeree does not accept the offer within the specified time, the offer terminates—or <em>lapses</em>—at the end of the specified time. If the offeror does not specify a time limit, an offer is considered to remain open for a reasonable length of time. What constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the particular situation. The subject matter of the transaction, the manner in which an offer was communicated, and customs and trade practices may be relevant to determining what a reasonable time may be. For example, an offer to buy perishable goods, communicated by telephone, probably implies that an immediate reply is requested. Conversely, an offer to buy imperishable goods, communicated by physical mail, does not imply that an immediate reply is expected.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-104\">Most offers are <em>revocable</em>, meaning the offeror can withdraw or revoke an offer at any time before it has been accepted. When the offeror revokes an offer, the offer terminates and the offeree can no longer accept the offer. An offer generally is revocable unless the offeror made a legally enforceable promise to keep the offer open for a specified time.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-105\">An offer also terminates if the offeree rejects the offer in whole or in part. Once an offeree has rejected an offer, the offeree cannot later accept that offer unless the offeror agrees to reopen the offer. This rule is necessary to protect the offeror, whose circumstances may have changed by the time the offeree attempts to accept an offer that has already terminated.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-63\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-106\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-64\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-107\">Ramil Tan offered to buy 100 shares of stock from Caitlyn Cork at its market value of $50 a share, and Ms. Cork rejected the offer. Ms. Cork cannot later accept the offer unless Mr. Tan agrees to reopen that offer. After Ms. Cork rejected the offer, Mr. Tan may have made another investment or the market value of Ms. Cork’s stock may have changed. It would be unfair to allow Ms. Cork to accept the offer after she had rejected it.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-108\">To accept an offer, an offeree must agree to the terms without qualification.

In such cases, the parties are unable to come to a meeting of the minds, and they cannot enter into an enforceable contract. We discuss the requirement of contractual capacity later in this chapter.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-78\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch4-h4-2\">Acceptance</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-112\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-acceptance\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-56\" role=\"doc-glossref\">acceptance</span> of an offer is the offeree’s unqualified agreement to be bound to the terms of the offer. Whether an offer was accepted is a question of fact that is evaluated by the objective test described earlier—that is, would a reasonable person in the offeror’s position believe that the offeree accepted the offer? As long as all other requirements for a contract are met, a contract is created when an offeree unconditionally accepts an offer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-113\">A general principle of contract law in the United States and many other jurisdictions is the principle of freedom of contract. According to the principle of <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-freedomofcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-57\" role=\"doc-glossref\">freedom of contract</span>, parties have the right to contract with whomever they choose and on whatever lawful terms they choose. The offeror controls the offer and has the right to decide with whom he will contract. In any given situation, therefore, the terms of the offer determine the identity of the offeree. The offeree is that person or persons to whom the offeror intended to make an offer. Generally, only the offeree can accept an offer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-114\">The offeree can accept an offer in a variety of ways, depending on the circumstances of the situation. Typically, the nature of the offer controls how the offeree must accept in order to create a contract. When an offeror makes an offer to enter into a bilateral contract, the offeror makes a promise and in exchange seeks a promise from the offeree. To create a contract, the offeree’s acceptance must be in the form of a written or oral promise indicating that the offeree intends to be bound. Figure 4.2 illustrates a bilateral contract.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:955px;\" id=\"figure4-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-115\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-58\">Figure 4.2</span> Bilateral Contract</p> <img alt=\"Bilateral Contract\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-97\" src=\"../../imgs/4-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-79\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure4-2\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-59\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-80\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure4-2\" id=\"loma311-ch4-a-20\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 4-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-116\">When an offeror makes an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, the offeror makes a promise and in return seeks the performance of an act, such as the payment of money. The offeree can accept the offer and create a contract by performing the requested act. The acceptance of an offer to enter into a unilateral contract, therefore, typically consists of conduct rather than words. Figure 4.3 illustrates a unilateral contract.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:975px;\" id=\"figure4-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-117\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-60\">Figure 4.3</span> Unilateral Contract</p> <img alt=\"Unilateral Contract\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-98\" src=\"../../imgs/4-3figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-81\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure4-3\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-61\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-82\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure4-3\" id=\"loma311-ch4-a-21\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 4-3 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-118\">The offeree’s acceptance must comply with all of the terms of the offer.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-60\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-119\">If the terms of an offer require a specific manner of acceptance, the offeree must accept in the specified manner in order to create a contract. For example, if an offer requires acceptance in writing, the offeree must accept in writing.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-120\">If the offer requires the offeree to perform more than one act to accept the offer, the offeree must perform all of the acts. For example, if the offer requires the offeree to sign a contract and send payment of a specified amount, signing the contract alone does not constitute acceptance.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-62\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-121\">If the offeror does not specify a particular manner of acceptance, the offeree can accept the offer in any manner that is reasonable under the circumstances. In such cases, the manner of acceptance must clearly indicate that the offeree intends to accept the offer.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-122\">The offeree usually must manifest the intent to accept by making some outward expression of that intent. For example, when the parties put their agreement into writing, they generally all sign the document to show that they intend to be bound to the contract. As a general rule, the offeree’s silence—that is, failure to reject an offer—does not constitute an acceptance.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-83\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-123\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-84\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-124\">Rufus Sharpe sent Dierdre Banks a letter offering to sell an automobile to her and ended the letter with the statement, “If I do not hear from you by Friday, I will know that you accept my offer.” In this case, if Ms. Banks does not respond, her silence would not constitute acceptance of the offer. It is impossible to determine whether she intends to accept the offer or whether she even received the offer.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-125\">Requirements for a valid acceptance in civil law jurisdictions are quite similar to those in common law jurisdictions.

Instead, the courts generally leave it to the parties to make their own agreement on the terms they choose, even if the value of the consideration is minimal. In England, for example, some contracts require a “peppercorn” of consideration, which might be a very small sum of money. A few contracts even ask for a literal peppercorn as payment.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-142\">According to general contract law, consideration can consist of either a promise or an act. Mutual promises, such as those exchanged in a bilateral contract, generally are adequate consideration for each other. Similarly, the performance of an act in exchange for a promise is adequate consideration to support a valid unilateral contract. For example, the act requested in exchange for a promise often is the payment of a specified amount of money.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-143\">The insight below further discusses types of promises that do <em>not</em> qualify as adequate consideration.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-107\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Promises That Do Not Qualify as Adequate Consideration\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-131\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-144\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-108\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-145\">Promises That Do Not Qualify as Adequate Consideration</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-146\">Courts sometimes decide that certain types of promises do not amount to adequate or sufficient consideration.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-147\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-gratuitouspromise\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-76\" role=\"doc-glossref\">gratuitous promise</span> is a promise that is not supported by consideration.

This requirement ensures that contracting parties are mature enough and have the mental capacity to protect their own interests. Common law generally presumes that most people have contractual capacity. The primary groups who have limited contractual capacity are persons who are (1) under the age of majority or (2) mentally incapacitated. If such persons enter contracts, the contracts may not be valid and binding on all of the parties.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-113\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch4-h4-3\">Minors</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-160\">Traditional common law stated that the age of majority was 21. Anyone younger than 21 was a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-minor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-80\" role=\"doc-glossref\">minor</span> who did not have full contractual capacity. Most legislatures, however, have enacted laws that modify the traditional common law rules. Most states in the United States now have made 18 the age of majority. In those states, contracts entered into by 18-year-olds of sound mind are valid and binding on both parties. Figure 4.4 lists the age of majority in some other countries.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1275px;\" id=\"figure4-4\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-161\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-81\">Figure 4.4</span> Age of Majority in Selected Jurisdictions</p> <img alt=\"Age of Majority in Selected Jurisdictions\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-132\" src=\"../../imgs/4-4figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-114\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure4-4\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-82\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-115\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure4-4\" id=\"loma311-ch4-a-25\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 4-4 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-162\">According to the common law, contracts entered into by a minor usually are voidable by the minor. Thus, a minor can enforce a contract against the other party to the contract, but the other party cannot enforce the contract against the minor. This rule protects minors against those who would take advantage of a minor’s innocence or lack of experience.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-163\">Because minors generally can avoid liability for their contracts, competent parties often are hesitant to contract with minors. But it is sometimes in a minor’s best interest to contract with a competent party. Therefore, the common law provides some exceptions to the general rule that a minor’s contracts are voidable by the minor. One of the primary common law exceptions states that a contract for necessaries is not voidable by a minor. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-necessaries\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-83\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Necessaries</span>are goods and services that a minor or other incapacitated person actually requires to sustain her well-being. Whether specific goods and services are necessaries is a question of fact that must be answered on a case-by-case basis. For example, a court typically considers food, clothing, lodging, and medical attention to be necessaries, unless the minor does not actually need them. Thus, if a minor lives with his parents, and they provide him with food and clothing, a contract a minor enters into to purchase food or clothing probably is not a contract for necessaries. Although a minor may not avoid a contract for necessaries, the minor is required to pay only the reasonable value of such necessaries. Thus, if the contract price is greater than the reasonable value of the necessaries, the minor cannot be forced to pay the full contract price. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-164\">Legislatures have modified the common law rules to make some additional types of contracts valid and binding on minors. For example, many states have enacted laws that authorize minors of a stated age to enter into life and health insurance contracts if specific conditions are met.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-165\">Some countries such as the United States have enacted a legal mechanism known as <em>emancipation of minors</em> by which a minor may be freed from the control of his parents or guardians before the age of majority. In the United States, the means by which a minor might attain emancipation vary from state to state, but often include a petition to the courts in which the minor proves financial self-sufficiency. It is rare for a minor to achieve emancipation, but in certain states an emancipated minor does possess the contractual capacity of an adult. Some states give minors full contractual capacity, and others do not.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-166\">In most cases, though, contracts are voidable by a minor. A minor’s exercise of his right to avoid a contract is known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-disaffirmance\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-84\" role=\"doc-glossref\">disaffirmance</span>. A minor can disaffirm a contract at any time before reaching the age of majority and within a reasonable time after attaining the age of majority. If a minor disaffirms a contract, the minor generally must return whatever consideration he received for the contract. If the minor returns the consideration, the minor can recover whatever he gave to the other party as consideration. The parties will be restored as much as possible to the same positions they were in before entering the contract. For example, if an insurer were to enter into a life insurance contract with a minor and the minor then chose to disaffirm the contract, the insurer would return any premium payments that the minor had made.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-116\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch4-h4-4\">Mental Incapacity</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-167\">To enter into a valid contract, each party must have the mental capacity to clearly understand the nature of the agreement and the effect of entering into the agreement. A party’s mental incapacity is a question of fact that must be decided on a case-by-case basis. The effect of a party’s mental incapacity on the validity of a contract depends on whether a court has found the person to be incompetent and has appointed a guardian for the person.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-168\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-guardian\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-85\" role=\"doc-glossref\">guardian</span> is an individual or group of individuals who is authorized by a court to take care of a person, known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-ward\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-86\" role=\"doc-glossref\">ward</span>, and manage the ward’s property and affairs. Typical cases involve people who have a cognitive disability, mental illness, advanced age, or addiction. Court proceedings to appoint a guardian generally are initiated when a family member asks the court to protect the person. The potential ward may be in danger of squandering his property or at risk of being taken advantage of by another party because he is unable to understand how to protect himself and his property. In such a case, the person’s court-appointed guardian has the capacity to enter into contracts on the ward’s behalf. Any contract the ward enters into without the consent of the guardian is void. The result is the same regardless of whether the other contracting party knew about the guardian. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-169\">Sometimes a person’s mental competencies are impaired, but she has not been declared incompetent by a court. For example, a person can be mentally impaired as a result of being drunk, drugged, or mentally ill. The validity of a contract entered into by someone whose competence is impaired at the time of contracting depends on the person’s ability to understand the agreement. For example, a mentally challenged person may be able to understand some simple transactions and yet not understand the terms of more complicated agreements. Similarly, some mental disorders are stronger and more impairing than other disorders. For example, a person suffering from mild depression likely has the mental capacity to enter into an enforceable contract as long as the person understands the nature and consequences of an agreement, whereas a person suffering from severe dementia likely lacks that mental capacity.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-117\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch4-h4-5\">Contractual Capacity of Corporations</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-170\">As a general rule, a corporation is a legal person that has the necessary capacity to enter contracts. The specific limits placed on the contractual capacity of a corporation are spelled out in the corporation’s articles of incorporation, which generally describe the types of activities and the type of business in which the corporation will engage. Statutes in many jurisdictions also place limits on the contractual capacity of corporations. In each case, the capacity of a given corporation to enter into a specific type of contract is a question of fact that depends on the specific situation. The articles of incorporation or by-laws may also specify who may execute a contract on behalf of the corporation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-171\">As we discussed in the previous chapter, applicable laws generally require financial services companies to operate as corporations, and a life insurer’s articles of incorporation generally state that the corporations will engage in a life insurance business. To conduct a life insurance business in a given jurisdiction, that jurisdiction generally must license the insurer to conduct such a business. Thus, the insurer’s capacity to issue life insurance contracts within a given jurisdiction depends both on the insurer’s articles of incorporation and on whether the insurer has obtained a license to offer life insurance contracts in that jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-172\">According to laws in most jurisdictions, corporations also have certain implied powers to conduct their businesses. They generally have the power to enter into any kind of contract that would allow them to conduct normal operations. For example, corporations can contract for the office space, supplies, and services needed to operate their businesses.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-118\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-9\">Lawful Purpose</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-173\">When the purpose of an agreement is illegal, such as the performance of a criminal act, the agreement is illegal and void. The courts will not enforce such an agreement. All jurisdictions have enacted laws that make certain acts punishable as crimes. An agreement to commit a crime is unenforceable in the courts. Likewise, an agreement to commit a tort is unenforceable in the courts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-174\">An agreement also is illegal if it violates public policy or violates a principle of common law. Agreements that are contrary to public policy include agreements that unreasonably restrain a person’s right to marry and agreements that unreasonably restrain competition. Generally, an agreement not to compete with another party is void if the only purpose of the agreement is to restrain competition. However, some agreements may contain noncompetition clauses that are enforceable if they meet certain requirements:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-175\"><strong>The clause serves a legitimate business purpose.</strong> For example, consider a case involving the sale of a business that has developed valuable relationships with its existing customers. The buyer has a legitimate business purpose for wanting to include a noncompetition clause under which the seller agrees not to operate a competing business to which the buyer’s customers would defect.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-71\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-176\"><strong>The restriction is reasonable in terms of its time limits, its geographic limits, and its scope.</strong> For example, some employment contracts have noncompetition clauses that prohibit a former employee from competing with the employer in any activities for a specified time period after leaving employment. Restrictions for a period of one year are common and generally considered to be reasonable and enforceable. Restrictions for extended periods of time, such as 20 years, are considered to be unreasonable and unenforceable.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-72\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-177\"><strong>The restraint does not impose an undue hardship.</strong> For example, if a noncompetition clause would prevent a person from earning a living, the courts are unlikely to enforce the clause.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-178\">Some aleatory contracts are illegal. The primary example of an illegal contract is a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-wageringcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-87\" role=\"doc-glossref\">wagering contract</span> in which either party may gain or lose depending on the outcome of an uncertain event, such as a sporting event. Private wagering agreements are illegal and unenforceable. Recall that insurance contracts are aleatory contracts. State laws impose an insurable interest requirement to guard against insurance contracts being purchased as wagering contracts. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-insurableinterest\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-88\" role=\"doc-glossref\">insurable interest</span> exists when a person is likely to suffer a genuine loss or detriment should the event insured against occur. If the insurable interest requirement is met when a policy is purchased, the contract is not an illegal wagering agreement. We describe the insurable interest requirement further in Chapter 10.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-119\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch4-h3-10\">Contract Formation in Civil Law Jurisdictions</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-179\">In civil law jurisdictions, the basics of contract law typically are part of a jurisdiction’s <em>law of obligations</em>. Many obligations arise from applicable laws, such as obligations that arise when one’s negligence harms another. An obligation may also arise as the result of a contract. For example, a person who enters into a contract to hire another person becomes obligated to pay the agreed-upon wages in exchange for the other party’s performance of the work. Civil law jurisdictions often impose the following requirements for the formation of a valid contract:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-73\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-180\"><strong>The parties must consent by means of an offer and acceptance.</strong> Certain persons, such as minors and mentally incompetent people, cannot consent to a contract. Note that this requirement is similar to the common law requirements of mutual assent and contractual capacity.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-181\"><strong>The subject matter of the contract must be certain.</strong> Generally, anything that can be identified with certainty can be the subject of a contract. Services that are not illegal or against public policy also generally can be the subject of a contract. This requirement is similar to the common law requirement that contracts must be for a lawful purpose.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-182\"><strong>An obligation created by the contract must have a cause.</strong> In other words, a party who becomes obligated under a contract must have an adequate cause for entering into the obligation. Generally, a party who becomes obligated receives something in exchange, such as the other party’s promise or performance of an act. This requirement is similar to the common law requirement that the parties to a contract must exchange legally adequate consideration.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"question-wrapper\"

But when a dispute arises, the parties may resort to the courts. A breach of contract that results in damage to the innocent party gives the innocent party a cause of action against the breaching party. When a lawsuit is filed concerning a contract breach, the defendant may have any number of legal defenses to the lawsuit. For example, if any requirement for the formation of a contract was not met, the defendant has a legal defense to the lawsuit. In cases where the defendant lacked the necessary legal capacity to enter into a contract, the contract is void or voidable by the defendant and the plaintiff’s action for breach of contract will fail. Other defenses to the formation of a contract include duress, undue influence, misrepresentation, and fraud.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-202\">For a contract to be valid, all parties must freely enter into the contract. Therefore, if one party enters a contract under duress, the contract generally is voidable by that party. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-duress\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-98\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Duress</span> exists when a person acts wrongfully or threateningly to overpower the will of another so as to force that person to enter into a contract against her own free will. Duress can take a number of forms, such as threats or physical or mental coercion. When a person enters into a contract under duress such that a reasonable person would have been compelled to enter into the contract against her will, then the contract generally is voidable by that person.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-203\">Similarly, a contract created by the use of undue influence is voidable by the party who was the subject of the undue influence. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-undueinfluence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-99\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Undue influence</span> is the misuse of a position of power or trust to overcome the free will of another person. For example, a party may—because of weakness, trust, or dependence—unreasonably rely on the advice of another. The potential for undue influence exists in relationships between lawyer and client, doctor and patient, guardian and ward, and parent and child. The stronger party exerts undue influence by using his position to persuade the weaker party to act for the benefit of the stronger party rather than the weaker party.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-204\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-misrepresentation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-100\" role=\"doc-glossref\">misrepresentation</span> is an untrue statement of fact. As a general rule, when one party makes a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-materialmisrepresentation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-101\" role=\"doc-glossref\">material misrepresentation</span>—that is, a misrepresentation that induces the other party to enter into a contract that it would not have entered had it known the truth—the contract is voidable by the innocent party. Such a contract is voidable whether the person making the misrepresentation did so knowingly or in the belief that their untrue statement of fact was true. Material misrepresentation is an important defense for insurers because they must be able to rely on representations of fact provided by applicants for insurance. This reliance on accurate representations of fact has given rise to the concept of utmost good faith, as described in the insight below. We discuss material misrepresentation in more detail in Chapter 13. </p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-132\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Utmost Good Faith vs. Caveat Emptor\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-163\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-205\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-133\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-206\">Utmost Good Faith vs. Caveat Emptor</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-207\">From the insurer’s perspective, the need to receive accurate and truthful information from a proposed insured is very important. The concept of <em>utmost good faith</em> (or <em>uberrima fides</em>) means that all parties entering into an insurance contract must deal in good faith, meaning in an open and fair manner. For example, a person applying for life insurance must disclose all relevant information concerning his health, activities, and other risk factors.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-208\">By contrast, some other types of contract are governed by the principle of <em>caveat emptor</em>, or “let the buyer beware.” This principle historically governed many contracts for the sale of real property. In effect, caveat emptor states that the buyer assumes the risk that a purchase may not meet the buyer’s expectations. The buyer has the responsibility of reasonably examining the item to be purchased before the purchase is completed. In recent years, consumer protection laws have reduced the number of contracts governed by the caveat emptor principle. Today, caveat emptor applies largely to goods and property that are sold “as is,” or that otherwise come with no guarantee or warranty.</p> </div> </div> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

For example, a contract for the sale of goods is performed when the goods have been delivered to the buyer, who pays for the goods in full. When a party carries out her obligations, she is discharged and has no further obligations under the contract. Contracting parties can also be discharged in the following situations:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-210\">The parties can discharge a contract by mutual agreement.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-211\">The parties can discharge a contract by entering into an agreement known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-accordandsatisfaction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-102\" role=\"doc-glossref\">accord and satisfaction</span>, in which one party agrees to accept something other than what he was entitled to receive under the original contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-212\">A party can waive his right to require another party’s performance of a contract. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-waiver\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-103\" role=\"doc-glossref\">waiver</span> is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right. Such a waiver discharges the other party’s obligation to perform the contract.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-213\">As a general rule, a breach of contract may be a <em>minor breach</em> or a <em>substantial breach</em>. After a minor breach, the contract typically remains valid and enforceable. Parties continue to have a duty to perform their remaining contractual obligations. The innocent party, however, may have the right to have the breach remedied.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-134\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-214\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-135\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-215\">Charles Nash entered into a contract with the TUV Construction Company. TUV agreed to build a house for Mr. Nash, for which he agreed to pay a specified amount. TUV completed the house but failed to install a kitchen oven in accordance with the terms of the contract. TUV substantially performed its part of the contract by building the house, so Mr. Nash is required to pay TUV the purchase price. However, Mr. Nash also has the right to have the breach remedied. TUV must either install the oven or be liable for the damages that result from its failure to install the oven. The amount of these damages would include, for example, the cost of having someone else install the oven.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-216\">By contrast, when one party substantially breaches a contract, the innocent party has two possible courses of action. She can affirm the contract and treat it as if it were valid and binding. Alternatively, the innocent party can treat the contract as if it were terminated. This option excuses her from performing any remaining contractual obligations. In addition, the innocent party has a right to a remedy for the damages that resulted from the breach.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-217\">Whether a contract has been performed and whether a party has breached a contract are questions of fact. In deciding such questions of fact, the courts are likely to consider all of the circumstances surrounding the transaction.

Unless a statute requires an informal contract to be in writing, an oral informal contract is valid. However, contracting parties often seek to protect their interests by putting their agreements in writing. A written agreement provides evidence that the contract exists and evidence as to the terms of the contract. If a lawsuit concerns an oral contract, the parties have the often difficult task of proving that a contract was formed and proving the terms of the contract. If there is no written evidence of the contract, the court must base its decision solely on the conflicting testimony of the parties to the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-225\">A number of statutes require certain kinds of contracts to be in writing, such as insurance contracts. Most U.S. states and other common law jurisdictions have enacted some form of the common law Statute of Frauds. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-statuteoffrauds\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-107\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Statute of Frauds</span> is a law that declares certain types of contracts to be unenforceable unless they are evidenced by a written document signed by the party to be charged with performing the contract.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-140\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-226\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-141\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-227\">Terrence Hugo filed a lawsuit in which he alleges that Camille Lexington breached their contract. The contract is governed by the Statute of Frauds. Mr. Hugo must provide evidence in the form of a written document that contains the contract’s terms and that is signed by Ms. Lexington. If Mr. Hugo cannot produce such evidence, then the Statute of Frauds provides Ms. Lexington with a legal defense to the lawsuit, and the contract will be unenforceable.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-228\">The Statute of Frauds typically governs the following types of contracts, which must be in writing to be enforceable:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-229\">A promise by the executor or administrator of a deceased person’s estate to answer for a debt of the deceased out of the executor’s or administrator’s own funds.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-80\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-230\">A promise to be responsible for the debt or default of another.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-81\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-231\">An agreement made in consideration of marriage.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-82\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-232\">A contract concerning an interest in land.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-83\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-233\">An agreement that cannot be performed according to its terms within one year after the contract is completed. If it is at all possible for the parties to perform a contract within one year, then the contract is not subject to the Statute of Frauds and need not be in writing to be enforceable. Insurance contracts generally can be performed within one year, and therefore the Statute of Frauds does not require them to be in writing. By contrast, an agreement to enter into a partnership to last for 10 years cannot be performed according to its terms within one year and must be in writing in order to be enforceable.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-234\">The statute’s requirement of a written document usually is met if the plaintiff in a lawsuit produces a writing that contains the essential terms of the agreement. This writing must be signed by the party to be charged with performing the contract—that is, the defendant. The other party need not have signed the document. In addition, the writing may consist of more than one document as long as the documents refer to each other and are clearly connected with one transaction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-235\">Keep in mind that the Statute of Frauds is only one law that may require a specific type of contract to be in writing. Many states or other common law jurisdictions require certain types of contracts, such as insurance policies, to be in writing even though the Statute of Frauds does not require the same. Figure 4.5 lists several types of agreements for which states and other common law jurisdictions have imposed a writing requirement.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:891px;\" id=\"figure4-5\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-236\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-108\">Figure 4.5</span> Additional Writing Requirements</p> <img alt=\"Additional Writing Requirements\" class=\"usesFloatingControlbar\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-174\" src=\"../../imgs/4-5figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-142\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure4-5\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-109\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch4-div-143\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure4-5\" id=\"loma311-ch4-a-30\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 4-5 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Thus, parties in dispute often call on courts to interpret the meaning of those terms. When the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, no interpretation is needed. The terms of the contract take effect in accordance with their clear meaning. A court cannot rewrite a contract for the parties. The court must enforce the contract as the parties wrote it.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-238\">If the terms of a contract are not clear, however, the court must follow established rules of contract construction to interpret the meaning of the contract. In common law jurisdictions, these rules of contract construction typically are found in the jurisdiction’s case law. In civil law jurisdictions, rules of contract construction typically are found in the jurisdiction’s statutory law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-239\">A court’s primary goal in interpreting a contract is to determine what the parties intended when they entered into the contract. The court must analyze the words that the parties used in the contract to determine the parties’ intent. Generally, courts try to determine the most reasonable meaning of the contract given the circumstances of the situation. The question the courts try to answer is, “What would a reasonable person in the position of the parties have understood the contract to mean?”</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-240\">In interpreting the meaning of a contract, a court must consider the entire contract. It must consider all of the words included in the contract and analyze all of the contract’s provisions together to determine the purpose and intent of the contract. The court must construe the contract so that all of its provisions are given effect in a consistent and reasonable manner.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-241\">Courts generally give words their plain, ordinary meaning. Nevertheless, the intent of the parties controls the meaning of words used in a contract. If the parties seem to have intended a word to have a technical meaning as opposed to the word’s most common meaning, the court will construe the contract by giving the word its technical meaning.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-242\">Occasionally, a contract consists of a preprinted form on which the parties have handwritten or typed additions or changes to the form. In interpreting such a contract, the courts generally place more importance on the handwritten or typed portions of the contract. Because handwritten or typed portions are amendments, they are more likely to represent the parties’ intent than are the preprinted portions. Thus, if a preprinted portion conflicts with a handwritten or typed portion, the handwritten or typed portion generally is given effect; and if a typed portion conflicts with a handwritten portion, the handwritten portion generally is given effect.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-243\">Courts typically interpret unclear or ambiguous language against the party who drafted or prepared the written contract, unless the use of the unclear language was required by law. This rule, known as the <em>principle of against the offeror</em> (or the <em>rule of contra proferentem</em>), is applied most often to contracts of adhesion such as insurance policies. If an insurance policy contains ambiguous terms, the courts will construe the contract against the insurer and in favor of the policyowner or beneficiary.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch4-question-11-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"ms\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch4-question-11\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-244\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-175\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch4-question-11-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-245\">According to the Statute of Frauds, which of the following types of contracts must be in writing to be enforceable?

The courts have developed procedural rules that govern the evidence that may be produced at trial. One such procedural rule, known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-parolevidencerule\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-111\" role=\"doc-glossref\">parol evidence rule</span>, states that parol evidence is <em>not</em> admissible to add to, vary, or contradict the terms of a written contract. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch4-gt-parolevidence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch4-span-112\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Parol evidence</span> is evidence that is extrinsic to—that is, outside of—an unambiguous written agreement. Parol evidence may be oral evidence, such as the testimony of witnesses concerning the negotiations leading up to the contract, or it may be written evidence, such as letters or memoranda.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-252\">The common law courts developed the parol evidence rule to allow contracting parties to rely on the certainty of a written contract. With this rule in force, one party cannot subsequently try to change the terms of the agreement to her advantage. The rule applies only when the parties entered into a valid written contract and intended the writing to contain their entire agreement. In other words, if the writing is clear, definite, and complete, the law presumes that the parties reduced their entire agreement to that writing. Thus, parol evidence is not admissible to add to, vary, or contradict the writing. The rule, however, does not prevent the introduction of evidence that is intended to prove that no contract was formed. For example, the defendant has the right to introduce evidence that the contract was illegal and void or was entered into under duress.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-253\">The parol evidence rule also applies only when the written contract is clear and unambiguous. In such cases, the court will enforce the contract as written and will exclude parol evidence that contradicts the written contract. Parol evidence, however, is admissible to aid a court in interpreting a written contract that is unclear. For example, the parties are allowed to introduce evidence to explain the meaning of technical terms and terms that have a special trade meaning or a special meaning in the locality where the contract was completed.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-254\">As with most procedural rules, the parol evidence rule has a number of exceptions. The following are some specific situations in which courts permit the use of parol evidence:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch4-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-84\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-255\">When it is reasonably certain that the written contract does not contain all of the terms that the parties intended to include in their agreement, the courts permit parol evidence to prove the omitted terms.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-85\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-256\">When the parties made an oral agreement after they reduced their original agreement to writing, the courts permit parol evidence concerning the subsequent oral agreement.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch4-li-86\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch4-p-257\">When the written contract does not express the true intent of the parties, the courts permit parol evidence concerning the actual intent of the parties. For example, assume that the parties agreed on a contract price of $10,000 but mistakenly drafted the written contract to state a price of $100,000. The parties are permitted to introduce parol evidence concerning the contract price.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-258\">To avoid ambiguity regarding the admissibility of parol evidence, contracts will often include an <em>entire contract provision</em>, which states that the entirety of the agreement between the parties is contained in the contract. We discuss the entire contract provision in more detail in Chapter 10.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch4-question-12-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch4-question-12\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-259\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch4-img-193\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch4-question-12-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch4-p-260\">Mr. Xavier and Ms. Yelenovich entered into a written contract with each other, and subsequently entered into a dispute over the contract’s terms.

Also, many of an insurer’s employees act as agents for the company. For example, information provided by service representatives, even in an email or a phone call, can create legally binding obligations on their company.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-44\">This chapter describes some of the basic rules of agency law in the United States.

Here are a few examples of some familiar transactions that may involve agency relationship:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-39\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-46\"><em>Real estate transactions</em>. A person selects a real estate agent to represent him in the sale or purchase of a home.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-40\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-47\"><em>Financial services transactions</em>. An investor selects a stockbroker to purchase stock on her behalf.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-41\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-48\"><em>Contract negotiations</em>. An athlete chooses an agent to represent him in contract negotiations.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-49\">An agent may hold broad authority to act on behalf of the principal. Conversely, an agency relationship may be created for a limited purpose or for one specified transaction. Agency relationships also can vary in duration. An agency relationship may be ongoing, or it may be created for a stated period of time. The scope of an agent’s authority and the duration of the agency relationship often depend on the type of transactions involved. For example, the agency relationship for the real estate transaction described above would likely be for one specified transaction and would end after a specified period of time. Conversely, in the agency relationship for the financial services transactions described above, the stockbroker might hold broad authority to purchase stock on the investor’s behalf on an ongoing basis.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-9\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-1\">Agency Agreement</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-50\">Typically, an agency relationship is created by an agreement between the principal and agent. As part of an agency agreement, the principal confers actual authority on the agent. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-actualauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-13\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Actual authority</span> is the authority to act on behalf of the principal that the principal intentionally confers on the agent and that the agent reasonably believes is conferred. Actual authority can be either express or implied.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-42\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-51\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-expressauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-14\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Express authority</span> is the authority that a principal explicitly confers on an agent.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-43\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-52\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-impliedauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-15\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Implied authority</span>, or <em>incidental authority</em>, is the authority that a principal intends an agent to have and that arises incidentally from an express grant of authority. Implied authority is included with express authority. It gives an agent the authority to do all the other acts that are reasonably necessary to carry out her express duties.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-10\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-53\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-11\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-54\">A real estate agent (the agent) representing a home seller (the principal) has <em>express authority</em> per a sales agreement to sell the person’s home. The real estate agent has <em>implied authority</em> to speak to interested parties on behalf of the seller.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-55\">An insurance agent (the agent) has <em>express authority</em> per an agency agreement with an insurer (the principal) to solicit life insurance applications. The agent has <em>implied authority</em> to telephone potential applicants on behalf of the insurer to arrange sales appointments.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-56\">As a general rule, a principal may do anything through an agent that the principal can legally do for himself. Some acts, however, are of such a personal nature that they cannot be delegated to an agent. For example, an individual cannot make a statement under oath through an agent. The law requires individuals to perform such an act themselves.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-57\">The scope of an agent’s actual authority is a question of fact. The courts typically use an objective test to determine the scope of that authority. In applying this objective test, the trier of fact must determine what authority a reasonable person in the position of the agent would understand the principal to have conferred on the agent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-58\">No formalities are required to create an agency relationship. The parties generally may consent either orally or in writing. Some agency agreements, however, must be in writing to be enforceable. For example, the Statute of Frauds requires an agency agreement that is to last for more than one year to be in writing in order to be enforceable by the courts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-59\">We discuss the agency agreement between insurers and insurance agents in Chapter 10.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-12\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-2\">Effect of Agency Relationship</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-60\">When an agent acts within the scope of her authority, the agent’s acts typically are considered to be the acts of the principal. Likewise, when an agent, acting within the scope of her authority, enters into a contract, the contract is binding on the principal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-61\">Another basic rule of agency law is that knowledge of the agent is knowledge of the principal. In other words, while the agent is carrying out the principal’s business, any knowledge the agent gains typically is considered knowledge the principal has gained as well. The principal is deemed to have this information regardless of whether the agent actually communicates it to the principal.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-13\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-62\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-14\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-63\">A policyowner calls an insurer’s customer service number shown on her policy. The policyowner may rely on the information provided by the customer service representative who, for this purpose, is acting in the capacity of an agent for the insurer. If the policyowner discloses information relevant to the policy, this information is considered to be knowledge that the insurer has gained even if the customer service representative did not document the information.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-15\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-3\">Capacity of the Parties</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-64\">The legal effect of a contract entered into by an agent on behalf of the principal may vary based on the contractual capacity of the parties.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-16\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch5-h4-1\">Contractual Capacity of the Principal</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-65\">As noted above, when an agent enters into a contract, the contract generally is binding on the principal. However, the legal effect of a contract entered into by an agent on behalf of the principal depends in part on the contractual capacity of the principal. For a contract entered into by an agent to be valid and binding on the principal, the principal must have contractual capacity. For example, if a minor appoints an agent who enters into a contract for non-necessaries on the minor’s behalf, the contract is voidable by the minor. Likewise, a principal who has been judicially declared insane lacks contractual capacity. Any contracts that an agent tries to create on behalf of such a principal generally are void.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-17\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch5-h4-2\">Contractual Capacity of the Agent</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-66\">An agent who enters into a contract on his principal’s behalf is not a party to that contract. Thus, the agent generally does not need to have contractual capacity to form a contract that binds the principal. In appointing an agent, however, the principal assumes the risks of being represented by the agent. For example, if a competent principal appoints a minor as her agent, any contract the minor enters into within the scope of his authority as an agent is binding on the principal. Because the agent is a minor, however, the agency agreement between the agent and principal is voidable by the minor.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch5-question-3-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch5-question-3\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-67\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch5-img-24\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch5-question-3-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-68\">(<strong>Apparent </strong>/ <strong>Actual</strong>) authority is the authority to act on behalf of the principal that the principal intentionally confers on the agent and that the agent reasonably believes is conferred.

In addition, the common law imposes a number of duties on agents. By authorizing an agent to act on her behalf, a principal places her trust in the agent. Thus, the agent is a fiduciary, who must meet her fiduciary duties. Figure 5.1 summarizes the agent’s duties to the principal.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:903px;\" id=\"figure5-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-74\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-21\">Figure 5.1</span> Agent’s Duties to the Principal</p> <img alt=\"Agent’s Duties to the Principal\" id=\"loma311-ch5-img-42\" src=\"../../imgs/5-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-26\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure5-1\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-22\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-27\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure5-1\" id=\"loma311-ch5-a-14\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 5-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-28\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-4\">Loyalty and Good Faith</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-75\">An agent who acts in a fiduciary capacity owes a duty of undivided loyalty and good faith to the principal. This duty requires an agent acting within the scope of his authority to act primarily for the principal’s benefit. The agent, therefore, must put the interests of the principal above all other interests, including the agent’s own interests.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-76\">An agent’s duty of loyalty and good faith requires the agent to provide the principal with all material information that relates to the principal’s business. In addition, an agent may not engage in any business that interferes with or competes with the principal’s business. In some circumstances, however, an agent may have a financial interest in a transaction that involves the principal. In such a case, the agent has a duty to fully disclose all material facts to the principal. The agent may deal on his own behalf in such a transaction only when the principal, with full knowledge of the material facts, consents to the transaction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-77\">The duty of loyalty and good faith prohibits an agent from making secret profits from the agency relationship. An agent also may not receive secret commissions or other undisclosed payments from third parties. An agent who receives undisclosed profits from the agency relationship must turn over those profits to the principal.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-29\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-5\">Obedience</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-78\">An agent has a duty to obey the principal’s instructions. Because an agent is acting for the principal, the agent must carry out her duties according to the principal’s wishes. An agent, however, has no duty to obey instructions that are unlawful or unreasonable. For example, if an agent would be physically endangered by following the principal’s instructions, the agent has no duty to follow the instructions. When an agent commits an unlawful act on the instructions of the principal, as a general rule both the agent and the principal are liable for the unlawful act.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-30\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-6\">Competence</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-79\">An agent has a duty to use reasonable care, skill, and diligence in carrying out her agency duties. The level of care required of an agent is that of a reasonably prudent person who has the same skills as the agent. Thus, an agent must use the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person with the same skills would use in the same or similar circumstances. An agent who fails to use reasonable care in carrying out her agency duties has breached a fiduciary duty owed to the principal.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-31\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-7\">Accounting</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-80\">An agent has a duty to account to the principal for all money that comes into the agent’s possession as a result of the agency relationship. An agent must account to the principal within a reasonable time after receiving money, as well as when the agency relationship terminates. An agent must also keep proper records. Additionally, most states and other common law jurisdictions require that the principal’s money be kept in an account separate from the agent’s money.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-32\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-8\">Principal’s Remedies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-81\">An agent who fails to carry out the terms of the agency agreement is in breach of the agreement. For example, if an agent exceeds his actual authority and binds the principal to a contract with a third party, the agent has breached the agency agreement. Similarly, if an agent fails to carry out a fiduciary duty owed to the principal, the principal generally may consider the failure to be a breach of the agency agreement.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-82\">An agent’s breach of the agency agreement provides the principal with legal justification for terminating the agency relationship. In addition, such a breach gives the principal the right to recover damages for the losses that resulted from the breach.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Principals, unlike agents, are not fiduciaries in an agency relationship. However, the law does impose certain duties on principals. For example, when an agent is an employee of the principal, the principal must comply with applicable employment laws.

If the parties do not agree on compensation in advance, the principal has a duty to pay the agent the reasonable value of the agent’s services. What constitutes a reasonable value for services is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances. Factors that might be considered in determining the reasonable value of an agent’s services include</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-44\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-86\">The types of services the agent provided</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-87\">Prior dealings between the parties</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-88\">Customs and trade practices of the business</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-89\">A principal has no duty to pay an agent who agrees to provide services without compensation.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-36\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-10\">Reimbursement</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-90\">The parties may agree as to whether the principal will reimburse the agent for expenses the agent incurs in carrying out agency duties. A principal generally has a duty to reimburse an agent for all reasonable expenses incurred in performing agency duties unless the agency agreement provides otherwise. Whether an expense is reasonable is a question of fact.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-37\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-11\">Indemnification</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-91\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-indemnification\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-25\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Indemnification</span> means the compensation or reimbursement of another person’s loss. A principal generally has a duty to indemnify an agent for any losses the agent incurs while performing his duties as long as the loss was not the result of the agent’s negligence or misconduct.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-92\">A principal’s duty to indemnify an agent usually arises in situations in which the agent’s liability results from no fault of the agent and while the agent is following the principal’s instructions. For example, assume an agent followed his principal’s instructions and entered into a contract with a third party. If the agent was held personally liable on the contract and was forced to pay money to the third party, the principal has a duty to indemnify the agent for the amount the agent had to pay out under the contract.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-38\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-12\">Agent’s Remedies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-93\">If the principal breaches the agency agreement, the agent typically can terminate the contract. In addition, the agent has a legal cause of action against the principal for breach of contract. For example, if the principal fails to compensate the agent, the agent may bring a civil lawsuit to recover the amount owed.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-94\">Figure 5.3 summarizes the

In this section we describe some of these issues.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-58\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-13\">Principal’s Contract Liability</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-116\">Whether a principal is bound to a contract made by an agent depends on whether the principal was disclosed, partially disclosed, or undisclosed. Also relevant is whether the agent was acting within the scope of his actual or apparent authority. These concepts are discussed below.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-59\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch5-h4-3\">Disclosed, Partially Disclosed, and Undisclosed Principal</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-117\">When an agent enters into a contract with a third party on behalf of a named principal, the principal is known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-disclosedprincipal\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-35\" role=\"doc-glossref\">disclosed principal</span>. When the named parties to a contract are the disclosed principal and the third party, the principal is liable under the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-118\">Occasionally, an agent contracts in her own name with a third party on behalf of a partially disclosed or an undisclosed principal.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-119\">When an agent contracts on behalf of a principal but does not identify the principal in the contract, the principal is known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-partiallydisclosedprincipal\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-36\" role=\"doc-glossref\">partially disclosed principal</span>. In this case, the agent discloses that he is acting on behalf of a principal, but the principal is not named as a party to the contract. For example, a person appoints an agent to bid on her behalf at an art auction, and the agent reveals he is acting on behalf of another person whose name he does not reveal.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-120\">When an agent purports to act on his own behalf and does not mention the existence of a principal, the principal is known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-undisclosedprincipal\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">undisclosed principal</span>. For example, a large, well-known corporation appoints an agent to make offers to purchase multiple tracts of land from several different sellers. If the sellers knew that this corporation was making the offers, the sellers might raise their asking price. Therefore, the corporation instructs the agent not to disclose that she is acting on behalf of another party.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-121\">In the above cases, the third party may enforce the contract against the partially disclosed or undisclosed principal. The principal may enforce the contract against the third party <em>only</em> if the agent acted within the scope of her actual authority.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-60\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch5-h4-4\">Actual and Apparent Authority</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-122\">An agent’s authority to bind the principal may be actual authority or apparent authority. We described an agent’s <em>actual authority</em> earlier in the chapter. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-apparentauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-38\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Apparent authority</span> is authority that is not expressly conferred on an agent, or not implicitly included with that express authority, but is authority that the principal either intentionally or negligently allows a third party to believe the agent possesses. In the case of both actual and apparent authority, the principal is bound by the agent’s act. An agent is deemed to have had apparent authority when (1) the principal allows the third party to reasonably believe that the agent has authority to bind the principal and (2) the third party relies on the appearance of that authority.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-123\">An agent’s apparent authority is created by intentional or negligent acts of the principal. Although it is sometimes difficult for a third party to know the scope of an agent’s actual authority, third parties must act reasonably and prudently to protect themselves. A third party, therefore, cannot rely solely on the appearances created by an agent and has a duty to use reasonable care to determine the scope of the agent’s actual authority.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-124\">Whether an agent had actual or apparent authority to bind a principal is a question of fact. The third party bears the burden of proving that the agent had actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the principal. While actual authority is created by a principal’s representations to an <em>agent</em>, apparent authority is created by a principal’s actions or representations to a <em>third party</em>. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-representation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-39\" role=\"doc-glossref\">representation</span> is a statement made by a contracting party that is influential in inducing the other party to enter the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-125\">Most common law jurisdictions require a showing of the following three elements to prove apparent authority:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-126\">A representation by the principal to a third party, or an act by the principal evidencing consent to the exercise of authority</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-127\">A reliance on that representation or act by the third party</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-128\">A change in position by the third party in reliance on that representation or act</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-61\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-129\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-62\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-130\">A principal who established a pattern of honoring purchase orders signed by an employee may have created apparent authority for that purpose, whether or not the employee had actual authority to sign purchase orders.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-131\">If an agent is found to have had either actual or apparent authority, the principal is bound by that agent’s act, as shown in Figure 5.4.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1155px;\" id=\"figure5-4\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-132\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-40\">Figure 5.4</span> Actual and Apparent Authority</p> <img alt=\"Actual and Apparent Authority\" id=\"loma311-ch5-img-83\" src=\"../../imgs/5-4figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-63\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure5-4\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-41\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-64\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure5-4\" id=\"loma311-ch5-a-20\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 5-4 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-133\">When an agent enters into a contract with a third party on a principal’s behalf <em>without actual or apparent authority</em> to bind the principal, the contract generally is not binding on the principal. In this situation, the principal may reject or accept the contract. The principal accepts such a contract by ratifying the agent’s unauthorized actions. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-ratification\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-42\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Ratification</span> is the adoption by a principal of an act that was taken on the principal’s behalf but without the principal’s authorization. By ratifying a contract, the principal affirms that he is a party to the contract. The contract is then effective as of the date it was originally entered into by the agent and the third party.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-134\">A principal may ratify an unauthorized act even if there was no agency relationship with the purported agent. In such a case, ratification of the unauthorized action creates an agency relationship known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-agencybyratification\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-43\" role=\"doc-glossref\">agency by ratification</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-135\">For a ratification to be effective, these requirements must be met:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-136\">A principal can ratify only those contracts that she could have authorized. A principal, for example, cannot ratify an illegal contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-53\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-137\">The agent must have purported to act on behalf of a principal. If an agent purported to act on his own behalf without disclosing the existence of the principal, the principal cannot ratify the agent’s unauthorized acts.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-54\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-138\">Before ratifying such a contract, the principal must have full knowledge of all of the material facts surrounding the transaction.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-55\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-139\">The principal must ratify the entire contract. She must accept both the favorable and unfavorable terms of the contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-56\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-140\">The principal must ratify the contract within a reasonable time. Furthermore, the third party may withdraw from the contract at any time before it is ratified. Thus, if the third party withdraws from the contract before it is ratified, any subsequent attempt at ratification by the principal has no effect.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-141\">Depending on the circumstances, a principal’s ratification may be either express or implied and may consist of words or conduct. For example, if the principal begins to perform the contract according to its terms, that performance indicates that the principal has ratified the contract. The principal’s silence may be ratification if the facts are such that the principal would be expected to object if she did not intend to ratify the contract. Whether a principal ratified an unauthorized act is a question of fact.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-65\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-14\">Principal’s Tort Liability</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-142\">As we saw in Chapter 3, the law distinguishes between employees and independent contractors. An agent may be either an employee of the principal or an independent contractor. A business might appoint an employee as an agent who is authorized to contract on behalf of the business or the business might appoint someone other than an employee to do so.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-143\">The principal’s duties and liabilities with respect to an agent vary depending on whether the agent is the principal’s employee or an independent contractor. Employers must comply with the applicable jurisdiction’s employment laws. If an agent is considered an employee under a given employment law, the principal-agent relationship must comply with that law. In addition, whether an agent acted in a given situation as an employee or an independent contractor determines the extent of a principal’s vicarious liability.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-144\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-vicariousliability\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-44\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Vicarious liability</span> is indirect liability. As a general rule, every person is responsible for his own acts. Thus, all individuals are personally liable for the torts they commit. Generally, an employer has no vicarious liability for the torts of an independent contractor. In contrast, when an employee commits a tort in the course of employment, the employer also is liable for the tort. In other words, the employer is vicariously liable for the harm that resulted from the tort even though the employer may not have been directly at fault. Thus, from a legal standpoint, the actions of many employees in a life insurance company can have an impact on the company. As we saw in Chapter 1, an effective compliance and ethics program along with a strong corporate culture provides important safeguards against such liability. The insight below describes vicarious liability in more detail.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-66\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Vicarious Liability\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch5-img-84\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-145\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-67\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-146\">Vicarious Liability</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-147\">The legal concept of vicarious liability grew out of a common law doctrine known as <em>respondeat superior</em>, which means “let the master answer.” Although employees are personally liable for their own torts, they often do not have the financial resources to compensate people they injure. In addition, because the employer profits from the employee’s employment, the employer is liable to a third party who is injured as a result of that employment.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-148\">A person injured as a result of another’s tortious conduct faces a number of legal hurdles in winning a lawsuit against the wrongdoer’s employer. First, the employer generally will have vicarious liability only if the wrongdoer was its employee. If the individual was an employee, the injured party also must prove that when the injury occurred, the wrongdoer was acting within the course of his employment.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-68\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-149\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-150\"> <p class=\"fig-inset\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-151\">Assume that Kate Hart was employed by Sound Insurance. While on vacation, Ms. Hart negligently caused an automobile accident and injured another person. Because the accident and resulting injuries had nothing to do with Ms. Hart’s employment, Sound Insurance is not vicariously liable to the injured person. By contrast, if the accident had occurred while Ms. Hart was carrying out her job duties, Sound Insurance likely would have vicarious liability.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-152\">Deciding if an individual was acting in the course of her employment can be complicated. Courts typically consider these questions:</p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-69\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-70\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-57\">Was the employee’s conduct the kind of conduct she was hired to perform?</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-58\">Did the tortious event occur during the employee’s normal work time?</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-59\">Did the event occur at a place where the employee was authorized to be by her employment?</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-153\">In most states, a person who is injured as a result of a tortious act committed by an employee acting within the course of her employment may file a lawsuit against both the employee and employer or may file separate lawsuits against them. The liability of the employer and employee in such cases is known as joint and several liability. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-jointandseveralliability\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-45\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Joint and several liability</span> means that each defendant is independently liable for the entire amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff regardless of a defendant’s share of responsibility for the losses. The total amount the plaintiff can recover from all defendants is limited to the amount of damages awarded by the court.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

When an agent contracts on behalf of a disclosed principal and the principal and third party are the named parties to the contract, the agent has no personal liability under the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-159\">An agent may be personally liable under a contract to a third party if the agent contracted in her own name. When an agent contracts in her own name on behalf of a partially disclosed or an undisclosed principal, the third party can enforce the contract against the agent and/or the principal. Likewise, the agent and the principal typically can enforce the contract against the third party. If an agent acted within the scope of her actual authority and was held personally liable on a contract entered into on behalf of a partially disclosed or an undisclosed principal, the agent is entitled to be indemnified by the principal for any losses the agent incurred.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-72\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-16\">Agent’s Warranty of Authority</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-160\">An agent who acts, or purports to act, on behalf of a principal is deemed to warrant that she has authority to act for the principal and that she is acting within the scope of that authority. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-warranty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">warranty</span> is a promise or guarantee recognized by law that a statement of fact is true. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-warrantyofauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">warranty of authority</span> is a guarantee recognized by law that an agent is acting on behalf of a principal who has contractual capacity and that the agent has authority to act for the principal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-161\">If an agent does not have actual authority to act on behalf of the principal, the third party has a cause of action against the agent for breach of the warranty of authority. For example, if an agent enters into an unauthorized contract on behalf of the principal, the principal is not bound by the agent’s acts. If the principal rejects the contract and chooses not to ratify it, the third party has a cause of action against the agent for breach of the warranty of authority.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-162\">Most common law jurisdictions require a showing of the following three elements to prove a breach of warranty of authority:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-63\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-163\">An agent represents that he has authority to act on behalf of a principal.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-64\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-164\">No such authority actually exists.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-65\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-165\">A third party relies on that misrepresentation to his detriment.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-73\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-17\">Agent’s Tort Liability</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-166\">As we have seen, every person is personally liable for his own torts. As a result, an agent who commits a tort while carrying out his agency duties is liable for the harm caused by the tort. For example, if an agent makes material misrepresentations and the third party is injured as a result, the third party may recover from the agent for the damages caused by the misrepresentations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-167\">Watch Video 5.1 for a summary of the relationship between principals, agents, and third parties.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video5-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-168\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-48\">Video 5.1</span> Principal and Agent Relationships with Third Parties</p> <div class=\"video-container\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-74\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-75\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-169\">Principal and Agent Relationships with Third Parties</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/5-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

In some cases, however, an agent continues to have apparent authority to bind the principal even after the agency relationship terminates. An agency relationship can terminate by</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-18\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-73\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-189\">An act of one of the parties</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-190\">Mutual agreement of the parties</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-191\">Performance of the agency agreement</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-192\">Operation of law</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-193\">The method by which an agency relationship terminates affects the rights and liabilities of the principal, the agent, and any third parties who then deal with the agent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-194\">Note that termination of an agency relationship must be distinguished from termination of an employment relationship. Employment relationships are governed by federal and state laws, such as those described in Chapter 3. Thus, termination of an agency relationship when the agent is an employee is governed by both employment law and agency law.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-105\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-18\">Termination by Act of a Party</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-195\">Because agency is a relationship requiring the consent of both parties, either party has the power to end the relationship at any time. A party, however, may have the <em>power</em> to end the relationship but not the <em>legal right</em> to do so. For example, assume that a principal and an agent enter into an agency agreement that is for a term of one year. Either party has the power to end the relationship at any time during that year, but neither has the legal right to do so without the other’s consent. A party who ends an agency relationship without the legal right to do so is in breach of the agency agreement and is liable to the other party for any damages that result from the breach.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-196\">As we have noted, if an agent breaches a fiduciary duty, the principal has the right to terminate the agency relationship without having further liability to the agent. Similarly, when an agent has the legal right to terminate the agency relationship, the agent may do so without having further liability to the principal. For example, an agent typically has a legal right to end the agency relationship when the principal fails to compensate the agent per the terms of the agency agreement.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-106\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-19\">Termination by Mutual Agreement</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-197\">An agent and a principal have the legal right to agree to end the agency relationship at any time without incurring further legal liability to each other. This is true whether the agency agreement included a termination provision or not. As long as both parties agree, they have the legal right to end their relationship at any time and on any terms they desire.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-107\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-20\">Termination by Performance of Agreement</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-198\">Many agency agreements state that they are to continue until a specified date or until a specified purpose is accomplished. When an agency agreement contains a termination provision, the agreement terminates upon the occurrence of the condition specified. Neither party has a duty to notify the other party of the termination or to take any action for the termination to be effective. When an agency agreement has been performed, the parties have no further liabilities or duties to each other.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-199\">When an agency agreement does not have a termination provision, the relationship terminates after a reasonable time. What constitutes a reasonable time is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances surrounding the agency relationship. An agency relationship that is to continue for an unspecified amount of time is known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch5-gt-agencyatwill\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch5-span-67\" role=\"doc-glossref\">agency at will</span>. Either the principal or agent has the legal right to terminate an agency at will at any time and for any reason by giving the other party notice of termination of the relationship. If the amount of notice required is not stated in the agency agreement, the terminating party must give a reasonable amount of notice. The amount of time that constitutes reasonable notice is a question of fact that may be affected by a number of factors, such as the customs and trade practices of the industry.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-108\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-21\">Termination by Operation of Law</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-200\">The occurrence of certain events results in the termination of an agency relationship by operation of law. Termination by operation of law means that an agent’s authority to bind the principal automatically terminates as a result of the operation of law rather than as the result of an action of the agent or of the principal. Following are some of the events that terminate an agency relationship by operation of law:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch5-ul-19\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-201\"><strong>Either the principal or the agent dies.</strong> </p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-202\"><strong>The principal loses his contractual capacity.</strong> </p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-203\"><strong>An event makes it impossible for the agency agreement to be performed.</strong> For example, if a principal hires an agent to sell a house and the house is destroyed in a storm, the agency agreement can no longer be performed because its subject matter is gone.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch5-li-80\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch5-p-204\"><strong>The agent loses the capacity to perform the agency agreement.</strong> For example, if the agent is required to have a license to perform the agency agreement and the agent loses her license, then the agent has lost the capacity to perform the agency agreement.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-205\">Upon the occurrence of such an event, the agency relationship is terminated by operation of law. The acts of the agent are no longer binding on the principal.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-109\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch5-h3-22\">Principal’s Duty to Notify Third Parties</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-206\">A principal’s duty to notify third parties of the termination of an agency relationship depends on the reason for termination.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-110\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch5-h4-5\">Termination by Operation of Law</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-207\">When an agency relationship terminates by operation of law, the agent’s authority—actual and apparent—to bind the principal also terminates by operation of law. Because the agent’s authority automatically terminates in such cases, the principal generally has no duty to notify third parties of the termination. A third party who contracted with an agent on behalf of a principal after the agency terminated by operation of law cannot enforce the contract against the principal. Likewise, the principal cannot enforce the contract against the third party. The third party’s only recourse is against the agent. In this case, the agent may be held liable for breach of the warranty of authority because the agent acted on the principal's behalf when there was no longer an agency relationship.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch5-div-111\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch5-h4-6\">Termination by Act of One of the Parties, Mutual Agreement, or Performance of the Agreement</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-208\">When an agency relationship terminates for reasons other than by operation of law, the agent may continue to have apparent authority even though her actual authority to bind the principal has ended. Because apparent authority is created by the principal’s actions, such authority continues until the principal takes action to revoke it. Any third party who is unaware that the agency relationship ended and who enters into a contract with the agent on behalf of the principal can enforce the contract against the principal. Therefore, the principal must take steps to revoke the agent’s apparent authority by providing notice that the agent’s authority has ended. Such notice must be made to third parties who dealt with the agent during the agency relationship.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch5-p-209\">The principal also must take whatever steps are reasonable to notify third parties who did not deal with the agent but who knew of the agency relationship.

This bundle of ownership rights generally includes:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-41\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-35\">The right to enjoy and use the property</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-42\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-36\">The right to dispose of the property</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-37\">For example, assume that you own a pickup truck. Your ownership of the truck includes the exclusive right to enjoy and use the truck: to drive it, allow a family member to borrow it, use the truck to make deliveries for pay, and so on. Your ownership also includes the right to dispose of the truck, by bequeathing it, giving it away, or selling it on whatever terms you choose. You can also use the truck as security for a loan by giving a creditor a security interest in the truck. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-securityinterest\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-11\" role=\"doc-glossref\">security interest</span> is a claim against a debtor’s property that gives a creditor the right to possession of the property if the debtor defaults on the underlying loan. In the event of a default, the property can be sold to satisfy the outstanding debt.

We typically refer to the party who sells the property as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-transferor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-12\" role=\"doc-glossref\">transferor</span>, and the party who buys the property is the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-transferee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-13\" role=\"doc-glossref\">transferee</span>. In any transfer of property ownership, the new owner generally can receive only those ownership interests that the prior owner had to transfer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-39\">Sometimes a person receives property as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-gift\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-14\" role=\"doc-glossref\">gift</span>, which is a voluntary transfer of property ownership from one person to another without the exchange of consideration. The person who makes a gift is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-donor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-15\" role=\"doc-glossref\">donor</span>, and the person to whom a gift is made is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-donee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-16\" role=\"doc-glossref\">donee</span>. State laws typically require that the following three elements be present to complete a valid gift:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-43\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-40\">The donor must intend to make a gift.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-44\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-41\">The property must be delivered to the donee.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-42\">The donee must accept the property as a gift.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-43\">Another common method of acquiring property is referred to as <em>accession</em>, which means “to add to.” <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-accession\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Accession</span> means that a person generally has the right to all that his property produces and all that is added to or united with the property. The owner of land usually owns the crops that grow on the land or anything beneath the land, and the owner of a fixed annuity owns any interest that the annuity earns in addition to the principal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-44\">Property can be lost, abandoned, or stolen. In these cases, determining who has the right to claim title to the property can be difficult. In this context, <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-title\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">title</span> is a person’s claim to ownership of property that is superior to anyone else’s ownership claim. The following general rules govern abandoned and lost property:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-45\">When someone <em>abandons</em> property and no longer intends to possess it, whoever claims the property becomes the owner.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-46\">When someone <em>loses</em> property by negligently or accidently misplacing it, that person continues to own the property. Anyone who finds the property has the right to keep it until the rightful owner is located. The finder in such a case has a superior claim to the property over anyone other than the rightful owner.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-47\">When someone receives or buys property that was <em>stolen</em>, the transferee receives no title because the transferor did not have title to transfer. Such goods remain the property of the rightful owner.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-48\">To protect buyers from unscrupulous practices, sometimes the common law grants a buyer more rights and better title in property than the seller possessed. For example, a <em>good faith purchaser for value</em> generally takes property free of any unknown lien or interest in the property held by another party. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-lien\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">lien</span> is a generic term used to describe a claim against property resulting from a debt or other obligation. The law protects the good faith purchaser from unknowingly losing property to a claim that the seller did not fairly reveal. Two elements are necessary for a buyer to qualify as a good faith purchaser for value:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-49\"><em>The buyer must make the purchase in good faith with no knowledge that anyone other than the seller has an ownership interest in the property.</em> For example, if a buyer could have discovered such an interest by exercising reasonable care, then the buyer does not qualify as a good faith purchaser.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-50\"><em>The buyer must pay a valuable consideration in exchange for the property</em>. Thus, someone who receives property as a gift does not qualify as a good faith purchaser for value.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-6\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-51\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-7\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-52\">Gabriella Veluz borrowed money from Thomas Drake. To secure the debt, Ms. Veluz gave Mr. Drake a lien on a piece of property she owned. Mr. Drake never filed the lien against the property in the county lands return office. Ms. Veluz later sold the property to Anna Murphy. Because Ms. Murphy was a good faith purchaser for value, Mr. Drake’s lien on the property terminated. Although Mr. Drake may seek repayment of the loan from Ms. Veluz, he has no claim against the property after Ms. Veluz sold the property to a good faith purchaser for value.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-8\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-2\">Forms of Property Ownership</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-53\">As a general rule, any individual, business, or government entity can own property. Special rules apply to property that is owned by more than one person. In most states, more than one individual can hold property in the following forms:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-54\">In a<em> tenancy in common,</em> two or more parties each own an undivided portion of the property. Assume, for example, that two sisters own land as tenants in common. One sister has a one-third interest and the other has a two-thirds interest in the land. Each tenant has an equal right to possess and use the property, and each has the right to sell or otherwise transfer ownership of her undivided interest in the property. Each tenant also has the right to decide who will receive her interest in the property following her death.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-55\">In a <em>joint tenancy</em>, two or more individuals own equal shares in property and have a right of survivorship. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-rightofsurvivorship\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-20\" role=\"doc-glossref\">right of survivorship</span> means that, when one joint tenant dies, his share automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant or tenants. Like tenants in common, joint tenants each have the right to possess and use the property, and a joint tenant may transfer his ownership interest to a third party. Such a transfer ends the joint tenancy, however, and creates a tenancy in common. Thus, the remaining owner and the new owner become tenants in common.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-56\">As part of their laws governing marriages, most countries have enacted laws that govern the ownership of property by married couples. In the United States, many states recognize a <em>tenancy by the entirety</em>, in which both spouses have the right to possess and use the property and ownership determines the right of survivorship. Neither spouse can transfer ownership of the property without the consent of the other. If the parties divorce, then the tenancy by the entirety is dissolved and the parties usually own the property as tenants in common.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-57\">A few states have enacted community property laws that govern property ownership between spouses. In a community property state, the law treats a married couple as a community. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-communityproperty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Community property</span> is certain property owned by a married couple in which each spouse has an undivided half interest. For example, assume that a husband is employed outside the home and the wife stays home to raise the children. The income the husband earns during the marriage is community property. Any property that the couple buys with community property during the marriage, such as a house and automobiles, becomes community property also.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-58\">By contrast, community property law considers some property to be a married person’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-separateproperty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-22\" role=\"doc-glossref\">separate property</span>, which belongs entirely to the individual. The following general rules dictate when property is separate:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-53\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-59\">Property an individual obtained before marriage remains that person’s separate property.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-54\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-60\">Property acquired during a marriage with separate property is that spouse’s separate property. For example, assume that a woman owned a car at the time she got married. The car is her separate property, and any money she receives for selling the car is also her separate property.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-55\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-61\">Property acquired by one spouse during a marriage as a gift or inheritance is the separate property of that spouse.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-62\">As a general rule, both spouses must agree before ownership of community property may be transferred to a third party. When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse is entitled to half of the community property. The other half generally belongs to the estate of the deceased spouse.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-9\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-63\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-10\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-64\">When she married, Mrs. Singh owned a paid-up insurance policy on her own life. After she married, she named her sister as the beneficiary of the policy. Because she owned the policy before the marriage, the policy is Mrs. Singh’s separate property in which her husband has no ownership rights.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-65\">A married couple community ends upon (1) the death of either spouse, (2) the divorce of the parties, or (3) the annulment of the marriage. When a community ends, the couple’s community property is divided between the parties, equally or as they otherwise agree.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-11\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-3\">Restrictions on Ownership</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-66\">A person who holds all of the legal rights that exist in certain property is the absolute owner of the property. An owner’s rights in property, however, are not always absolute, because property rights may be subject to some governmental restrictions. In the United States, most state legislatures have delegated to cities and other local governments the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-policepower\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-23\" role=\"doc-glossref\">police power</span>, which is the power to enact laws to promote public health, safety, and welfare. Examples of a local government’s use of police power with regard to property include zoning laws and building codes. For instance, a local government might zone a portion of land for use as commercial property as opposed to residential property.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-67\">An owner’s rights also may be limited if another person has rights in the same property. Because property is a bundle of rights, the owner may transfer any or all of those rights to others. For example, when a property owner uses the property as collateral for a loan, he gives the creditor an interest in the property. We discuss the rights of creditors further in Chapter 12.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-2-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-2\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-68\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-14\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-2-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-69\">All but one of the following statements about transfers are correct.

Many financial products, such as stocks, are intangible property that commonly changes hands during a testamentary transfer.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-24\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-4\">Testamentary Transfers</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-81\">An important right of property ownership is the owner’s right to decide who will receive the property when the owner dies. An individual who dies is referred to as a <em>decedent</em>. A decedent’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-estate\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">estate</span> includes all of the property that the individual owned at her death. Ownership of some property in that estate automatically passes by operation of law or contract. For example, when two people own property jointly with a right of survivorship, then upon one person’s death, ownership passes automatically to the surviving joint owner. If any property owned by a decedent does not pass at her death automatically by operation of law or contract, that property forms the person’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-probateestate\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-35\" role=\"doc-glossref\">probate estate</span>.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-25\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch6-h4-1\">Wills</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-82\">A person can determine who will receive the property in his probate estate by executing a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-will\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-36\" role=\"doc-glossref\">will</span>, which is a legal document that directs how the person’s property is to be distributed after his death. The term <em>will</em> once referred to the document governing the decedent’s real property, while the term <em>testament</em> referred to the document governing the decedent’s personal property. A will is still sometimes called the last will and testament for this reason. The person who makes a will is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-testator\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">testator</span>, and a person who dies with a valid will is said to die <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-testate\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-38\" role=\"doc-glossref\">testate</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-83\">The types of wills and the formalities required for wills vary from country to country. In the United States, laws in each state set out the requirements that must be met in order for a will to be valid. Typically, a person’s will must be executed—signed—in accordance with the requirements of the applicable laws in the state in which the person is domiciled. A person’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-domicile\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-39\" role=\"doc-glossref\">domicile</span>is that place where the person has her true, fixed, and permanent home. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-84\">Most states require the following formalities for a will to be valid:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-56\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-85\">A will must be in writing.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-57\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-86\">The testator must have the legal capacity to make a will, referred to as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-testamentarycapacity\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-40\" role=\"doc-glossref\">testamentary capacity</span>. As a general rule, anyone who has attained a stated age, typically 18, and is of sound mind has testamentary capacity. For purposes of making a will, a person is considered to be of sound mind if she (1) understands the nature and character of the property she owns, (2) understands that she is making a will, and (3) recognizes the people who would be expected to be provided for in her will.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-58\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-87\">The will must be signed by the testator or by someone else who signs on behalf of the testator, at the testator’s direction, and in the testator’s presence.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-59\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-88\">The testator must sign the will in the presence of competent witnesses or must attest to the witnesses that it is her signature. Witnesses generally are competent if they have attained a specified age, usually 18, and if they are disinterested parties who are not beneficiaries of the will.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-60\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-89\">The witnesses must sign the will in the presence of the testator.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-90\">Because a will does not become effective until the testator’s death, a testator may revoke a will at any time before her death. For example, a testator may revoke a will by executing a subsequent valid will. A testator may also revise a valid will by executing a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-codicil\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-41\" role=\"doc-glossref\">codicil</span>, which is a testamentary document that supplements a will. Because it is a testamentary document, a codicil must be executed with the same formalities that are required to execute a valid will. A testator can use a codicil to add to the provisions of a will, to revoke or alter provisions, and to explain or qualify provisions. For example, a testator may use a codicil to dispose of property she acquired after she executed her will.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-26\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch6-h4-2\">Intestate Succession</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-91\">A person who dies without a valid will is said to die <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-intestate\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-42\" role=\"doc-glossref\">intestate</span>, and that person is known as an intestate. Intestate succession laws in each state specify the individuals who are entitled to the probate estate of individuals who die intestate. In addition, if a person dies testate but fails to dispose of all of his property in a valid will, then the remaining property is distributed in accordance with the intestate succession law. For conflict of laws purposes, the distribution of an intestate’s real property is governed by the laws of the state in which the property is located. The distribution of an intestate’s personal property is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the person was domiciled at the time of his death.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-92\">Most countries have intestate succession laws, which provide that property passes to a person’s close family members—including surviving spouse, children and other descendants, and parents—in a specified order of priority. For example, in the United States, most states have adopted laws based on the Uniform Probate Code. The purpose of intestate succession laws is to distribute the intestate’s property in a manner that closely represents how the average person would have passed on his property had that person created a will. However, these laws are inflexible, and they vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. As a result, an intestate’s property often is not passed on as the person would have wished.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-27\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch6-h4-3\">Estate Administration</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-93\">Each state has established procedures for handling the distribution of the estates of deceased persons. That process, referred to as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-probateprocess\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-43\" role=\"doc-glossref\">probate process</span>, typically is conducted under the supervision of a local court, which usually is known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-probatecourt\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-44\" role=\"doc-glossref\">probate court</span>. Typically, the probate court that has authority to oversee the probate of a will is the probate court of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the time of her death. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-94\">In each case, the court appoints a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-personalrepresentative\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-45\" role=\"doc-glossref\">personal representative</span> as the person who is responsible for settling the decedent’s estate. A will typically names the person the testator wants the court to appoint as the personal representative. The personal representative is known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-executor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">executor</span>when a decedent dies with a valid will. In the case of an intestate decedent, the personal representative is appointed by the court, and typically is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-administrator\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">administrator</span> of the decedent’s estate. The personal representative is responsible for collecting and completing an inventory of the decedent’s property. The representative is also responsible for filing any required income tax returns, collecting all debts owed to the decedent, and paying all outstanding debts owed by the decedent. The personal representative then distributes any remaining property to the people who are determined by the probate court to be entitled to it in accordance with either the terms of the decedent’s will or the applicable laws of intestate succession. Life insurance policy proceeds may play a role in this distribution, as we’ll examine further later in this course. </p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-4-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-4\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-95\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-42\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-4-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-96\">When a person dies without a valid will, they are said to die (<strong>testate</strong> / <strong>intestate</strong>).

We use the term <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-intellectualproperty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-53\" role=\"doc-glossref\">intellectual property</span>to refer to intangible personal property that is a product of the human intellect and in which the creator has ownership rights. Individuals and businesses that express ideas in some tangible or artistic form have specific ownership rights in that intellectual property. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-102\">Advances in communication technology have made it easier than ever before to violate, however accidentally, a business’ or person’s intellectual property rights. For example, a person can electronically copy the text from a work in a matter of seconds and present that work as her own. A company must be careful in its many communications to avoid using someone else’s intellectual property. Therefore, a company must be aware of the laws that protect the ownership rights specific to intellectual property. Such laws generally include copyright laws, patent laws, and trademark laws.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-103\">Generally, an insurance company’s products do not qualify for intellectual property rights. However, an insurance company typically owns many types of intellectual property, such as images or a company logo. Some unique devices, computer applications, or other business methods may also qualify as intellectual property.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-36\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-5\">Copyrights</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-104\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-copyright\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-54\" role=\"doc-glossref\">copyright</span> is a right that is granted by statute to the author or originator of an original literary or artistic work and that gives the copyright holder the exclusive right to publish, produce, or perform the right for a specified time. Copyrights are granted for works such as books, fine and graphic arts, music, records, photography, software, video, cinema, and choreography.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-105\">In the United States, copyrights are governed by federal law, which provides that copyright protection attaches to a work when it is first created. For works created after January 1, 1978, an author or originator has copyright protection in the work for his lifetime and for 70 years thereafter. Figure 6.1 gives some examples of the length of copyright protection—including the duration of the author’s life—in other countries. In each case, a copyright granted under a given jurisdiction’s laws is enforceable only within that jurisdiction. Thus, for example, an author who publishes a novel in the United States and several other countries is granted a separate copyright in each country.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1231px;\" id=\"figure6-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-106\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-55\">Figure 6.1</span> Copyright Laws around the World</p> <img alt=\"Copyright Laws around the World\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-60\" src=\"../../imgs/6-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-37\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure6-1\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-56\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-38\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure6-1\" id=\"loma311-ch6-a-16\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 6-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-107\">Because U.S. copyright protection attaches when a work is created, an author or originator does not need to take special action to protect the work. Copyright holders typically include a copyright notice on their works to notify others of the copyright. Holders are permitted, but not required, to register their copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office at any time during the time of copyright protection.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-108\">Any violation of an author’s exclusive rights in a work constitutes an infringement of the author’s copyright. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-infringement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-57\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Infringement</span> means any violation of the exclusive rights belonging to the owner of intellectual property. If a third party infringes a copyright, the copyright holder has a cause of action against the infringer under the federal copyright law. The holder of a copyright may sue for an injunction, but the holder must register her copyright to file a lawsuit for statutory damages. By registering a copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office, the owner gains the following benefits:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-109\">The copyright holder may file a lawsuit against the infringer of her copyright.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-62\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-110\">If someone infringes a copyright after it has been registered, the copyright holder is entitled to recover damages from the infringers and can elect to receive either her actual damages or statutory damages. If a work was not registered at the time of the infringement, the copyright holder generally is entitled to recover only her actual damages, including all profits the infringer earned as a result of the infringement.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-63\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-111\">A certificate of registration, obtained before or within five years after publication of the work, constitutes prima facie evidence that the copyright is valid. If the copyright holder has this certificate, she is not required to produce evidence at trial to prove the validity of the copyright.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-112\">In addition to awarding damages, the courts may issue an injunction that prohibits further infringements of the plaintiff’s copyright.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-113\">A copyright does not grant unlimited ownership rights. The primary limitation on these rights is the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-fairusedoctrine\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-58\" role=\"doc-glossref\">fair use doctrine</span>, which is a legal doctrine that permits others to use limited portions of a copyrighted work for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-39\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-6\">Patents</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-114\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-patent\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-59\" role=\"doc-glossref\">patent</span> is a governmental grant of property rights to the inventor or creator of an original process, machine, manufactured article, or chemical compound. In the United States, the federal government has authority to issue patents, and federal laws specify the requirements that an invention must meet to receive a patent. Unlike copyrights, which attach upon the creation of a work, a patent is effective only after the applicable government agency acts on an application for a patent. Because U.S. law recognizes that business methods may be patented, some insurers do file for U.S. patents. For example, an insurance company can file for a patent for a unique method for calculating and making distributions for a variable annuity.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-115\">To get a U.S. patent, an inventor must file an application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The information provided in the application should demonstrate in detail that the invention meets the requirements for a patent. For example, an invention must be something new, which means that it must add to existing knowledge. Obtaining a patent is an expensive and time-consuming process that usually takes several years.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-40\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Who Owns a Copyright or Patent?\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-61\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-116\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-41\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-117\">Who Owns a Copyright or Patent?</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-118\">A copyrightable work or a patentable invention is created by an individual or a group of individuals. But often, a business has hired those individuals to create the work or invention. In such cases, who is entitled to ownership of the work—the individual creators or the businesses that funded the work?</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-119\">Under U.S. federal copyright laws, the author or creator of a work owns the work unless it was created as a work for hire. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-workforhire\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-60\" role=\"doc-glossref\">work for hire</span> is a work prepared (1) by an employee within the course of his employment or (2) as the result of a work-for-hire agreement between the parties. The employer, not the employee, is the owner of a copyright of a work for hire.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-120\">U.S. federal patent laws approach the issue somewhat differently. Only the inventor or inventors may apply for a patent on their inventions. However, an inventor may assign ownership of the patent to another party. A business that employs an inventor typically obtains ownership of patent rights in an invention when the individual inventor assigns ownership of those rights to the business.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-121\">Like copyrights, a patent generally is effective only within the country that granted the patent. To eliminate the potential time and expense of having to file multiple patent applications in several different countries, the <em>Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)</em> provides a method of obtaining international patent protection. Under the PCT, a person can file one application and pay one filing fee and can request patents from any or all of the more than 110 countries that have signed the PCT. The inventor can generally file applications with his national patent office. Each country retains the right to evaluate the application and issue a patent that is effective within its jurisdiction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-122\">When a patent application is filed under the PCT, one of the patent offices participating in the treaty conducts an international search to learn whether other patents already exist that would affect the patentability of the invention. The search helps the applicant decide whether it is likely that his invention is patentable and whether to continue the patent process.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-123\">A patent gives its owner the right to exclude others from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing the patented invention in the applicable jurisdiction during the term of the patent. A U.S. patent typically is granted for a period of 20 years from the date the patent application was filed. Anyone who makes, uses, sells, offers to sell, or imports a patented invention within the United States during the term of the patent without permission from the patent owner has infringed the patent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-124\">When a valid patent is infringed, the patent holder is entitled to various remedies. The court may issue an injunction that prohibits the infringers from continuing the infringement. The patent holder also is entitled to damages, and the court may award treble damages if the infringement was intentional or willful. Court costs and attorneys’ fees also may be awarded to a successful plaintiff.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-42\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-7\">Trademarks</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-125\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-trademark\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-61\" role=\"doc-glossref\">trademark</span> is a word, phrase, symbol, design, or combination thereof that identifies and distinguishes the source of one party’s goods from those of other parties. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-servicemark\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-62\" role=\"doc-glossref\">service mark</span> is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods. The term <em>mark</em> is used to refer to both trademarks and service marks. The most common thing an insurance company trademarks is its company logo.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-126\">In the United States, individuals and businesses may use any mark they choose to identify the source of their goods and services, as long as it does not infringe another’s mark. By using a mark to identify goods or services, a person or business establishes property rights in the mark. To further protect their property rights in a mark, however, individuals and businesses generally register their marks with the USPTO.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-127\">A person who wants to register a mark must file an application with the USPTO, which evaluates the information in the application to determine whether the applicant meets the statutory requirements for registering a mark. The primary consideration is whether the mark is so similar to an existing mark that it is likely to cause confusion as to the source of the goods or services. If confusion is likely, the USPTO rejects the application. The following insight illustrates some of the advantages of registering a mark in the United States.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-43\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Advantages of U.S. Registration of a Mark\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-62\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-128\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-44\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-129\">Advantages of U.S. Registration of a Mark</p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-45\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-46\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-18\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-64\">A legal presumption is created that the registrant owns the mark and has the exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection with the goods and/or services listed in the registration.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-65\">The registrant gains the ability to bring an action in federal court concerning the mark.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-66\">The U.S. registration can be used as a basis to obtain registration in foreign countries.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-67\">The U.S. registration can be filed with the U.S. Customs Service to prevent the importation of foreign goods bearing an infringing mark.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-130\">A U.S. trademark or service mark registration generally remains in force for 10 years. Registrations can be renewed for additional 10-year periods by paying the applicable fee and filing with the USPTO an affidavit attesting to the registrant’s continuing use of the mark.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-131\">A person who claims rights in a mark can use the TM (trademark) or SM (service mark) designation to alert the public to her claim, regardless of whether she has filed an application with the USPTO. After a mark has been registered, the registrant can give notice to others of its ownership claim by displaying with the mark the words <em>Registered in U.S. Patent and Trademark Office</em>, or <em>Reg U.S. Pat. &amp; Tm. Off</em>., or the letter R enclosed within a circle: ®.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-132\">A mark is infringed when someone, without the consent of the mark’s owner, uses a copy or imitation of a mark to sell, distribute, or advertise a product or service and such use is likely to cause confusion, cause a mistake, or deceive the public. If the mark has been registered, the registrant may file a lawsuit in federal court and may be entitled to an injunction to prevent further use of the infringing mark. If the infringing acts were committed with knowledge that use of the imitation is likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception, then the registrant is entitled to recover money damages.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-133\">The owner of a trademark or service mark must be vigilant to protect that property. Owners can lose the exclusive right to use a trademark or service mark if a challenger successfully shows that the term has become generic, and considered by the public to represent the product rather than the producer. For that reason, many companies will require the identifiers TM, SM, or ® on each usage. Most companies provide templates for various forms, letterheads, presentations, and other types of communication so that the company’s employees can help identify and protect the company’s trademarked intellectual property.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-5-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-5\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-134\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-63\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-5-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-135\">An insurer typically registers its logo so that other companies cannot use its logo without infringement.

Commercial transactions are interactions in which two or more parties exchange something of value—not just goods or other forms of property, but also services—for some type of remuneration. Many types of commercial transactions take place across jurisdictional lines, especially as improvements in communications technology make such transactions easier than ever. To create uniformity in transactions of this nature, all states have enacted statutes based on the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-uniformcommercialcode\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-67\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)</span>, which is a model law created by the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to govern commercial transactions. The UCC is divided into the following nine articles:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-19\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-68\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-141\"><strong>Article 1</strong> contains definitions of commercial law terms and general rules of construction that apply to transactions under most of the provisions of the UCC.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-69\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-142\"><strong>Article 2</strong> governs contracts for the sale of goods, or tangible personal property.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-143\"><strong>Article 3</strong> governs negotiable instruments.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-71\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-144\"><strong>Article 4</strong> governs bank collections of checks and drafts.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-72\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-145\"><strong>Article 5</strong> governs letters of credit.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-73\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-146\"><strong>Article 6</strong> governs bulk sales, such as the sale of the entire inventory of a business.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-147\"><strong>Article 7</strong> governs domestic documents of title, such as contracts for the delivery and storage of goods.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-148\"><strong>Article 8</strong> governs transactions in investment securities.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-149\"><strong>Article 9</strong> governs secured transactions.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-150\">Many of the contracts and transactions governed by the UCC are beyond the scope of this text. Here we focus on Article 2, which covers sale of goods, and Article 3, which covers negotiable instruments.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-53\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-8\">Sale of Goods</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-151\">In the course of doing business, insurers purchase tangible property such as office furniture, office supplies, telephones, and computers. Therefore, a portion of an insurer’s operations is governed by Article 2 of the UCC, which pertains to contracts for the sale of goods. By <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-saleofgoods\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-68\" role=\"doc-glossref\">sale of goods</span>, we mean the transfer of ownership of tangible personal property in exchange for some other property, money, or services.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-152\">In the United States, Article 2 of the UCC governs contracts for the sale of goods, but it does <em>not</em> apply to contracts involving the sale of services, real estate, or intangible property (such as stock certificates, bonds, or insurance policies). The sale of such property is governed by general contract law principles, other articles of the UCC, or other state and federal laws. Under Article 2, parties generally are free to contract on whatever terms they choose and in whatever manner they choose. However, the UCC does provide some limits. For example, the courts will not enforce contract terms that are grossly unfair or one-sided.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Because trade often crosses state and national borders, individuals and businesses need to be able to complete transactions without having to pay cash. For example, it would be unreasonable for an insurer to ask a customer in another state to pay her premiums in cash. Negotiable instruments are a substitute for cash. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-negotiableinstrument\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-69\" role=\"doc-glossref\">negotiable instrument</span> is a written document that represents an unconditional promise or order to pay a specified amount of money upon the demand of the owner of the instrument. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-negotiability\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-70\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Negotiability</span>means that possession of an instrument can be transferred—or negotiated—from person to person, and the instrument generally is accepted as a substitute for cash. A negotiable instrument’s two forms are as follows: </p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-20\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-154\">An instrument that is a promise to pay a sum of money is referred to as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-note\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-71\" role=\"doc-glossref\">note</span>. By executing a note, a debtor provides a creditor with a document that can be enforced in the courts.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-155\">An instrument that is an order, or an instruction, to pay a sum of money is referred to as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-draft\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-72\" role=\"doc-glossref\">draft</span>. For example, a check is a draft that instructs a financial institution, such as a bank, to pay money from a specific account to a third person. The bank from which the money is to be withdrawn is known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-drawee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-73\" role=\"doc-glossref\">drawee</span>.

A person is the holder of a negotiable instrument if (1) he has possession of the instrument and (2) the instrument is payable to the person or “to bearer.” For example, if you have possession of a check that is payable to another person, you do not qualify as the holder of the instrument and cannot negotiate it. We describe instruments payable “to bearer” later in this section.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-56\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-9\">Required Formalities</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-159\">To be negotiable, an instrument must meet four basic requirements:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-21\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-160\">First, <em>the instrument must be in writing and must be signed by its maker</em>. The document may be handwritten, typed, or printed, and the signature may be handwritten, typed, or stamped on to the writing. As a general rule, any type of signature is acceptable as long as it shows the maker’s intent to validate the instrument. In addition, the signature must be that of the maker or someone authorized to sign on the maker’s behalf. For example, businesses authorize specific individuals to sign negotiable instruments, such as checks, on their behalf.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-80\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-161\">Second, <em>the instrument must contain an unconditional promise to pay or an unconditional order to pay</em>. A note stating “I owe you $100” is not negotiable because it does not include a promise to pay the amount owed. Likewise, a note that says “I promise to pay you $100 if you repair my garage door” is not negotiable because the promise to pay is not unconditional.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-81\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-162\">Third, <em>the amount promised or ordered to be paid must be a fixed amount of money</em>. This requirement is met whether the instrument is payable with or without interest. If the principal amount owed is clearly stated, the amount of interest payable may be stated as a fixed or variable amount or rate.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-82\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-163\">Fourth, <em>the instrument must be payable on demand or at a definite time</em>. If an instrument does not state when it is payable, then it is payable on demand. A check, for example, typically is payable whenever the payee chooses to present it for payment; thus, a check is negotiable. A note that is dated and states on its face that it is payable “30 days after date” is payable at a definite time and, thus, is negotiable. By contrast, an instrument that is payable “30 days after my death” is not negotiable because the date of the person’s death is not known. Thus, the instrument is not payable at a definite time.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-164\">As a general rule, negotiable instruments must be “payable to bearer” or “payable to order.” An instrument that is payable to bearer, known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-bearerpaper\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-79\" role=\"doc-glossref\">bearer paper</span>, is negotiable by the holder without having to be signed by a specific payee. A signed check that is payable “to cash” is considered to be payable to the bearer who can negotiate it simply by transferring its possession to another person. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-165\">An instrument that is payable to the order of a specific payee, known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-orderpaper\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-80\" role=\"doc-glossref\">order paper</span>, can be negotiated if it is indorsed—that is, signed on the back of the document—by the named payee and transferred to another. For example, a check that is “payable to the order of Jane Villard” is negotiable if Ms. Villard indorses the check and gives it to another person. Checks typically are payable to the order of a specific payee.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-166\">An instrument that is payable to a named person without specifically stating that it is “payable to the order of” the person is not negotiable. To return to the previous example, assume that when she indorsed her check, Jane Villard wrote “pay to Eduardo Guerrero” on the check. The check is now payable only to Mr. Guerrero. Because Mr. Guerrero cannot transfer the check to another person, it is no longer a negotiable instrument.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-167\">Some negotiable instruments may have legal issues. The insight below describes some of these issues and how they are typically resolved.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-57\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Legal Issues Regarding Negotiable Instruments\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-78\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-168\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-58\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-169\">Legal Issues Regarding Negotiable Instruments</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-170\">One potential legal issue with negotiable instruments arises if the instrument contains contradictory terms. In the United States, Article 3 of the UCC states the following rules:</p> <ul id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-22\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-83\">Typewritten terms prevail over printed terms.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-84\">Handwritten terms prevail over both typewritten and printed terms.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-85\">Words prevail over numbers.</li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-59\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-171\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-172\"> <p class=\"fig-inset\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-173\">Dorothy Omido wrote a check to pay her telephone bill. One portion of the check stated “$35”, but the amount written out stated “forty-five dollars.” Because the UCC provides that words prevail over numbers, the check is payable for $45.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-174\">Another potential issue is the possibility of dishonored, or bad, checks. Because the reliable flow of commerce is vital to a country’s economy, many countries have enacted laws that make it a criminal offense to write a dishonored check.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-60\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-175\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-176\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-177\">In India, writing a dishonored check is an offense punishable by up to one year in prison with fines up to double the amount of the check. Under Indian law, if a check is dishonored, a payee must give notice in writing to the drawer of the check demanding payment for the amount of the check. The drawer then has 15 days after receipt of the notice to honor the check. If he fails to do so, he is subject to criminal, as well as civil, penalties. Providing proper notice to the drawer of a dishonored check is important because only a drawer who has been given such notice can be held liable.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-61\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-10\">Indorsements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-178\">A holder negotiates an instrument by indorsing it with his signature and transferring the instrument to another person. The term <em>endorsement</em> is often used in casual English, but generally, statutes and legal writings use the more formal term <em>indorsement</em>.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-62\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-179\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-63\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-180\">Romesh Jeeva receives his monthly salary from his employer in the form of a check made payable to Romesh Jeeva. When Mr. Jeeva gets a salary check, he becomes the holder of the check. He can negotiate the check, by indorsing it on the back and depositing the funds into his own bank account, or he can indorse the check and give it to someone else as payment for an amount he owes that person.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-181\">As noted earlier, a holder typically indorses an instrument by signing the instrument on the back. The signature generally must match the holder’s name as it appears on the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two or more people jointly, then all of the named people must sign the instrument in order to negotiate it. Thus, an instrument made payable to “John and Jane Doe” must be signed by both John and Jane. By contrast, an instrument made payable to “John or Jane Doe” may be negotiated if it is indorsed by either John or Jane. When an instrument is made payable to a firm or organization, any individual authorized to act on behalf of the named firm or organization may indorse the instrument.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-182\">The way in which an instrument is indorsed determines how the instrument can be negotiated. The following are some of the various ways that an instrument can be indorsed in the United States:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-23\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-86\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-183\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-specialindorsement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-81\" role=\"doc-glossref\">special indorsement</span> is an indorsement by a signature along with words indicating to whom the instrument should be paid.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-64\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-184\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-65\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-185\">Trevor MacEnroe was the holder of a check payable to him. He indorsed the check with his signature and the notation “payable to the order of the Magnitude Bank.” Thereafter, only the Magnitude Bank is entitled to negotiate the check.</p> </div> </div> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-24\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-87\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-186\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-blankindorsement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-82\" role=\"doc-glossref\">blank indorsement</span> is an indorsement by signature only, with no additional wording. When an instrument contains a blank indorsement, the instrument becomes bearer paper and any subsequent holder is entitled to negotiate it.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-66\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-187\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-188\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-189\">Sloane Miller was the holder of a check made payable to her. She indorsed the check by signing it with no other notations and later accidentally dropped the check while organizing her wallet. Because the check became bearer paper when Ms. Miller indorsed it, anyone who happens to find the check can negotiate it.</p> </div> </div> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-25\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-88\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-190\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-restrictiveindorsement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-83\" role=\"doc-glossref\">restrictive indorsement</span> is an indorsement by signature with instructions as to how the instrument can be used. Instruments may be indorsed with notations such as “for deposit only” or “payable to Magnitude Bank as trustee for the Justinian Trust.” Anyone who receives an instrument with a restrictive indorsement must apply the value represented by the instrument consistently with the indorsement. A party who does not apply the value as indorsed is guilty of the intentional tort of conversion.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-67\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-191\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-68\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-192\">A bank accepted a $50 check indorsed “for deposit only” and in exchange gave the bearer $50 in cash. The bank failed to apply the funds as instructed and, thus, converted the funds. The bank will be liable for any losses that result from its action. At minimum, it will have to deposit $50 into the appropriate account as instructed by the indorsement.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-69\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-11\">Holder in Due Course</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-193\">As noted earlier, when property is transferred, the transferee generally can receive only those ownership rights that the transferor had in the property. However, a holder in due course obtains special rights that a transferee does not generally receive, such as freedom from existing claims on the property. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-holderinduecourse\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-84\" role=\"doc-glossref\">holder in due course</span> is the holder of a negotiable instrument who (1) paid value for the instrument, (2) obtained it in good faith, and (3) obtained it without knowledge of defenses or claims against its payment.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-26\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-89\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-194\"><strong>Paying value.</strong> A holder may pay value in various ways. For example, she can take an instrument in payment of an outstanding debt or can exchange one instrument for another negotiable instrument. By contrast, someone who receives a negotiable instrument as a gift has not paid value for it and is not a holder in due course.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-90\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-195\"><strong>Good faith.</strong> A holder acts in good faith by observing reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-91\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-196\"><strong>Without notice.</strong> To qualify as a holder in due course, a person must not have notice that the instrument has been dishonored or that anyone has a claim against the maker of the instrument. Also, if an instrument shows any signs of forgery or contains any other irregularities that would call its authenticity into question, then the holder does not qualify as a holder in due course.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-197\">If all of the requirements to be a holder in due course are met, the holder obtains the instrument free of such defenses or claims against its payment. By offering particular rights to a holder in due course, the law encourages commerce.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-198\">If a transferee does not meet the requirements to be a holder in due course, the transferee is generally considered to be an assignee, and may be liable for any pre-existing claims upon the instrument in question. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-assignment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-85\" role=\"doc-glossref\">assignment</span> is the transfer of ownership rights in property from the property owner, known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-assignor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-86\" role=\"doc-glossref\">assignor</span>, to another party, known as the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-assignee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-87\" role=\"doc-glossref\">assignee</span>. Assignments usually are used to transfer ownership rights in intangible personal property, such as a life insurance policy as we discuss in Chapter 12. An assignee obtains only those rights in the property that the assignor had.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-70\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-199\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-71\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-200\">Manufacturer X and Retailer Y entered into a contract under which Manufacturer X agreed to supply goods to Retailer Y within six months of the contract date. Retailer Y agreed to pay for the goods in a lump sum when it received all of the goods. Manufacturer X then assigned the right to collect under the contract to Supplier A. When Supplier A delivered all of the goods, Retailer Y refused to pay for the goods because they were defective. As an <em>assignee</em>, Supplier A is subject to all claims and defenses that Retailer Y has against Manufacturer X and may not be able to require Retailer Y to pay the agreed-upon amount.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-201\">Using the same facts, assume that as part of the contract, Retailer Y gave Manufacturer X a negotiable promissory note guaranteeing payment for the goods when they were delivered to Retailer Y. Manufacturer X transferred the note to Supplier B, which became a <em>holder in due course</em>. Because Supplier B is a holder in due course, Retailer Y is obligated to pay the note and must pursue any claims it has against Manufacturer X in a separate action.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-72\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-12\">Liabilities of the Parties</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-202\">The maker of a negotiable instrument is contractually liable under the instrument. Anyone who signs a negotiable instrument becomes contractually liable to pay the instrument. A person’s liability, however, varies depending on the capacity in which she signed the instrument and on whether the instrument was a note or a draft. The following parties have primary liability to pay a negotiable instrument:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-27\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-92\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-203\">The maker of a <em>note</em> has primary liability to pay the note. Thus, if you sign a note, you have assumed primary liability to pay the note.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-93\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-204\">The acceptor of a <em>draft</em> has primary liability to pay the draft. A draft is accepted when the drawee signs it and thus agrees to pay it.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-73\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-205\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-74\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-206\">The holder of a check—a draft—presents it to the drawee bank for payment. If there are sufficient funds in the account on which the check was written, then the bank will accept the check, note its acceptance by signing the front of the check, and pay the stated amount to the holder. If the account does not have sufficient funds to pay the check, the bank will not accept the check. By accepting a check, the bank becomes liable to pay the stated amount.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-207\">Other parties who sign a negotiable instrument have secondary liability to pay it. The maker of a draft has secondary liability—after the drawee—for payment of the draft. If the drawee accepts the draft, then the maker’s liability is extinguished. However, if the drawee does not accept the draft, then the maker remains liable to pay the draft.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-75\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-208\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-76\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-209\">Casey Griffin wrote a check to pay a monthly bill, but she did not have sufficient funds in her bank account to cover the check. The drawee bank will refuse to accept the check, and Ms. Griffin will remain liable to pay the creditor the amount of the unpaid bill.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-210\">A person who indorses a negotiable instrument also has secondary liability to pay it. If the instrument is dishonored, then a person who indorsed the instrument is liable to pay the instrument according to its terms.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-77\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-211\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-78\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-212\">Rowan Edwards signed a note agreeing to pay a stated amount on a stated date and gave the note to a creditor. The creditor indorsed the note and transferred it to the Magnitude Bank, which held it until it came due. If Mr. Edwards does not pay the note when it comes due, then the creditor is secondarily liable because it indorsed the note.

However, people do not always detect a forged signature. If a person transfers a negotiable instrument without detecting such a forgery, does that person possess liability?</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-217\">Article 3 of the UCC contains rules for determining who has liability under a negotiable instrument in cases of forgery or other actions to wrongfully collect on a negotiable instrument. The UCC typically places the liability for such a loss on the party who was in the best position to prevent the loss. For example, a bank generally is liable if it accepts a check with a forged signature or indorsement. Banks are required to take reasonable precautions to verify signatures and are liable for the loss if they fail to take such precautions. The following are some exceptions to that general rule:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-28\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-101\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-218\">The maker of an instrument generally is liable when he makes the instrument payable to an imposter—that is, to someone who is posing as someone else. The maker is in the best position to prevent his own loss and thus bears the loss in such cases.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-92\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-219\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-93\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-220\">Leon Prigioni owed money to the Balance Company. An imposter posing as an employee of Balance convinced Leon that she was authorized to accept payment for Balance. If Leon made a check payable to the imposter, then he would be liable for the stated amount of the check.</p> </div> </div> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-29\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-102\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-221\">The maker of an instrument generally is liable when the instrument is made payable to a fictitious payee. The typical example of such a case occurs when a dishonest employee manages to get possession of a check drawn on the employer’s account and negotiates the check.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-94\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-222\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-95\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-223\">Lydia Bryan is an accountant for Redcliff Manufacturing Company and is authorized to sign Redcliff’s checks. Ms. Bryan drew a check payable to a regular customer, indorsed the check by forging the customer’s signature, and cashed the check. Redcliff is in the best position to protect itself against a dishonest employee, and, thus, it will be liable for the check.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-224\">The maker of a note or draft who fails to use proper care in writing or signing the instrument so that another person could alter the instrument is liable for any losses that result from the alteration. For example, assume that the maker writes a check for $1,000, but he wrote it so that the payer was able to alter it to read “One thousand five hundred” by adding “five hundred” after the “one thousand.” As a general rule, the maker will be liable for the $1,500 and can try to recover the $500 overpayment from the payee.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-225\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-91\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-226\">True/False: The sale of insurance policies is covered under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p> </div> <ol aria-labelledby=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-label\" class=\"choices\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ol-11\" role=\"radiogroup\"> <li aria-checked=\"false\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-i0\" role=\"radio\" tabindex=\"0\"> <label for=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-i0\">True</label> <div class=\"radio-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-96\"> <div class=\"check\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-97\">&#160;</div> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-92\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-93\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-94\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-95\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs-light.png\" /> </div> </li> <li aria-checked=\"false\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-i1\" role=\"radio\" tabindex=\"-1\"> <label for=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-i1\">False</label> <div class=\"radio-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-98\"> <div class=\"check\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-99\">&#160;</div> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-96\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-97\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs.png\" /> <img alt=\"correct\" class=\"answer-marker correct-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-98\" src=\"../../imgs/checkmark-xs-light.png\" /> <img alt=\"incorrect\" class=\"answer-marker incorrect-ib hide\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-99\" src=\"../../imgs/times-circle-xs-light.png\" /> </div> </li> </ol> <p class=\"reveal\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-227\"><span class=\"btn\" data-answer=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-key\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-97\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Submit</span> </p> </div> <div class=\"question-container-static visible\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-static\"> <p class=\"q-title-static\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-228\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-100\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <p class=\"q-stem-static\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-229\">True/False: The sale of insurance policies is covered under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p> <ol aria-labelledby=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-label\" class=\"choices-static\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ol-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-i0-static\">True</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-question-6-i1-static\">False</li> </ol> <p class=\"reveal-static\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-230\"><a class=\"btn-static\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/answer-key.xhtml#loma311-ch6-question-6-key\" id=\"loma311-ch6-a-20\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Check your answer</a> </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-7-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-7\"> <!--<p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-231\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch6-img-101\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p>--> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-7-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-232\">To be negotiable, an instrument must meet four basic requirements.

Most jurisdictions throughout the world have established legal rules to govern the operation of various types of credit transactions. Credit transactions can be either unsecured or secured.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-30\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-103\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-244\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-unsecuredtransaction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-107\" role=\"doc-glossref\">unsecured transaction</span> is a credit transaction in which a creditor extends credit and receives only the debtor’s promise to pay the debt. Should a debtor fail to repay an unsecured debt, the creditor must sue the debtor and obtain a judgment to recover the unpaid amount.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-104\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-245\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-securedtransaction\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-108\" role=\"doc-glossref\">secured transaction</span> is a credit transaction in which a creditor extends credit and receives a security interest in the debtor’s property as a way to guarantee that the creditor will be protected if the debtor defaults on the loan. For example, customers frequently purchase automobiles by means of a secured transaction in which the debtor agrees to repay the borrowed amount, plus interest. The creditor obtains a security interest in the purchased vehicle and can repossess the vehicle if the creditor fails to repay the loan. A creditor who obtains a security interest in a debtor’s property is referred to as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-securedparty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-109\" role=\"doc-glossref\">secured party</span>. A policy loan is an example of a secured transaction specific to the insurance industry.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-246\">The rules governing security interests vary depending on the type of property involved in the transaction. Security interests in real property are beyond the scope of this text; here we describe security interests in personal property. As a general rule, the laws of the state where the personal property is located govern the operation of security interest in that property. In the United States, Article 9 of the UCC governs security interest in personal property.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-114\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-13\">Perfecting a Security Interest</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-247\">In order to gain the full benefits and protections of a security interest, the secured party must comply with all requirements of the applicable state laws. Two basic requirements generally must be met to gain a security interest in personal property: (1) the interest must be attached to specific property and (2) the interest must be perfected.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-248\">The security interest must <em>attach</em> to specified property so that it is clear to anyone who is interested that the property is subject to a security interest. In order for a security interest to attach to specific property, the following requirements must be met:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch6-ul-31\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-105\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-249\">The parties must enter into a contractual agreement—known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-securityagreement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-110\" role=\"doc-glossref\">security agreement</span>—in which the debtor gives the creditor a security interest in specific property that is identifiable.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-106\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-250\">The debtor must have ownership rights in the attached property.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch6-li-107\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch6-p-251\">The creditor must give value to the debtor in exchange for the security interest. In other words, there must be a debt between the parties.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-252\"><em>Perfecting</em> an interest is a matter of taking additional steps to protect a security interest against claims from third parties. Requirements for perfecting an interest vary somewhat from state to state, and also vary depending on the type of property that is attached. The primary methods of perfecting a security interest are perfecting by (1) the filing of a financing statement, (2) taking possession of property, and (3) operation of law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-253\">Filing a financing statement is the most common method of perfecting a security interest. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-financingstatement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-111\" role=\"doc-glossref\">financing statement</span> is a document that is filed with a specified state or local government official to record the existence of a security interest in identified property of a debtor. In some states, the secretary of state is the administrative official who is responsible for handling such document filings. In many states, local governments are responsible for handling filings concerning personal property. The financing statement, which must be signed by the debtor, contains the names and addresses of the debtor and creditor and a description or other identification of the property that has been attached to secure the debt.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-254\">The states have established administrative systems to handle financing statements filings. The filings become part of the public record, and anyone can search the records to determine whether a given piece of property is subject to a security interest. Thus, these filings serve as notice to the public of property that is subject to a security interest.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-255\">A financing statement filing is valid for a specified period of time, typically five years. If a debt has not been repaid at the end of the specified period of time and the secured party wants to continue its security interest, the secured party can file a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-continuationstatement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-112\" role=\"doc-glossref\">continuation statement</span>, which amends the initial financing statement and continues the effectiveness of that financing statement for a specified number of years. The secured party can file additional continuation statements as necessary. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch6-gt-terminationstatement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch6-span-113\" role=\"doc-glossref\">termination statement</span>is filed when the debt is repaid and the creditor no longer has a security interest in the debtor’s property. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-256\">A secured party can perfect a security interest in certain types of property by taking possession of the property that serves as collateral for a debt. Typically, a secured party perfects a security interest in negotiable instruments and money by taking possession of the collateral property. A secured party also can take possession of goods and thereby perfect a security interest in the goods. In such cases, possession serves as notice to third parties of the security interest.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-257\">For certain limited types of collateral, a security interest is perfected by operation of law when the security interest attaches to the property. For example, when a consumer borrows money to purchase consumer goods and the creditor takes a security interest in those goods, the security interest is perfected automatically when the interest attaches to the goods.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-115\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch6-h3-14\">Rights of the Parties</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-258\">When a security interest has been perfected in identified property, both the debtor and the secured party have rights in the property. Typically, the debtor has the right to possess and use the property. If the debtor sells or otherwise disposes of the property, the creditor’s security interest nevertheless continues in the property. Thus, the creditor continues to have a perfected security interest and its rights are protected.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-116\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-259\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-117\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-260\">Luca Moraru obtained a secured loan from Gleaming Bank to purchase farm equipment. Gleaming Bank then perfected its security interest in the farm equipment. Before he repaid the loan, Mr. Moraru sold the equipment to a neighbor. Because Gleaming Bank had perfected its security interest in the equipment, the bank’s security interest in the equipment continues until Mr. Moraru repays the loan.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-261\">If a debtor defaults on the debt, then the secured party has the right to foreclose by taking possession of the property and disposing of it at a public or private sale. The proceeds from the sale of the property go to pay the expenses incurred in the foreclosure proceeding and to satisfy the debtor’s obligation to the creditor. If any proceeds remain, they may be used to pay other creditors that have a security interest in the property. When several creditors have a security interest in the same property, the order in which they perfected their security interests determines which of them has priority to receive the proceeds from the sale of the property. The first creditor to perfect a security interest has priority over all other creditors.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-118\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-262\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch6-div-119\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch6-p-263\">On January 10, the Fullbore Company obtained a loan from Precedent Bank and gave the bank a security interest in some of its machinery. Precedent perfected its security interest on January 20. On April 1, Fullbore borrowed money from Cygnet Bank and gave Cygnet a security interest in the same machinery. Cygnet Bank perfected its security interest on April 10. When Fullbore defaulted on both loans, it owed $5,000 to Precedent Bank and $2,500 to Cygnet Bank. Precedent Bank foreclosed on the machinery, which it sold for $6,000, and incurred costs of $200 in the foreclosure proceedings. Because Precedent Bank perfected its security interest first, it has priority over Cygnet Bank. Thus, Precedent Bank is entitled to recoup the $5,000 debt owed by Fullbore and the $200 foreclosure costs. The remaining $800 received from the machinery’s sale is payable to Cygnet Bank.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch6-question-9-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container

All powers not given to the federal government are left to the states. When Congress enacts a federal law within its power, the law preempts any conflicting state laws on the subject. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-preemption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-9\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Preemption</span> is a legal doctrine that holds that some matters are of such national importance that the federal laws override—or <em>preempt</em>—any conflicting state laws. The states cannot pass laws that are inconsistent with such federal laws.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-39\">One of the powers the Constitution gives to the federal government is the power to regulate <em>interstate </em>commerce, which is commerce <em>across state lines</em>. The states, on the other hand, have the power to regulate <em>intrastate</em> commerce, which is commerce <em>within a state</em>. Because insurers typically conduct business across state lines, the federal government has authority to regulate insurance activities.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-40\">The federal <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-mccarranfergusonact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-10\" role=\"doc-glossref\">McCarran-Ferguson Act</span>, however, gives the states primary authority to regulate insurance as long as Congress finds such state regulation to be adequate. According to the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the regulation of insurance by the states is in the public interest. But Congress retains the right to enact insurance legislation if it decides that state regulation is inadequate or not in the public interest.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-41\">Furthermore, although the states have primary authority to regulate insurance, a number of insurance products have features that also make them securities. Because securities are subject to federal regulation, these products are subject to both state and federal regulation.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

In the United States, the states divide authority for insurance as follows:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-34\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-43\"><strong>Legislative.</strong> The state <em>legislature</em> enacts and modifies statutes to regulate the activities of insurers. These statutes are found in the state insurance code, which is updated periodically.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-35\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-44\"><strong>Executive.</strong> The state <em>insurance department</em> adopts regulations that fill in the details of insurance statutes. The insurance department also enforces statutes and regulations and oversees the operations of all insurers that operate in the state. The state <em>attorney general</em> writes opinions that interpret state laws or regulations. The attorney general writes opinions upon the request of legislators, state officials, private persons, or businesses. Although <em>attorney general opinions</em> do not have the same force of law as statutes, regulations, or court decisions, state officials usually follow these opinions.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-36\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-45\"><strong>Judicial.</strong> The state <em>courts</em> generally have authority to interpret an insurance law’s meaning when application of the law to a specific situation is not clear.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-46\">See Figure 7.1 for an overview of state insurance regulation.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1103px;\" id=\"figure7-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-47\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-11\">Figure 7.1</span> State Insurance Regulation</p> <img alt=\"State Insurance Regulation\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-24\" src=\"../../imgs/7-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-9\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure7-1\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-12\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-10\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure7-1\" id=\"loma311-ch7-a-12\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 7-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-48\">State insurance laws can be divided into two main categories:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-37\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-49\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-solvencylaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-13\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Solvency laws</span> are enacted to make sure that insurers are financially able to meet their debts and pay policy benefits when they come due. Solvency laws affect an insurer’s capitalization, policy design, and policy reserves.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-38\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-50\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-marketconductlaws\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-14\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Market conduct laws</span> are enacted to make sure that insurers conduct business fairly and ethically. Market conduct laws set mandated benefits and regulate most of the nonfinancial operations of insurers, such as management, marketing and advertising, sales, underwriting, policyowner service, complaint handling, agent licensing, and claims.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-51\">To make sure that insurers are complying with solvency and market conduct laws, the states enact laws that require the state insurance department to periodically examine the condition and affairs of insurers that operate in the state. Insurance departments conduct two types of examinations: financial condition examinations and market conduct examinations.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-39\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-52\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-financialconditionexamination\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-15\" role=\"doc-glossref\">financial condition examination</span> is a formal investigation that is designed to identify and monitor threats to an insurer’s solvency. These examinations may be carried out by one or more state insurance departments. Statutes typically require an examination of each insurer within a specified period of time. State insurance departments also have authority to conduct more frequent examinations if needed. States conduct two types of financial condition examinations. A <em>full-scope examination</em> reports on an insurer’s financial position taken as a whole. A <em>limited-scope examination</em> focuses on one or more specific areas of an insurer’s finances, such as its reserves or its ability to pay claims. We discuss financial condition examinations in more detail later in this chapter.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-40\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-53\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-marketconductexamination\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-16\" role=\"doc-glossref\">market conduct examination</span> is a formal investigation of an insurer’s nonfinancial operations. A market conduct examination determines if the insurer’s operations comply with applicable laws and regulations. Like financial condition examinations, a market conduct examination may be carried out by one or more state insurance departments. We discuss market conduct laws and examinations in Chapter 8.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-54\">Typically, in addition to periodic examinations, state insurance laws and regulations focus on licensing requirements, reporting and filing requirements, and the right to take action.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-11\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-1\">Licensing Requirements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-55\">As we saw in Chapter 3, state insurance laws require <em>insurers</em> to obtain a license in each jurisdiction where they do business. Similarly, state insurance laws require <em>individuals who market and sell insurance</em> to obtain a license in each jurisdiction where they do business. We discuss insurance agent licensing in Chapter 8.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-12\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-2\">Reporting and Filing Requirements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-56\">Insurers must file a comprehensive financial report, known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-annualstatement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Annual Statement</span>, with the NAIC and all the state insurance departments with which they are licensed. We discuss the NAIC’s role in the regulation of insurance later in this chapter. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-57\">Insurers generally must file their Annual Statements by March 1 each year. The Annual Statement must reflect that the insurer has met all the financial requirements of the state insurance laws. Most states require companies to file shorter versions of these reports quarterly as well.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-58\">States also require insurers to file other types of reports and materials, such as insurance policy forms. Insurers typically create standard policy forms for each life and annuity product they sell. As a general rule, before issuing or delivering a policy form in a state, an insurer submits the form to the insurance department for approval. We discuss state filing requirements in more detail in Chapter 8.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-13\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-3\">Right to Take Action</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-59\">State insurance department actions may result from periodic examinations or complaints from the public. Insurance departments have the authority to take action when they find that an insurer is in financial difficulty or is not complying with regulatory requirements. Likewise, insurance departments have the authority to take action against insurance agents who fail to comply with state insurance laws.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-60\">Typically, an insurer found to be in violation of state insurance laws must pay a fine. In more serious cases, the insurance department may <em>suspend</em> or <em>revoke</em> the insurer’s certificate of authority.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-41\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-61\">If the insurance department <em>suspends</em> the insurer’s certificate of authority, the insurer must cease operating. The insurance department may impose a suspension for a stated period of time or until the insurer corrects the violation.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-42\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-62\">If the insurance department <em>revokes</em> the insurer’s certificate of authority, the certificate is no longer valid. The insurer cannot conduct business in the state until the insurance department issues a new certificate of authority.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-63\">A state insurance department, for instance, may suspend or revoke an insurance company’s certificate if the insurer is financially unsound or knowingly fails to comply with state laws, regulations, or an order issued by the department. An insurance department also may suspend or revoke the license of an insurance agent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-64\">The state insurance department may not take action against an insurer without an administrative hearing, unless the insurer consents to the action. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-administrativehearing\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">administrative hearing</span> is a proceeding held by an administrative agency—in this case, the insurance department—in accordance with the state’s administrative laws and procedures. An individual, known as an <em>administrative law judge</em>, conducts the hearing. The administrative law judge has the authority to hear testimony and decide questions of law and fact. The insurance department must give the insurer proper notice of the hearing.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-14\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-4\">National Association of Insurance Commissioners</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-65\">The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) is a nonprofit association of the insurance commissioners of all U.S. states and territories. The NAIC’s mission includes the following goals:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-43\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-66\">Promote competitive markets</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-44\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-67\">Facilitate the fair and equitable treatment of consumers</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-68\">Promote the reliability, solvency, and financial stability of insurers</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-69\">Support and improve state regulation of insurance</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-70\">The NAIC develops model insurance laws and regulations. States respond to model laws and regulations in one of the following ways: (1) they may adopt the model exactly as written, (2) they may use the model as the basis for developing legislation or regulation, or (3) they may ignore the model. However, for a state’s insurance department to maintain accreditation with the NAIC, the department must have adequate statutory and administrative authority to regulate an insurer’s corporate and financial affairs. This authority is established in part by the adoption of model solvency laws.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-71\">The NAIC provides a forum for state insurance department staff to discuss regulatory policy issues and develop national policy on certain issues. The NAIC assigns responsibility for studying such issues to membership committees. These committees receive information from many sources, such as legislators, insurance regulators, insurers, industry groups, and consumer groups. Committees then make recommendations to the NAIC Executive Committee. A recommendation may entail, for instance, adoption of a model law. A recommendation is adopted only if approved by the NAIC Executive Committee.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-72\">The NAIC also provides services for state insurance regulators. These services help the states coordinate their oversight activities and avoid duplication of effort and conflicting rules. The NAIC provides several computerized databases to insurance departments. These databases, for example, enable the departments to simplify the licensing process for insurance agents, screen insurers that apply for a certificate of authority, and exchange information about licensed insurers and insurance agents.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-73\">The NAIC <em>Examination Tracking System (ETS)</em> enables state insurance departments to schedule and coordinate on-site examinations of insurers. Also, the NAIC maintains a financial database containing information from insurers’ Annual Statements and assists state insurance departments in overseeing the solvency of insurers. We discuss these activities later in the chapter.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-15\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-5\">National Council of Insurance Legislators</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-74\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-nationalcouncilofinsurancelegislators\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">National Council of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL)</span> is an organization primarily made up of state legislators who are members of legislative insurance committees. NCOIL’s goals are to</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-75\">Educate legislators on insurance issues</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-76\">Improve the quality of state insurance regulation</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-77\">Make insurance more affordable</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-78\">Work to ensure that the role of insurance regulation stays with the states</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-79\">As part of its goal to ensure state regulation of insurance, NCOIL members testify before federal legislative committees and lobby federal legislators. NCOIL also develops proposals to help the states respond to federal congressional criticisms of state regulation.

id=\"loma311-ch7-p-100\">In each state, solvency laws apply to insurers that operate within the state. These laws impose requirements on an insurer’s reserves, assets, investments, capital, and surplus. If an insurer becomes financially unsound, regulators may monitor the insurer. Regulators also have the authority to take action to protect the public interest. The insight below provides additional information for our discussion of solvency requirements.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-34\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"The Balance Sheet\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-63\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-101\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-35\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-102\">The Balance Sheet</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-103\">An insurer’s <em>balance sheet</em> summarizes, as of a specified date, what the company owns (assets), what the company owes (liabilities), and the owners’ investment (owners’ equity).</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-37\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-51\"><em>Assets</em> are all things of value owned by the company. Examples of assets are cash and investments.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-52\"><em>Liabilities</em> are the company’s debts and future obligations. Most of an insurer’s liabilities consist of reserves, that is, the company’s need to pay policy benefits as they come due.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-53\"><em>Owners’ equity</em> is the difference between the company’s assets and liabilities. It represents the owners’ financial interest in the company. Owners’ equity consists of capital and surplus. Capital represents investments by owners, usually through the purchase of the company’s stock. Surplus represents the total net profits earned from a company’s operations and left to accumulate. Because mutual and fraternal insurers do not issue stock, they have a balance only in their surplus account; this balance is sometimes called <em>policyholder surplus</em>.</li> </ul> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-105\"><strong>Insurance Regulators</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-106\">From an insurance regulator’s point of view, a balance sheet addresses the question, “As of this date, how solvent is the insurer?” The relationship between the various components of a balance sheet are measures of a company’s solvency. For instance, a company with too little capital and surplus compared to its liabilities may come under regulatory supervision.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-38\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-1\">Reserves and Assets</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-107\">State insurance laws apply reserve requirements for life insurance and annuity policies. These laws for reserve requirements, which are based on the <em>NAIC Standard Valuation Law</em>, are fairly uniform across the United States. The laws impose minimum requirements on the size of policy reserves by establishing guidelines that insurers must apply to calculate their reserves.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-108\">State solvency requirements specify that an insurer must maintain assets that are at least equal to the amount of its policy reserve liabilities plus capital and surplus. Most insurers maintain reserves much larger than the minimum amount required by the states. Insurers acquire assets by investing the premiums they receive. They report the value of their assets on the Annual Statements they file with state regulators and the NAIC.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-109\">The states define which assets an insurer may include on its Annual Statement. The assets that an insurer may report as statutory assets are known as <em>admitted assets</em>. All other assets are known as <em>nonadmitted assets</em>. An insurer must report nonadmitted assets, such as furniture and fixtures, separately and may not use them to support its required reserves. The admitted assets held by U.S. life and health insurers primarily consist of corporate stocks and bonds, government securities, mortgages, and real estate.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-110\">Solvency laws also govern how insurers determine the value of their assets for statutory reporting. These valuation requirements make sure that all insurers use the same standards in the asset valuation process and that valuations are accurate.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-39\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-2\">Investments</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-111\">Each state has established safety guidelines for insurer investments by enacting one of two versions of an NAIC model law:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-54\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-112\">The NAIC<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-investmentsofinsurersmodelact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-28\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Investments of Insurers Model Act (Defined Limits Version)</span> specifies the types of assets that insurers are permitted to treat as admitted assets.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-55\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-113\">The NAIC<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-investmentsofinsurersmodelact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-29\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Investments of Insurers Model Act (Defined Standards Version)</span> provides a prudent person standard that establishes statutory guidelines insurers are to follow in making investment decisions. The <em>Defined Standards Version</em> does not specify quantitative limits on insurer investments.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-40\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-3\">Capital and Surplus</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-114\">The states set specific minimum dollar amounts of required capital and surplus that each insurer must maintain for the company as a whole. Similarly, the states set specific minimum dollar amounts for each product line. Because the requirements are stated as dollar amounts, the task of determining whether an insurer meets the requirements is relatively straightforward.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-115\">Most states also require insurers to meet <em>risk-based capital (RBC) ratio requirements</em>. These RBC ratio requirements enable regulators to evaluate the adequacy of an insurer’s capital compared to the riskiness of its operations. Thus, an insurer that exposes itself to more risk must maintain more capital and surplus than an insurer that exposes itself to less risk. RBC ratio requirements are part of the NAIC<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-riskbasedcapitalforinsurersmodelact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-30\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Risk-Based Capital (RBC) for Insurers Model Act</span>, which provides state regulators with information used to identify potentially impaired insurers.

This act requires large- and medium-size insurers, or their insurance holding companies, to conduct a self-evaluation at least annually. This process, known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-ownriskandsolvencyassessment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)</span>, is an insurer’s self-appraisal of its current and future risks, the adequacy of its risk management program, and its current and future solvency positions. Most insurers practice <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-enterpriseriskmanagement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">enterprise risk management (ERM)</span>, which is a system used to identify, quantify, and manage risks from potential threats and opportunities. ERM programs include formal reporting systems that insurers use to report the status of their risks to regulators and rating agencies.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-42\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-7\">Monitoring Solvency</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-121\">Annual Statement filings form the basis for much of the solvency oversight that the states and the NAIC provide. An Annual Statement, with supporting exhibits and schedules, shows the status of an insurer’s assets, liabilities, capital and surplus, revenues, and expenses. The focus in the Annual Statement is on insurer solvency. The state insurance departments have access to a database maintained by the NAIC that stores most of the financial information found in Annual Statement filings.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-43\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-5\">Financial Analysis</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-122\">State regulators, assisted by the NAIC, use tools to monitor the financial condition of insurers. For instance, state insurance departments refer to the NAIC’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-financialanalysishandbook\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-33\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Financial Analysis Handbook</span> to evaluate insurers and to identify insurers having financial problems as well as those that might develop problems in the future. The NAIC maintains separate handbooks for life, health, and property/casualty insurers.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-123\">The NAIC also applies 12 financial ratio tests, called <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-irisratios\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">IRIS ratios</span>, to the information reported in each insurer’s Annual Statement. IRIS is an acronym for <em>Insurance Regulatory Information System</em>. Figure 7.2 shows how the NAIC uses IRIS ratios to conduct a financial analysis.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1031px;\" id=\"figure7-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-124\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-35\">Figure 7.2</span> IRIS Ratios and Financial Analysis</p> <img alt=\"IRIS Ratios and Financial Analysis\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-64\" src=\"../../imgs/7-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-44\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure7-2\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-36\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-45\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure7-2\" id=\"loma311-ch7-a-16\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 7-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-46\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-6\">Financial Condition Examinations</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-125\">The <em>NAIC Model Law on Examinations</em> requires each insurer domiciled in the state to undergo a financial condition examination at least every five years. Many states require an examination at least every three years. The Model Law also gives the state insurance department the discretion to examine an insurer as needed. For instance, the insurance department may decide to conduct a financial condition examination if an insurer has unusual IRIS results.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-126\">The NAIC’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-financialconditionexaminershandbook\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Financial Condition Examiners Handbook</span> provides procedures for examining an insurer’s accounting records and financial statements. Financial condition examinations assess an insurer’s financial soundness in two broad matters. First, the examination determines if the insurer’s accounting records are accurate and if the insurer is operating on a lawful basis. Second, the examination determines whether the insurer’s financial and business profiles are free of solvency hazards.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-127\">The examiners write an examination report that indicates any adverse conditions they may have discovered. The report also identifies any significant changes in the insurer’s operations or financial condition since the last report.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-128\">The NAIC Model Law on Examinations requires that the report be filed with the state insurance department no later than 60 days after completion of the examination. The insurance department forwards a copy of the report to the insurer. The insurer has a specified time, not to exceed 30 days, in which to submit a written response. The insurance department reviews the insurer’s response and then enters an order. This order may set forth one of the following actions:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-60\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-129\"><em>Adopt the examination report</em> as initially filed or after making modifications</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-130\"><em>Call for a confidential hearing</em> to obtain additional information and then, within 20 days of the end of the hearing, the insurance department enters an order adopting the report as it was filed or with changes</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-62\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-131\"><em>Reject the examination report</em> and direct the examiners to reopen the examination to gain additional information; after gaining this information, the examiners prepare another report and file it with the insurance department for review</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-132\">If the adopted examination report indicates that the insurer is operating in violation of any state law or regulation, the department may order the insurer to take appropriate action to cure the violation. If the report indicates that the insurer is financially impaired, then the state insurance department will act to protect the insurer’s customers.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-133\">For financial examinations of some multistate insurers, the states work through the NAIC to administer <em>association examinations</em>. Each insurer is domiciled in one of four geographic zones. If an insurer operates in more than one zone or more than three states, the NAIC recommends that the insurer receive an association examination. Examiners representing states in the zones in which the insurer operates participate in the association examination.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-134\">Also, the NAIC provides guidance for financial examinations of insurance holding companies and other groups of companies under common control. The participating state insurance departments decide how the examinations of the various insurers will be coordinated and which insurance department—called the <em>Lead State</em>—will assume the leadership role for the overall examination. Among other things, the Lead State maintains a coordination plan, works with all the other states to implement the plan, and schedules all the examinations. In addition, the Lead State names an <em>Exam Facilitator</em> for each examination. Often, the Exam Facilitator is the Lead State, but depending on the circumstances, another participating state may be the Exam Facilitator. Typically, the Exam Facilitator’s chief examiner is the designated contact person for the examination.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-47\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-8\">Impairment or Insolvency</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-135\">The NAIC<em> RBC for Insurers Model Act</em> sets forth actions that state regulators should take when an insurer’s RBC ratio results fall below certain levels. Even if an insurer’s RBC ratio results do not dictate action, regulators have the authority to act based on their judgment that the insurer’s financial condition is hazardous.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-136\">Regulators are authorized to take a number of actions. For instance, a state insurance department might order an insurer to implement specified corrective measures or might place the insurer under the supervision of the department. In taking these actions, the regulator’s goal is to safeguard the interests of the insurer’s policyowners and other stakeholders.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-137\">If the state insurance department determines that the problems are severe, the department may ask a court to place the insurer in receivership. When an insurer is placed in <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-receivership\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-38\" role=\"doc-glossref\">receivership</span> (also known as <em>conservatorship</em>), the state takes control of and administers the insurer’s assets and liabilities. The insurance commissioner, or someone acting on the commissioner’s behalf, acts as the receiver. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-receiver\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-39\" role=\"doc-glossref\">receiver</span> (or <em>conservator</em>) is the person responsible for formulating a plan to conserve and control the insurer’s assets and for making sure that the insurer’s obligations to customers are met to the extent possible. An insurance receivership can have two possible outcomes:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-63\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-138\"><strong>Rehabilitation.</strong> Impaired insurers generally are first placed into rehabilitation. In a rehabilitation, the insurer continues to exist as a corporation while the insurance department assesses in more detail the insurer’s finances. If it appears that the financial condition of the insurer can be repaired, the insurance department may look for an investor to invest capital in the insurer. However, investors seldom are willing to participate in a rehabilitation.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-64\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-139\"><strong>Liquidation.</strong> If the insurer cannot be rehabilitated, the receiver places the insurer into liquidation. The receiver then can transfer all of the insurer’s business, including its reserve liabilities and assets, to other insurers. Alternatively, the receiver can sell the insurer’s assets and terminate the insurer’s business. In either case, the insurer ceases to exist.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-140\">Although an insurer does not exist after liquidation, regulators make every effort to continue coverage for customers. Regulators may arrange to transfer a liquidated insurer’s business to one or more other insurers or may continue coverage by some other means. The policyowners usually have the right to opt out of the arrangement. Generally, the policyowner may choose to continue coverage, subject to specified maximum amounts, and be credited with a specified percentage of the account value with a new carrier. Conversely, the policyowner may end the coverage and receive in cash a specified smaller percentage of the account value. The insight below provides more information about liquidation.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-48\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Liquidation and Guaranty Associations\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-65\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-141\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-49\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-142\">Liquidation and Guaranty Associations</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-143\">If no insurer takes over a liquidated insurer’s business, a state guaranty association generally provides a limited amount of substitute coverage. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-guarantyassociation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-40\" role=\"doc-glossref\">guaranty association</span> is an organization that operates to protect policyowners, insureds, beneficiaries, annuitants, payees, and assignees against losses that might result from a life or health insurer’s impairment or insolvency.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-144\">The guaranty association operates under the supervision of the <em>insurance commissioner</em>. Once regulators decide to liquidate an insurer, then at least one guaranty association becomes involved in the liquidation. If the value of a liquidated insurer’s assets is inadequate, the receiver can end all insurance coverage, sell the insurer’s assets, and issue the proceeds as fairly as possible.</p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-50\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-51\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-18\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-65\">The guaranty association determines the difference between the insurer’s assets and product-related liabilities, up to the limits in the guaranty association law.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-66\">The guaranty association then assesses the <em>other insurers</em> licensed in the state the amount needed to cover the failed insurer’s obligations to its customers. All insurers must participate in a state’s guaranty association to be licensed in a state.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-67\">An insurer’s share of the total assessment is based on its percentage share of the total premiums written in the state, subject to certain limitations.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-145\">State laws typically require insurers, at or prior to the time they deliver a policy, to give the policyowner a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-guarantyassociationdisclaimer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-41\" role=\"doc-glossref\">guaranty association disclaimer</span>, which is a document that informs the policyowner of the guaranty association. This disclaimer also states that, in the event of the insurer’s insolvency, the policyowner may not be totally protected by the guaranty association.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch7-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch7-question-6\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-146\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-66\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch7-question-6-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-147\">In each state, solvency laws apply to insurers that operate within the state.

The GLB Act is also known as the <em>Financial Services Modernization Act (FSMA)</em>. This law removed many regulatory barriers to affiliations between financial firms. However, affiliations must still comply with state laws governing holding company arrangements that include insurers.

The Dodd-Frank Act improves accountability and transparency in the financial services system and protects consumers from abusive practices. After the financial crisis of 2007–2010, this law was enacted to address the following solvency and market conduct issues:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-20\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-170\"><strong>Solvency.</strong> Some financial firms were so large and interconnected with other firms that their failure was deemed a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-systemicrisk\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-57\" role=\"doc-glossref\">systemic risk</span>, which is a risk that might affect a nation’s entire financial system.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-71\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-171\"><strong>Market conduct.</strong> Some financial services firms conducted business unfairly, unethically, and in ways that were not in the best interest of consumers.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-172\">The Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulatory system to address systemic risk.

The FSOC is a collaborative body chaired by the head of the Treasury Department. It consists of voting members and nonvoting members. FSOC members include federal financial regulators, state regulators, and an insurance expert.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-173\">The FSOC has the authority to identify <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-systemicallyimportantfinancialinstitutions\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-59\" role=\"doc-glossref\">systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)</span>, which are institutions—banks and nonbanks, including insurers—whose failure could pose a risk to the financial system. SIFIs are subject to more stringent regulatory standards than are other firms. These standards include stricter risk management, higher capital requirements, and additional regulatory examinations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-174\">The Dodd-Frank Act primarily targets banks. However, some of the act’s requirements apply to insurers. The act created administrative agencies charged with adopting rules and regulations to carry out the law’s requirements.

The main purpose of insurance is to protect against the risk of financial loss—whereas the main purpose of an investment is to provide financial gains. To encourage people to protect their families from the financial loss that can occur when a wage earner dies, federal tax laws generally do not treat death benefits as taxable income. However, when an insurance product has features that resemble an investment, federal income tax laws may treat the benefit as taxable income. When designing products, insurers consider how the product will be treated for federal income tax purposes.

A <em>security</em> is a certificate or electronic record that represents either (1) an ownership interest in a business or (2) an obligation of indebtedness owed by a business, government, or agency. Examples of securities include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, variable life insurance, and variable annuities. Consumers who buy securities may make a profit or incur a loss. These consumers take on a financial risk.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-91\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-13\">Insurance Products as Securities</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-213\">Insurers place the premiums they receive for life insurance and annuities in either a general account or a separate account.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-214\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-generalaccount\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-71\" role=\"doc-glossref\">general account</span> is an undivided asset account that an insurer maintains for the purpose of recording assets that back the reserves for <em>traditional</em> life insurance and <em>fixed</em> annuity products. Regardless of the investment performance of general account assets, the insurer pays the benefit amounts guaranteed by these products. Thus, the <em>insurer</em> takes on the financial risk. To ensure they have the funds on hand to pay the contractually guaranteed benefits, insurers invest their general account assets in relatively secure investments. These investments tend to have a lower rate of return than might be possible with more risky investments.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-215\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-separateaccount\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-72\" role=\"doc-glossref\">separate account</span> is an asset account, maintained by an insurer apart from its general account, in which premiums for <em>variable</em> life insurance and <em>variable</em> annuity products are held. The assets in a separate account may be divided among various investment funds or subaccounts. The owner of a variable product selects the subaccount(s) into which the insurer deposits the premiums. Variable products do not guarantee the exact amount of benefits payable, so the <em>policyowner </em>or<em> contract owner</em>, not the insurer, takes on the financial risk of the investments. In a variable life insurance contract the death benefit and cash value of the policy fluctuate according to the investment performance of the subaccount investments. Likewise, in a variable annuity contract the amount of the accumulated value and the amount of periodic annuity benefit payments fluctuate in accordance with the performance of the subaccount investments.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-92\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-14\">Regulatory Oversight of Securities</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-216\">Because consumers take on the investment risk when they buy an individual variable life insurance or annuity product, the U.S. federal government classifies these products as securities. Accordingly, variable products must comply with federal securities laws as well as state insurance laws.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-217\">Note, however, that some individual variable annuity contracts are used to fund group retirement plans. These contracts are exempt from federal securities laws, but they are subject to federal tax laws and employee benefits laws, such as ERISA. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-employeeretirementincomesecurityact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-73\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</span> is a U.S. federal law designed to ensure that employee pension and welfare benefit plans meet certain minimum requirements to protect covered employees. We discuss employee benefits plans in Chapter 9.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-218\">Many consumers use investment products to save for retirement. To encourage retirement saving, federal laws offer income tax advantages for some products. For instance, an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-individualretirementarrangement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-74\" role=\"doc-glossref\">individual retirement arrangement (IRA)</span> is a type of retirement plan that allows a person with taxable compensation to put a stated amount of compensation into a savings or investment product that meets requirements specified in the federal tax laws, and thus receive favorable federal tax treatment. The tax laws specify which taxpayers are eligible to contribute to an IRA and place maximum limits on the annual contributions a taxpayer may make to an IRA. There are two types of individual retirement arrangements:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-24\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-101\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-219\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-individualretirementaccount\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-75\" role=\"doc-glossref\">individual retirement account</span> is an individual retirement arrangement that takes the form of a trust or custodial account created by a <em>bank</em>, <em>investment company</em>, or <em>similar organization</em>.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-102\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-220\">An<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-individualretirementannuity\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-76\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> individual retirement annuity</span> is an individual retirement arrangement funded by an annuity contract issued by an <em>insurer</em>. In the United States, more than half of all the money invested in individual annuities is placed in individual retirement annuities.<span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-77\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch7-en1\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-78\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</span> </span></p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-221\">Federal securities laws provide a framework for regulatory oversight of the securities industry.

The SEC has authority to make rules and regulations that govern the purchase and sale of securities. This authority applies to sales that are made publicly through a stock exchange as well as over-the counter sales. A <em>stock exchange</em> is an organized marketplace where specific types of securities, such as bonds and certain types of stocks, are bought and sold by members of the exchange. Sales of stocks that are not traded on a stock exchange are referred to as <em>over-the-counter (OTC) sales</em>. For instance, SEC rules classify variable annuities as securities, and so the sale of a variable annuity is an over-the-counter sale of a security.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-227\">However, according to SEC rules, an annuity is <em>not</em> a security and is not subject to federal securities regulation if it meets the following conditions:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-26\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-107\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-228\">The insurer assumes the investment risk of the contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-108\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-229\">The contract is not marketed primarily as an investment.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-109\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-230\">The contract is issued by a corporation that is subject to supervision by a state agency or a state officer, such as the insurance commissioner.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-231\">SEC rules refer explicitly to annuities, but do not refer to life insurance. However, the SEC’s view is that variable life insurance is also a security. In general, all variable products offered by life insurers—including variable life, variable universal life, and variable annuities—are subject to securities regulation as well as state law. Most indexed annuities, on the other hand, currently are considered insurance products and are not subject to SEC regulation.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-93\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-15\">Registration Requirements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-232\">Federal securities laws apply registration requirements on individuals and firms that offer securities for sale to the public. These requirements apply to (1) investment companies, (2) individuals and firms that market securities, and (3) securities products.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-94\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-7\">Investment Companies</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-233\">Investment companies must register with the SEC before they conduct business. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-investmentcompany\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-80\" role=\"doc-glossref\">investment company</span> is a company that issues securities and engages primarily in investing and trading securities. The basic types of investment companies are</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-27\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-110\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-234\"><em>Open-end investment companies.</em> An open-end investment company is an investment company that establishes a portfolio of securities and issues shares in the portfolio to the public. The investment company will redeem shares upon the owner’s request. Such companies are considered open-end companies because their capitalization is not fixed and they normally issue more shares as people want them. Mutual funds are the primary type of open-end investment company.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-111\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-235\"><em>Closed-end investment companies.</em> A closed-end investment company is an investment company that issues a fixed number of shares to the public and does not redeem shares that are outstanding.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-112\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-236\"><em>Unit investment trusts.</em> The separate accounts of most life insurers are registered with the SEC as unit investment trusts. These unit investment trusts own and hold assets for the participants in variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. Each separate account may be divided into subaccounts. Each subaccount may invest in a different open-end investment company. The open-end investment companies in which the separate accounts are invested must be registered as investment companies.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-237\">The owners of variable life insurance and annuity contracts receive a prospectus for each investment company in which they invest. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-prospectus\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-81\" role=\"doc-glossref\">prospectus</span> is a communication, usually in writing, that offers a security for sale and that must contain detailed information about the issuer of the security and the security itself.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-95\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-8\">Individuals and Firms That Market Securities</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-238\">Registration requirements apply to individuals and firms that market securities. Sales of securities to the public must be conducted by a <em>securities broker</em> or a person who acts as an agent for a securities broker.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-239\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-securitiesbroker\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-82\" role=\"doc-glossref\">securities broker</span> is a person, corporation, or other legal entity engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for the accounts of others. Securities brokers often operate as both a securities broker and a securities dealer. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-securitiesdealer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-83\" role=\"doc-glossref\">securities dealer</span>is a person, corporation, or other legal entity that is engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account. The term <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-brokerdealer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-84\" role=\"doc-glossref\">broker-dealer</span> is often used to refer to individuals and firms that transact securities business.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-240\">Brokers and dealers must register with the SEC. They also must become members of the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-financialindustryregulatoryauthority\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-85\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</span>, which is a nonprofit organization of member firms and is responsible for regulating all securities firms doing business in the United States. FINRA is supervised by the SEC.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-241\">Any person who is associated with a FINRA member and who engages in the securities business must register with FINRA. This includes partners, officers, directors, branch managers, and salespeople. Generally, two levels of qualification and registration are available:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-28\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-113\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-242\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-registeredrepresentative\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-86\" role=\"doc-glossref\">registered representative</span> is a person who is associated with a FINRA member, engages in the securities business on behalf of the member by soliciting the sale of securities or by training securities salespeople, and has passed the applicable examination administered by FINRA.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-114\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-243\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-principal\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-87\" role=\"doc-glossref\">principal</span> is generally an officer and/or manager of a FINRA member and is involved in the day-to-day operation and supervision of the securities business, has qualified as a registered representative, and has passed additional examinations administered by FINRA.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-244\">We use the term <em>registered person</em> to refer to both registered representatives and principals. A person who solicits the sale of variable life insurance and/or variable annuities must be registered with FINRA and licensed by the state as an insurance agent.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-96\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-9\">Securities Products</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-245\">Federal securities laws require a security to be registered with the SEC before it is advertised or offered for sale to the public. Registration of a security does not indicate that the SEC has approved the security or made any judgment as to its merits. Federal laws set strict requirements for the sale of securities. Most such requirements are designed to ensure adequate disclosure to prospective purchasers of material information about the security.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-246\">Figure 7.3 highlights the registration requirements we discussed in this section.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1107px;\" id=\"figure7-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-247\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-88\">Figure 7.3</span> Securities Registration Requirements in the United States</p> <img alt=\"Securities Registration Requirements in the United States\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-122\" src=\"../../imgs/7-3figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-97\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure7-3\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-89\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span></div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-98\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure7-3\" id=\"loma311-ch7-a-22\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 7-3 Description</a></div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-99\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch7-h3-16\">Regulation of the Sale of Securities</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-248\">Registered members of FINRA must conduct business in compliance with all statutory requirements and the rules for FINRA members. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-finrarules\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-90\" role=\"doc-glossref\">FINRA Rules</span> impose requirements on how broker-dealers and registered persons must conduct business. Following are some examples:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch7-ul-29\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-115\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-249\"><strong>Broker-dealers must establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of the registered persons who work under their control.</strong> This system must reasonably ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. A principal must directly supervise the activities of each registered representative.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-116\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-250\"><strong>Advertisements, sales literature, and correspondence that broker-dealers and registered persons use to communicate with the public must meet certain requirements.</strong> For instance, sales materials must not contain promises of specific investment results. Before advertisements and sales materials are used, a principal must review them. The principal must initial or sign such materials to indicate approval. The broker-dealer must maintain a file and keep materials for at least three years after every use.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch7-li-117\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch7-p-251\"><strong>Broker-dealers must file certain public communication materials with FINRA for review.</strong> During the first year a broker-dealer is a FINRA member, the broker-dealer must submit all such materials to FINRA before use. After the first year, the broker-dealer must submit certain public communications to FINRA within 10 days of their first use.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-252\">FINRA also imposes requirements that apply to investment recommendations. At the time of this writing, FINRA required financial professionals to make recommendations that are suitable for the customer. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-suitability\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-91\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Suitability</span> is the principle that the sale of a financial product must be consistent with a customer’s investment objectives and financial situation. Note that the NAIC and some states also have established suitability requirements for variable life insurance and annuities. We discuss state suitability requirements in Chapter 8.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-253\">In addition, regulators at both the federal and state level are exploring expanded protections for consumers with regard to investment recommendations, and the regulatory landscape for investment advice continues to evolve, as described in the insight below.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-100\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Standards for Investment Advice\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-123\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-254\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-101\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-255\">Standards for Investment Advice</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-256\">The question of whether regulations provide adequate protection for investors has been debated for many years. Recently, the debate has intensified.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-257\">As we noted earlier in this chapter, one of the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act is to protect consumers from abusive financial practices. The Dodd-Frank Act provides the legal authority for the SEC to adopt a rule that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to act in the best interest of individual investors.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-258\">Initially, the SEC was unable to develop such a rule, and in 2016 the Department of Labor took action. The U.S.<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-departmentoflabor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-92\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Department of Labor (DOL)</span> is a federal administrative agency whose mission is to foster and promote the welfare of job seekers, workers, and retirees. The <em>DOL rule</em>, sometimes called the <em>DOL fiduciary rule</em>, imposed a higher standard of conduct than did SEC and FINRA suitability rules by requiring financial professionals to provide advice considered to be in the best interest of the customer in regard to retirement plans and accounts. The DOL fiduciary rule was struck down in a 2018 court ruling, but generated increased awareness of investment advice standards.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-259\">In response to this increased awareness, in 2019 the SEC voted to implement its Regulation Best Interest or Reg BI advice-standards package with an implementation deadline of June 30, 2020. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-regulationbestinterest\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-93\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Regulation Best Interest</span> seeks to enhance the quality and transparency of individual investors’ relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisers. Reg BI requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to act in the best interest of individual investors when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. It also requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a Customer Relationship Summary (CRS) to potential clients to disclose services offered, the nature of the relationship, fees and costs, and conflicts of interest. The goal of Reg BI is to enhance the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond suitability obligations and ensure that a financial professional does not put its financial interests ahead of the interests of a customer when making recommendations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-260\">At the time of this writing, several groups had challenged or were considering challenging Reg BI in the courts. Also, a number of other stakeholders—such as the DOL, the NAIC, and some states—were considering or had implemented alternate investment advice standards, some of which applied to variable life insurance and annuities.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-102\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-10\">Dispute Resolution</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-261\">Sometimes disputes arise between broker-dealers and customers. Similarly, disputes arise between broker-dealers and registered persons. FINRA rules require broker-dealers to submit to arbitration when they are involved in all such disputes.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-103\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch7-h4-11\">Compliance Inspections</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-262\">FINRA carries out its regulatory responsibilities by conducting periodic compliance inspections of all broker-dealers. The frequency of such inspections varies depending on the nature of the broker-dealer’s activities. Examiners review the broker-dealer’s records to ensure that all records are accurate and up-to-date. Examiners also review sales practices and the broker-dealer’s financial condition.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span></div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Each country has developed a method for defining which companies are considered insurers for regulatory purposes. Some form of supervision applies to all companies that fall within this definition. Typically, direct writing companies—that is, companies that underwrite and issue insurance policies—are subject to such regulation. Countries have established minimum criteria that insurers must meet. As a general rule, insurers and insurance agents must be licensed by or registered with a specific regulatory agency before they can conduct business. Figure 7.4 identifies the agencies responsible for insurance regulation in several countries.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1039px;\" id=\"figure7-4\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-264\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-94\">Figure 7.4</span> Insurance Regulatory Bodies</p> <img alt=\"Insurance Regulatory Bodies\" id=\"loma311-ch7-img-124\" src=\"../../imgs/7-4figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-104\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure7-4\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-95\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch7-div-105\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure7-4\" id=\"loma311-ch7-a-23\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 7-4 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-265\">Solvency regulation—often called <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch7-gt-prudentialregulation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch7-span-96\" role=\"doc-glossref\">prudential regulation</span>—is the primary focus in most countries. These countries impose minimum capital requirements as a prerequisite to obtaining a license to conduct insurance business. Regulators deny a license to any company that is financially unsound.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-266\">Regulators in most countries monitor and assess the solvency of all licensed insurers on an ongoing basis. Regulators require each life insurer to file periodic financial reports which are analyzed to assess the insurer’s solvency. Many countries require each life insurer to have an appointed actuary, who has specified qualifications and who is responsible for making sure that the insurer’s operations are financially sound. Most countries establish continuing minimum capital requirements. They also impose some type of restrictions on insurers’ investments.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-267\">As a general rule, when an insurer’s financial results fail to meet minimum requirements, regulators have the authority to intervene in the insurer’s operations. The actions that regulators may take vary by country. However, in those cases in which an insurer’s solvency cannot be restored, countries typically have procedures to liquidate the company. In all cases, the primary regulatory goal is to protect policyowner interests.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch7-p-268\">A number of countries have implemented reforms to address solvency concerns and the possibility of systemic risk.

In this discussion, a new product means any of the following:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-35\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-33\">A product that has yet to be offered by insurers in the jurisdiction</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-36\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-34\">A product that the insurer will offer in the jurisdiction for the first time even if a similar product is available from other insurers</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-37\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-35\">A product that the insurer currently offers in the jurisdiction but plans to change</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-36\">Typically, a product development team designs new products. Team members come from various areas in the company, such as actuarial, marketing, underwriting, claims, policyowner service, accounting, investments, and legal and compliance. The features of the new product are described in the policy. Although many activities make up an insurer’s product development process, our discussion focuses on the regulatory requirements that apply to policy development and filing.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-7\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-1\">Policy Form Development</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-37\">For each new insurance product, an insurer develops a policy form that meets the requirements of each jurisdiction where the policy will be offered. In the United States, nearly all of the states have laws that specify standard provisions that insurers must include in <em>individual life insurance</em> policies. Furthermore, insurers must include most of these provisions in</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-38\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-38\"><em>Annuity contracts</em>, although specific requirements for annuity contracts vary depending on the features of the annuity</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-39\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-39\"><em>Group policies</em>, although specific requirements for individual and group policies may vary</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-40\">The insight below shows typical required provisions; we take a closer look at these provisions in later chapters.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-8\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Required Policy Provisions\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch8-img-15\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-41\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-9\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-42\">Required Policy Provisions</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-43\"><strong>Provisions required in both individual and group policies</strong> </p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-10\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-11\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-40\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-entirecontractprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Entire contract provision</span>.

Describes how the insurer may adjust the policy benefit or premium if the application incorrectly stated the insured’s age or sex. Group life insurance policies have a misstatement of age provision, but seldom have a misstatement of sex provision because premium rates typically do not vary according to the sex of the insured.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-44\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-settlementoptionsprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-12\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Settlement options provision</span>.

Prohibited provisions generally are designed to prevent insurers from unfairly limiting the rights of policyowners and beneficiaries. Prohibited provisions vary by state.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-14\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-46\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-15\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-47\">Some states prohibit insurers from limiting the time in which a person may commence an action at law or in equity after the cause of action. For instance, the law might require a person to have no less than three years to commence such an action.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-48\">Some states prohibit the forfeiture of a policy for failure to repay a loan or failure to pay interest on a loan, except under specified conditions.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-49\">Many states prohibit insurers from backdating individual life insurance policies for a period of time more than six months. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-backdating\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Backdating</span> is a practice in which the insurer makes the policy’s effective date earlier than the date of the application. In this situation, the policyowner pays premiums for a period of time—before the effective date—when coverage was not provided. Insurers typically use backdating to lower the premium or to comply with a legal agreement, such as a divorce decree. However, to protect policyowners, the states limit the period of time during which premiums are payable when no coverage was provided.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-50\">Individual and group policy forms also must meet regulatory requirements for readability. These requirements are intended to make insurance policies easier to understand. Policies subject to these laws must achieve a specified score on a readability test approved by the state insurance department. An example of a readability test is the Flesch reading ease test.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-16\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-2\">Policy Form Filing</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-51\">A policy form usually must be filed with and approved by the insurance departments of the states in which the policy will be offered. Some states have <em>file and use</em> requirements, which require filing but do not require affirmative approval before the insurer may start using the form. Typically, members of the insurer’s legal or compliance area prepare a submission package that contains all required information for a policy form filing. If the product will be available in more than one state, the insurer modifies the policy form and filing package to comply with each state’s requirements. Figure 8.2 shows typical filing requirements.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1076px;\" id=\"figure8-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-52\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-19\">Figure 8.2</span> Filing Submissions</p> <img alt=\"Filing Submissions\" class=\"usesFloatingControlbar\" id=\"loma311-ch8-img-16\" src=\"../../imgs/8-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-17\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure8-2\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-20\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-18\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure8-2\" id=\"loma311-ch8-a-15\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 8-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-53\">Most states require insurers to file policy forms using the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-systemforelectronicrateandformfiling\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">System for Electronic Rate and Form Filing (SERFF)</span>, an electronic filing system maintained by the NAIC. Using SERFF, insurers can review each participating insurance department’s policy filing requirements. The SERFF filing process is private. Only the insurer and the applicable state insurance department have access to the electronic file during the filing process. Once a form is approved, however, <em>SERFF Filing Access (SFA) </em>allows interested parties to view filings that the states have made available to the public.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-54\">Most states have entered into the <em>Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Compact</em>. This compact was established by the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-interstateinsuranceproductregulationcommission\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-22\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Interstate Insurance Product Regulation Commission (IIPRC)</span>. The IIPRC is a multistate public entity that operates alongside the state insurance departments to:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-55\">Enable member states to develop uniform national product standards to protect consumers</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-56\">Provide a central point of filing for covered insurance products</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-57\">Review product filings and make regulatory decisions based on uniform national product standards</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-58\">Through the IIPRC, an insurer can make one filing for a policy form that will be used in multiple states, thus streamlining the filing and approval process. An insurer that operates in states that are IIPRC members may choose one of the following approaches:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-53\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-59\">Make one product filing with IIPRC. In this case, the IIPRC will apply its uniform product standards and review process. Insurers that file policy forms with the IIPRC do so using SERFF.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-54\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-60\">Make a separate filing in each state where the policy form will be used. In this case, each state applies its own product requirements and review process.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-61\">If an insurer operates in a state that has opted out of the IIPRC uniform product standards, the insurer must file policy forms directly with that state’s insurance department.

The goals of this model regulation are to (1) ensure that illustrations do not mislead consumers and (2) make illustrations easier for consumers to understand.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-74\">Insurance departments have broad powers to regulate any type of communication, whether or not it is listed in the state’s advertising regulations. For example, most states do not specifically address social media in advertising requirements. Yet insurance departments expect communications via social media to comply with advertising standards.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-75\">As a general rule, advertisements must be truthful and must not mislead or have the capacity to mislead. State insurance departments look at the overall impression an advertisement may reasonably create for a typical person in the target market. Such an impression is created not only by language but by graphics, format, and emphasis.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-76\">The Model Advertisements Regulation requires insurers to maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements. Some states require that insurers set up an advertisement tracking database. Also, the model regulation and some states require each insurer to include with its Annual Statement a certification that the advertisements used by or on behalf of the insurer comply with all applicable requirements. This certification must be signed by an authorized officer of the insurer.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Licensing requirements seek to ensure that insurance agents are (1) of good character and (2) knowledgeable about the products they sell.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-78\">A candidate for a license must pass a written test in each line of insurance he plans to sell. Most states consider annuities to be a type of life insurance. Thus, a license to sell life insurance usually includes annuities. In addition to obtaining a state insurance license, an insurance agent who plans to sell variable products must be a registered representative associated with a FINRA member.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-79\">The GLB Act, as we saw in Chapter 7, requires states to adopt uniform or reciprocal insurance agent licensing laws. The intent of this requirement is to simplify and streamline licensing from state to state. To meet the GLB uniform requirements, many states have established:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-59\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-80\">Standards that prospective insurance agents must meet before a license is issued</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-60\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-81\">Continuing education requirements for licensed insurance agents (generally required every two years)</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-82\">Ethics course requirements as part of continuing education requirements</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-62\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-83\">Criteria to ensure that the insurance product being sold is appropriate for the customer</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-84\">As an alternative to these uniform requirements, the GLB Act allows the states to enact reciprocity laws. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-reciprocity\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Reciprocity</span> is an agreement between two states under which each state gives residents of the other state certain privileges.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-27\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-85\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-28\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-86\">State A allows insurance agents who are licensed in State B to do business in State A. In the same way, State B allows insurance agents who are licensed in State A to do business in State B.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-87\">Most states have adopted uniform and/or reciprocal licensing laws. But because some states have not enacted such laws, a federal law was passed to remedy the situation. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-nationalassociationofregisteredagentsandbrokersreformactof2015\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers Reform Act of 2015 (NARAB II)</span> reestablished the National Association of Registered Agents and Brokers (NARAB), which was originally authorized by the GLB Act. NARAB serves as a national clearinghouse for licensing insurance agents so that they can sell insurance in more than one state.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-29\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-3\">Regulation of Sales Activities</h3> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-88\">A number of laws and regulations apply to sales activities of insurance agents and insurers. The primary goal of these laws and regulations is to protect consumers.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-30\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-1\">Unfair Trade Practices</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-89\">As we saw in Chapter 3, most states have enacted general unfair trade practices laws. In addition, as part of their insurance codes, most states have an <em>Unfair Trade Practices Act</em> that defines certain practices, including sales practices, as unfair. These insurance laws prohibit practices in the business of insurance if the practices are committed (1) flagrantly in conscious disregard of the act or (2) so frequently as to indicate a general business practice. The laws generally apply to all people and legal entities that engage in the business of insurance, including insurers and insurance agents. Prohibited activities include</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-63\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-90\">Defamation of any insurer</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-64\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-91\">False statements and false entries in books or records</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-65\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-92\">Unfair discrimination</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-66\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-93\"><span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-rebating\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-33\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Rebating</span>, which is a sales practice in which an insurance agent offers a prospect an inducement, such as all or part of the agent’s commission, to purchase a policy from the agent when the inducement is (1) not offered to all applicants in similar situations and (2) not stated in the policy</p> </li> </ul> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-94\">To ensure that consumers can trust the information they obtain from insurance agents, states have insurance laws that prohibit agents from misrepresenting any feature or aspect of an insurance policy. The following exercise shows some examples of misrepresentations that might be prohibited by states.</p> <div class=\"kInteractive widget widget521\" data-kotobee=\"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\" id=\"ki-wdgt-9313\" style=\"\"></div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-31\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-2\">Replacements</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-95\">Insurance agents sometimes advise clients to surrender a policy and replace it with another. The replacement may give a policyowner access to features not present in the current policy or may provide features that meet a policyowner’s changing needs. In some cases, however, a replacement may benefit the agent more than it benefits the client because the agent’s first-year commissions are higher than recurring commissions. Most states permit replacements, but impose requirements that agents and insurers must meet when a transaction involves the replacement of an inforce individual life insurance or annuity policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-96\">In many states, the Unfair Trade Practices Act governs replacements by prohibiting misrepresentations. Also, most states have specific regulations that apply to replacements. Typically, these regulations are based on the NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-lifeinsuranceandannuitiesreplacementmodelregulation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Life Insurance and Annuities Replacement Model Regulation (Model Replacement Regulation)</span>. The goal of the Model Replacement Regulation is to make sure that insurers and insurance agents provide consumers with fair and accurate information about policies so that consumers can make informed decisions.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-97\"><strong>Insurance Agents</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-98\">According to the Model Replacement Regulation, an insurance agent must submit a replacement statement along with every application for a policy intended to replace an in-force individual life insurance policy or annuity contract. The applicant and the agent must sign this statement. The statement indicates whether the policy applied for will replace an in-force policy. If the applicant has an in-force policy that is subject to the Model Replacement Regulation, then the agent has a number of other duties. One such duty is to give the applicant a written notice regarding replacement. This notice includes general information about the potential effect of a replacement. It advises the applicant to consider all the relevant facts before making a replacement. Both the applicant and the agent must sign this notice.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-99\"><strong>Insurers</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-100\">The Model Replacement Regulation also imposes requirements on insurers. For instance, when an insurer uses direct response solicitations in which no agent is involved, the insurer must ask an applicant whether he intends to replace an existing policy. If so, the insurer must provide the applicant with a notice regarding replacement and must make an effort to secure a copy of the notice signed by the applicant. Insurance companies that use insurance agents to sell insurance are required to oversee the activities of their agents and to ensure that agents submit required statements and notices.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-101\">When another insurance company’s policy will be replaced</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-18\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-67\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-102\">The replacing insurer is required by most states to send a written notice to the insurer that issued the policy that may be replaced. The replacing insurer must provide the original insurer with certain information about the policy for which the applicant applied.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-68\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-103\">The original insurer then must contact its policyowner to offer additional information about the existing policy. The original insurer has the opportunity to attempt to keep its existing business.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-32\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-3\">Suitability</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-104\">As we saw in Chapter 7, a number of FINRA rules apply to variable life insurance and variable annuities. In addition to these federal rules, the states also regulate suitability.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-105\">Most states have laws or regulations based on the NAIC<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-variablelifeinsurancemodelregulation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-35\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Variable Life Insurance Model Regulation</span>. This model regulation sets the qualifications an insurer must meet and the requirements variable life insurance policies must meet before the insurer can market these policies in the state. The regulation also requires the insurer to specify the standards of suitability it will follow when selling variable life insurance.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-106\">Many states have regulations based on the NAIC<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-suitabilityinannuitytransactionsmodelregulation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-36\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Suitability in Annuity Transactions Model Regulation</span>. This model regulation sets standards and procedures that apply to annuity recommendations to consumers. Before a consumer purchases or exchanges an annuity, the insurer or insurance agent must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the consumer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives, and any other relevant information to be used for making recommendations that are suitable for the consumer. In addition, an insurer must have a system to supervise recommendations to ensure that the insurance needs and financial objectives of consumers are met.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-33\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-4\">Sales to Seniors</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-107\">To comply with suitability laws, insurers and insurance agents must take into account the circumstances of senior consumers. For instance, features of some annuities, such as lengthy accumulation periods, are not appropriate for elderly customers.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-108\">In addition to general suitability requirements, many states have laws that address elder financial abuse. Some of these laws are based on a model law developed by the <em>North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)</em>. The NASAA model law requires financial professionals, including insurance agents who sell variable products, to report suspected senior financial exploitation to state authorities and to a third party previously identified by the senior. The model law also allows financial professionals to delay fund disbursements from seniors’ accounts. The law grants immunity from civil liability in such situations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-109\">Some states have enacted laws to provide added protections to seniors for annuity transactions. These laws may include one or more of the following:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-19\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-69\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-110\">Disclosure requirements at solicitation and on contract forms</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-111\">Limits on surrender charges for annuities sold to seniors</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-71\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-112\">Training for financial professionals to detect potential fraud, exploitation, and financial abuse of seniors</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-113\">In addition to state laws, U.S. federal law seeks to protect seniors from financial exploitation by encouraging financial services professionals to report suspected fraud. Federal law gives immunity from liability to those who, in good faith and with reasonable care, notify a regulatory or law-enforcement agency about possible financial exploitation of a senior. This immunity is provided to financial professionals (and the firms that employ them) who have received training to identify suspected exploitation of seniors.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-34\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-5\">Sales Violations</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-114\">When a licensed insurance agent violates a state’s regulatory requirements, the agent is subject to insurance department sanctions. In addition, when an insurance agent’s actions cause harm to a customer, the agent and the insurer for which the agent is acting may be liable to pay damages caused by the injury.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

Such activities are often regulated by the states. In this section, we look at the regulation of underwriting, claims, and complaint handling.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-35\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-4\">Underwriting Practices</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-116\">For the most part, insurers’ policies and procedures with regard to underwriting are free of regulatory constraints. However, to ensure that underwriting is fair and equitable, state insurance laws impose requirements to prevent insurers from unfairly discriminating against proposed insureds. These laws address factors such as race, national origin, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, and certain physical and mental impairments.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-36\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-117\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-37\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-118\">A few states prohibit insurers from charging different premium rates based on an <em>insured’s sex</em>. Most states, however permit different premium rates for men and women as long as the rates are based on sound actuarial principles.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-119\">Most states prohibit insurers from basing an underwriting decision solely on a proposed insured’s <em>sexual orientation</em>. Thus, the questions on a life insurance application should be designed to elicit medical and factual information relevant to the insurability of the proposed insured. Questions should not be designed solely to determine the proposed insured’s sexual orientation.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-120\">People who are victims of domestic abuse tend to have increased mortality risk. Even so, most states prohibit insurers from basing an underwriting decision <em>solely</em> on whether a proposed insured has been the victim of domestic abuse. However, underwriters may consider a proposed insured’s existing medical conditions, including those caused by domestic abuse. Such laws attempt to balance the right of insurers to evaluate a proposed insured’s risk against the public interest in protecting the financial security of abuse victims.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-121\">Increasingly, insurers are using predictive analytics in their underwriting processes. <em>Predictive analytics</em> is a technology that examines data to predict the likelihood of future outcomes. Insurers link to external databases to quickly obtain information that adds value to their underwriting decisions. The types of external information insurers consider include non-medical information, such as shopping habits, credit scores, home ownership, and level of education attained. In response to the increased use of predictive analytics, the NAIC and some state regulators have begun requesting applicable information from insurers. Among other things, regulators look at</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-20\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-72\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-122\">Data insurers use, where it comes from, and how it is used</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-73\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-123\">How the technology works</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-124\">How insurers notify applicants of the use of this data and technology</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-125\">Options available to applicants for contesting adverse underwriting decisions based on the data</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-126\">Procedures insurers use to protect the data</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-38\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-5\">Claim Practices</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-127\">Because insurance claims are based on contractual obligations, claim practices must adhere to general principles of contract law. Also, insurers must comply with state laws that apply specifically to insurance contracts and that regulate how insurers perform these obligations. In this section, we look at some of the regulatory requirements that apply to claims. In Chapter 14, we look at the claim procedures that insurers follow to meet their contractual obligations.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-39\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-6\">Unfair Claims Practices</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-128\">Most states have laws based on the NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-unfairclaimssettlementpracticesact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act</span>. This model law lists a number of actions that are unfair claims practices if committed by an insurer. To be considered an unfair claims practice the action must be committed (1) flagrantly and in conscious disregard of the law or (2) so frequently as to indicate a general business practice. Examples of unfair claims practices include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-21\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-129\">Refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation of those claims</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-130\">Failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after completion of the claims investigation</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-131\">Not attempting in good faith to settle claims promptly, fairly, and equitably when it is reasonably clear the insurer is liable to pay such claims</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-132\">The following exercise shows some other acts that might be considered unfair claims practices.&#160;</p> <div class=\"kInteractive widget widget139 kOver\" data-kotobee=\"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\" id=\"ki-wdgt-6423\" style=\"\"></div> <p class=\"txt-ni\">&#160;</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-133\">Laws based on the NAIC Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act require insurers to establish reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims. If an insurer engages in an unfair claims practice, the state insurance commissioner may order the insurer to cease and desist such practice. Also, the commissioner may impose fines on the insurer. If the insurer knew or reasonably should have known it had violated the law, the insurance commissioner may suspend or revoke the insurer’s license.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-134\">Almost half the states have adopted regulations based on the NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-unfairlifeaccidentandhealthclaimssettlementpracticesmodelregulation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-38\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Unfair Life, Accident and Health Claims Settlement Practices Model Regulation (Unfair Claims Settlement Model Regulation)</span>. This Model Regulation sets minimum standards that insurers must meet in handling life and health insurance claims. Among other things, the regulation requires insurers to keep their claim files in a form that is accessible for examination by state regulators. Claim files must contain detailed documentation of the insurer’s handling of each claim, so that regulators can reconstruct the insurer’s actions. </p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-40\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch8-h4-7\">Unclaimed Property</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-135\">If an insurer cannot find the person who is entitled to life insurance policy proceeds, those proceeds become subject to state unclaimed property laws. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-unclaimedproperty\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-39\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Unclaimed property</span> is intangible personal property that has gone unclaimed by its rightful owner for a specified time, typically three to five years. There are many types of unclaimed property, including insurance policy proceeds and annuity values. All states have unclaimed property laws, but the laws vary by state.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-136\">Generally, when an insurer cannot locate the beneficiary of policy proceeds, it handles the proceeds according to the state unclaimed property laws. Some states require that insurers periodically review the Social Security Administration’s <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-deathmasterfile\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-40\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Death Master File (DMF)</span>, which is a database of information about people whose deaths were reported to the Social Security Administration.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-137\">Also, to address the issue of unclaimed property, the NAIC offers a policy locator to the public. The NAIC’s <em>Life Insurance Policy Locator</em> helps consumers find life insurance policies and annuity contracts of deceased family members. When the NAIC receives a request from a consumer, it asks participating insurers to search their records to see if they have a policy in the name of the deceased. If there is such a policy, the insurer contacts the beneficiary or the authorized representative.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-41\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-6\">Complaint Handling</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-138\">State insurance laws regulate how insurers handle complaints they receive, either directly from customers or from the insurance department. Many states require the insurer to respond within a specified period of time—such as seven calendar days or 10 business days—from the date the insurer receives the complaint.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-139\">Complaints directed to the insurance department generally must be in writing. Figure 8.3 shows the typical process when a complaint is directed to the insurance department.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:708px;\" id=\"figure8-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-140\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-41\">Figure 8.3</span> Complaint Handling Process</p> <img alt=\"Complaint Handling Process\" class=\"usesFloatingControlbar\" id=\"loma311-ch8-img-35\" src=\"../../imgs/8-3figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-42\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure8-3\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-42\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-43\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure8-3\" id=\"loma311-ch8-a-17\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 8-3 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-141\">Many states have laws that specify the minimum information insurers must keep in their complaint records.

The Model Regulation describes minimum complaint record requirements and provides a sample record format. On at least an annual basis, an insurer must compile all of the complaints it received. The insurer may use this information to improve its practices and must provide the information to the insurance department when requested. The complaints must be classified by organizational function, line of insurance, reason for the complaint, how the complaint was handled, and state of origin of the complaint.</p> <div

Insurers develop and adhere to policies and procedures to safeguard information and to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-63\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-168\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-64\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-169\">Underwriters must know what information they can legally gather, share, and use to make underwriting decisions. Likewise, employees who review claim information must be aware of all applicable privacy regulations.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-65\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-7\">U.S. State Privacy Laws</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-170\">Many states have laws that establish guidelines for insurers to follow as they collect, use, and disclose personal information about consumers. These laws often are based on the NAIC<span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-insuranceinformationandprivacyprotectionmodelact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-54\" role=\"doc-glossref\"> Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Model Act (Model Privacy Act)</span>. The Model Privacy Act sets standards for transactions involving insurance for personal, family, or household needs. For purposes of the Model Privacy Act, an <em>insurance transaction</em> is one in which an insurer either services a policy or determines a person’s eligibility for insurance coverage or benefits. Laws based on the Model Privacy Act apply to (1) insurers, (2) insurance agents, and (3) insurance support organizations that collect information about individuals and provide that information to insurers and insurance agents.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-171\">Under certain circumstances, the Model Privacy Act requires an insurer to provide a consumer who has applied for insurance (or a policy renewal or reinstatement) with a written notice of the insurer’s information practices. This notice is required when the insurer (1) intends to collect information about the consumer and (2) will collect that information from sources <em>other than</em> public records or the consumer, such as from a medical professional or a consumer reporting agency. The Model Privacy Act also:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-22\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-80\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-172\">Limits the situations in which an insurer, insurance agent, or insurance support organization has the right to disclose personal or privileged information about consumers</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-81\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-173\">Gives individuals whose personal information has been collected in connection with an insurance transaction the right to (1) have access to that information and (2) have the insurer amend or delete incorrect information from its records</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-174\">In addition, the Model Privacy Act imposes requirements on insurers when they make adverse underwriting decisions. For purposes of the act, an adverse underwriting decision is (1) a declination of coverage, (2) a termination of coverage, or (3) an offer to insure at higher than standard premium rates. When an insurer makes an adverse underwriting decision, the insurer must provide the proposed insured, applicant, or policyowner with the reasons for the decision and a summary of the individual’s right to have access to personal information held by the insurer.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-66\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-8\">U.S. Federal Privacy Laws</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-175\">Federal law seeks to protect consumers’ financial privacy by limiting when financial firms, including insurers, may disclose a consumer's nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. A <em>nonaffiliated third party</em> is an entity that is not related by common ownership or control with the financial firm. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-nonpublicpersonalinformation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-55\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Nonpublic personal information</span> is personally identifiable information about a consumer that is not publicly available. Publicly available information generally may be shared without restriction. Information is publicly available if a financial firm reasonably believes the information is available to the general public from government records, widely distributed media, or disclosures required by law.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-176\">If a consumer can take steps to prevent information from being made publicly available, then a financial firm must determine whether the consumer has taken such steps. For example, if a consumer has an unlisted telephone number, then the number is not publicly available and is protected information. Thus, insurers must identify the nonpublic information they have about consumers and take steps to protect that information.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-177\">Financial firms must have policies and procedures for sharing information with nonaffiliated third parties. Subject to several important exceptions, before sharing nonpublic personal information about a consumer with certain nonaffiliated third parties, a financial firm must (1) notify the consumer of the firm’s privacy policies and (2) provide the consumer with an opportunity to opt out of information sharing with such third parties.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-178\">Furthermore, when a financial firm enters into a continuing customer relationship with a consumer, the firm must give the consumer a notice about its privacy policies. A continuing customer relationship is established, for example, when a consumer purchases an insurance policy from an insurer. In this case, the insurer must provide an initial privacy notice to the consumer when the relationship is established. The insurer also must provide an annual privacy notice for as long as the customer relationship continues.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-179\">Federal laws restrict how a financial firm shares information with nonaffiliated third parties. As a general rule, a financial firm is permitted to disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party (either directly or through an affiliate) only after the firm has taken the following steps:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-23\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-82\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-180\">Notified the consumer, in a clear and conspicuous manner, that the information may be disclosed to such a third party; this notice may be given via a paper document or electronically</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-83\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-181\">Given the consumer an opportunity to opt out of the disclosure by directing that the insurer not disclose the information</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-84\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-182\">Explained to the consumer how to opt out of the disclosure</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-183\">Note, however, that if the disclosure of nonpublic personal information is necessary to enable a nonaffiliated third party to perform services on behalf of the financial firm, then the firm is permitted to disclose such information to the third party <em>without giving customers an opportunity to opt out</em>. In such cases, the firm must (1) fully disclose to the customer that the information is going to be provided and (2) obtain a contractual commitment from the third party to maintain the confidentiality of the information.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-67\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-184\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-68\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-185\">An insurer plans to provide nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party to be used in marketing the insurer’s own products. In this case, because the third party is performing a service on behalf of the insurer, the insurer does not have to give customers an opportunity to opt out of sharing the information. However, the insurer must have a confidentiality agreement with the third party and must notify customers that this information will be provided.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-69\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-9\">International Privacy Laws</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-186\">In many countries, the laws that regulate how companies collect, use, and disclose personal information about individual consumers are not as strict as the U.S. requirements. For instance, some countries require companies to protect consumer information, but do not impose specific rules on how companies must fulfill that requirement.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-187\">Other countries have privacy requirements that are stricter than U.S. requirements. Perhaps the most stringent requirements are in the European Union (EU). The EU’s <em>Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications</em> seeks to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the privacy of personal information. The EU Directive requires providers of publicly available electronic communications services to take specific steps to safeguard the security of their services and ensure the privacy of electronically transmitted information.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-188\">The EU Directive established independent government data protection agencies and requires registration of databases with those agencies. In some cases, the Directive requires prior approval before personal data processing may begin.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-189\">Notably, the EU Directive prohibits the transfer of personal information from the EU to a non-EU country unless the non-EU country provides adequate protection of the information.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-190\">In 2018, the EU enacted the <em>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</em>. The GDPR further strengthened the protections provided by the EU Directive. Among other things, the GDPR</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-24\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-85\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-191\">Enhances the rights of individuals</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-86\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-192\">Expands the definitions of personal data</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-87\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-193\">Expands application of the EU Directive to include more non-EU firms</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-88\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-194\">Increases focus on cybersecurity</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-89\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-195\">Adds more stringent sanctions for violations</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-196\">In today’s global economy, such requirements affect companies around the world and may influence countries to adopt similar requirements for protecting personal data.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

These laws seek to facilitate transactions while protecting the rights, interests, and security of customers and businesses.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-70\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-10\">Electronic Signatures, Contracts, and Documents</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-198\">To be legally binding, some contracts traditionally require one or both parties to sign a specified paper document. Also, governments around the world have enacted laws that enable parties to effectively contract electronically, using electronic signatures and document records. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-electronicsignature\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-56\" role=\"doc-glossref\">electronic signature</span>, also called an <em>e-signature</em>, is a sound, symbol, or other data attached to an electronically transmitted document that was executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the document. Essentially, an electronic signature is whatever the parties to a transaction agree that it is. If the parties intend to be bound by the “signature,” then they can agree on the action that will create the signature.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-199\">In the United States, the federal <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-electronicsignaturesinglobalandnationalcommerceact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-57\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN)</span> eliminates legal barriers to the use of technology to form and sign contracts, collect and store documents, and send and receive notices and disclosures. E-SIGN applies to commercial, consumer, and business transactions that affect interstate or foreign commerce and to transactions that are regulated by both the federal and state governments. E-SIGN has the following legal effects when all of the parties to a transaction agree to use an electronic medium:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-25\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-90\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-200\">An electronic <em>signature</em> is the legal equivalent of a pen-and-ink signature.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-91\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-201\">An electronic <em>contract</em> is the legal equivalent of a contract written on paper.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-92\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-202\">Electronic<em> documents</em> are the legal equivalent of legally required written documents—known as records.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-203\">In addition to the federal E-SIGN, almost all states have laws based on the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-uniformelectronictransactionsact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-58\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA)</span>. The UETA is a model law adopted by the <em>National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL)</em> to provide for the effectiveness of electronic signatures.<span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-59\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch8-en1\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-60\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</span> </span>Specific provisions of the state laws vary greatly. If a provision of a state law based on the UETA is inconsistent with E-SIGN, then E-SIGN preempts that state law provision. To the extent a state law is not inconsistent with E-SIGN, then the state law is effective and is not preempted by E-SIGN. As a result, businesses still need to consider state laws in their approach to electronic signatures.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-204\">Under E-SIGN and the UETA, a consumer cannot be required to use electronic records, signatures, or contracts. Instead, the consumer must affirmatively consent to the use of electronic notices and records. Also, the consumer must receive a clear and conspicuous statement of (1) her right to receive paper records, (2) the consequences of later withdrawing consent to receive electronic records, and (3) the hardware and software requirements for access to and retention of electronic records.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-205\">Under the provisions of E-SIGN and the UETA, certain legal documents and transactions <em>cannot</em> be completed with electronic signatures. For instance, legal documents and transactions that require pen-and-ink signatures include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-26\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-93\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-206\">Notices of the cancellation of life or health insurance coverage</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-94\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-207\">Wills and testamentary trusts</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-95\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-208\">Court orders</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-96\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-209\">Mortgage foreclosures</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-210\">Laws in the United States are designed to make it clear that an electronic signature is valid. However, these laws do not directly address the reliability of such signatures. Reliability relates to how parties can authenticate that a person is who he purports to be.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-211\">Some countries have enacted laws that address the reliability and adequacy of electronic signatures. For example, the <em>UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures</em> sets criteria for the technical reliability of electronic signatures.<span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-61\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch8-en2\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-62\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</span> </span>Countries that have adopted laws based on the UNCITRAL Model Law include China, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-212\">The European Union (EU) has adopted the <em>Electronic Signatures Directive</em>. The directive sets up a system by which certification service providers that are regulated by the EU members must verify electronic signatures.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-71\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-11\">Cybersecurity</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-213\"><em>Cybersecurity</em> includes the methods used to (1) prevent theft, corruption, and unauthorized erasure of electronic data and (2) protect networks, computers, and programs from being compromised or shut down without authorization. A cyberattack can be catastrophic to an insurer. For instance, an insurer could experience business interruption, theft of customer and proprietary information, and significant expenses to repair damaged hardware, software, and data. Furthermore, a cyberattack could subject an insurer to lawsuits and reputation damage.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-214\">The NAIC has identified cybersecurity as a major concern for the insurance industry. The NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-insurancedatasecuritymodellaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-63\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Insurance Data Security Model Law</span> requires insurers and other entities licensed by state insurance departments to (1) develop, implement, and maintain an information security program; (2) investigate all cybersecurity events; and (3) notify the state insurance commissioner of such events. Also, the NAIC has taken the following actions:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-27\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-97\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-215\">Published 12 principles to provide guidance to regulators and insurers to (1) protect consumer information and (2) prevent and respond to data breaches</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-98\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-216\">Issued the NAIC <em>Roadmap for Cybersecurity Consumer Protections</em> (also known as the <em>Cybersecurity Bill of Rights</em>) so that consumers know what to expect from insurers with respect to (1) protecting consumer information and (2) preventing and responding to data breaches</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-99\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-217\">Updated the NAIC Financial Condition Examiners Handbook to include cybersecurity procedures; at the time of this writing, the NAIC also was considering updating the Market Regulation Handbook (described later in this chapter) to include cybersecurity procedures</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-218\">At the U.S. federal level, the SEC works with various stakeholders to monitor cybersecurity developments and respond to threats. For example, the SEC</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-28\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-100\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-219\">Issues <em>Investor Alerts</em> and <em>Investor Bulletins</em> to help investors protect themselves from cyber threats</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-101\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-220\">Provides cybersecurity guidance to broker-dealers, investment companies, exchanges, and other market participants to help them protect customers from cyber threats</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-102\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-221\">Has identified cybersecurity as a priority in its examinations of market participants</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-103\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-222\">Has established a Cyber Unit in its Division of Enforcement to focus on violations involving cybersecurity</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-223\">Investment companies and broker-dealers must adhere to SEC regulations that apply to information security. These regulations include (1) a requirement for written policies and procedures to protect customer information and (2) duties regarding identity theft. Investment companies and broker-dealers must be able to show compliance with SEC and FINRA cybersecurity requirements when they undergo an examination.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-224\">Globally, the EU’s GDPR provides strong cybersecurity protections for consumers. In addition, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors is considering cybersecurity standards for its member countries.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-72\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-12\">Regtech</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-225\">As we saw in Chapter 1, the technologies that help regulators and insurers manage regulation and compliance are called <em>regtech</em>. Like insurers, regulators rely on technology to reduce operating costs and improve productivity, accuracy, and the effectiveness of key activities. For example, some regulators now use data analytics to detect insurers and individuals who may be engaged in practices that violate laws. Also, some regulators use artificial intelligence to analyze regulatory filings. In addition, regulators monitor the use of technology by insurers. When regulators address the impact of technology on the insurance market, they often look to protect consumers by focusing on data security and market conduct practices. They examine activities such as data collection, pricing, underwriting, claims, and customer notification. The insight below describes how the NAIC is approaching this important issue.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-73\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Regtech in the Insurance Industry\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch8-img-80\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-226\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-74\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-227\">Regtech in the Insurance Industry</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-228\">The NAIC has developed a strategic plan to meet the technology challenges the insurance industry is facing. One goal of this plan is to provide state insurance regulators with the data, training, and tools they need to foster stable financial markets and reliable and affordable insurance products.

In today’s rapidly changing marketplace, this concern is greater than ever.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-233\">Insurance fraud is a crime in every state. Also, businesses and individuals who are victims of insurance fraud have the right to pursue a civil lawsuit against parties who commit fraudulent acts. The victims have the right to attempt to recover any financial losses that result from fraud.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-234\">Insurance fraud can be classified as internal or external. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-internalfraud\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-66\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Internal fraud</span> is fraud that is committed by an insurer’s employees, such as officers, directors, and insurance agents. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-externalfraud\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-67\" role=\"doc-glossref\">External fraud</span>is fraud committed by individuals who are not employed by the insurer, such as consumers, claimants, and individuals who have some type of business relationship with the insurer or who are in some way connected with an insurance transaction. </p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-77\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-235\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-78\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-236\"><strong>Internal Fraud:&#160;</strong>An underwriter approves a life insurance application for a friend, and the application does not meet the insurer’s underwriting guidelines.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-237\"><strong>External Fraud:&#160;</strong>A doctor, at the request of a life insurance applicant, knowingly fails to disclose a medical condition on an attending physician’s statement. <em>An attending physician’s statement (APS)</em> is a report completed by a physician who has treated or is currently treating a proposed insured.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-238\">The NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-insurancefraudpreventionmodelact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-68\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Insurance Fraud Prevention Model Act</span> is a model law designed to enable the state insurance departments to:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-30\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-106\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-239\">Investigate insurance fraud</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-107\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-240\">Stop fraudulent insurance acts</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-108\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-241\">Work with local, state, and federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies to enforce laws that prohibit insurance fraud</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-242\">Although only a few states have enacted the Insurance Fraud Prevention Model Act, almost all of the states have enacted statutes with similar provisions.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-243\">The Insurance Fraud Prevention Model Act requires insurers to include a fraud warning statement on all insurance applications and claim forms. Also, in almost all states, insurance professionals who have knowledge of a fraudulent insurance act are required to report this knowledge to the appropriate authorities. In this context, “knowledge” means that the person knows—or reasonably believes—that a fraudulent insurance act has been committed or that someone is planning to commit such an act. To encourage people to report suspected fraud, the laws in most states protect from civil liability anyone who in good faith makes such a report.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-244\">The Insurance Fraud Prevention Model Act also requires states to create an insurance fraud unit within an administrative agency of the state government. Most states have such a unit. The state insurance fraud units work with law enforcement agencies, insurers, and consumers to investigate insurance fraud. Fraud unit employees typically are authorized to investigate fraud, make arrests, and refer criminal cases to prosecuting authorities.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-245\">A number of states require each licensed insurer to develop and maintain an antifraud plan and to file it with the state insurance department.

As we have seen, these laws are designed to make sure that insurers conduct business fairly and in a way that protects the public interest. Regulators also periodically conduct market conduct examinations. A <em>market conduct examination</em> is a formal investigation of an insurer’s nonfinancial operations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-261\">In the past, U.S. state insurance departments routinely conducted comprehensive examinations of licensed insurers. A <em>comprehensive examination</em> is a full-scope market conduct examination by insurance department examiners to ensure that all nonfinancial aspects of an insurer’s operations comply with state insurance laws and regulations. Comprehensive examinations can be time-consuming and expensive for both the insurer and the insurance department.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-262\">Today, state insurance departments work through the NAIC to take a more streamlined approach to market conduct oversight. The NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-marketconductsurveillancemodellaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-75\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Market Conduct Surveillance Model Law</span> sets a framework for market conduct oversight of insurers by the state insurance departments.

Such analysis enables insurance departments to discover patterns or practices of insurers that deviate significantly from the norm or that pose a potential risk to consumers. Market analysis helps insurance departments narrow the scope of regulatory actions. Thus, the departments can focus resources on the problems most in need of regulatory attention.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-267\">Many state insurance departments follow the procedures shown in the NAIC <em>Market Regulation Handbook</em>.

On behalf of each participating state, the NAIC annually requests specific MCAS information. This information comes from licensed companies that wrote at least $50,000 in premiums for individual life insurance and/or individual annuities in the state in the reporting year. Companies enter the information into a web-based system maintained by the NAIC. Using MCAS information, state insurance departments can</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-33\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-115\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-272\">Measure and compare companies during the market analysis process</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-116\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-273\">Determine which companies’ data is unusual compared to industry norms and, thus, which companies may require regulatory actions up to and including market conduct examinations</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-274\">A state insurance department may allow an insurer to resolve any matters identified in a market analysis before the department takes further action. The Market Conduct Surveillance Model Law lists a range of actions an insurance department can take based on market analysis findings. These actions include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-34\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-117\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-275\">Writing to the insurer</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-118\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-276\">Interviewing the insurer</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-119\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-277\">Gathering information from sources external to the insurer</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-120\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-278\">Reviewing the insurer’s procedures</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-121\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-279\">Requiring written answers to interrogatories</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-122\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-280\">Conducting a desk, target, or comprehensive market conduct examination</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-95\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch8-h3-14\">Market Conduct Examinations</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-281\">According to the Market Conduct Surveillance Model Law, states will conduct comprehensive examinations only in unusual circumstances. Thus, target examinations are the norm. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-targetexamination\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-77\" role=\"doc-glossref\">target examination</span> is a limited-scope market conduct examination to ensure that the insurer’s operations comply with state insurance laws and regulations. A target examination may focus on (1) a specific line of business or (2) a specific business practice, such as an insurer’s replacement activities or advertising materials.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-282\">Examiners usually come to the insurer’s offices for the examination. But if the number of relevant records and files is limited, examiners may conduct the target examination from the state insurance department’s offices. A state insurance department examiner functions as the examiner-in-charge and oversees a team of examiners. Typically, the insurer names an employee to provide support to the examiners, as needed.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-283\">Insurers that operate in more than one state are subject to market conduct oversight by each of those states. Market conduct examinations and applicable market conduct laws and regulations are not as uniform as those for solvency examinations. Thus, multistate market conduct examinations are not coordinated to the same extent as multistate solvency examinations.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-284\">The Market Conduct Surveillance Model Law seeks to help states take reasonable steps to coordinate their market conduct actions and eliminate duplication of effort. Regulators can communicate and collaborate with each other by means of the NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch8-gt-marketactiontrackingsystem\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch8-span-78\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Market Action Tracking System (MATS)</span>. MATS is an electronic system maintained by the NAIC that allows states to schedule and coordinate market conduct examinations. It provides regulators with a method of sharing information on actions taken during the investigation of insurers.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-285\">Regulators use the Market Regulation Handbook to guide market conduct examinations. Examiners review a statistical sampling of a variety of documents to become familiar with the insurer’s operations. These documents include previous examination results, business records, and the company’s policies and procedures.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-286\">Some of the activities of an insurer that may be reviewed in a market conduct examination are:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch8-ul-35\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-123\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-287\">Advertising and sales</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-124\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-288\">Insurance agent licensing, appointments, and accounts</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-125\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-289\">Premium rating and underwriting</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-126\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-290\">Policyowner service</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-127\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-291\">Claims</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-128\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-292\">Complaint handling</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-129\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-293\">Technology, such as cybersecurity and use of data</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-130\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-294\">Company operations and management</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch8-li-131\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch8-p-295\">The insurer’s use of vendors and third-party administrators</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-296\">Insurance department examiners fill out an exception form for each problem they find. At the end of the examination, the examiner-in-charge summarizes the findings and writes an <em>examination report</em>. This report lists the problems found and recommends the steps the insurer should take to resolve the problems. The examiner-in-charge provides a copy of the report to the insurer and to the insurance department.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-297\">Typically, after delivery of the examination report, the market conduct examination process continues as shown in the insight below.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-96\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Further Market Conduct Examination Steps\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch8-img-110\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-298\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch8-div-97\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-299\">Further Market Conduct Examination Steps</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-300\">Often, the insurer has the opportunity to discuss the report with the insurance department and perhaps persuade the department to revise the report. Also, the insurer has the right to request a formal hearing with an officer authorized to hear testimony and make a decision about the final report.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-301\">The insurance department finalizes the report and places it on file. Often, the department makes the filed examination report available on its website. The department provides a copy of the report to the NAIC, which maintains the report in its information system.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-302\">Once the examination report is filed, the insurance department, if appropriate, issues an order to the insurer listing recommendations from the report. In some cases, the department specifies a date by which the insurer must provide evidence that it has complied.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-303\">If the examination report indicates a violation of state insurance law, the insurance department may sanction the insurer. Typically, penalties result when violations are due to the insurer’s general business practices or when the insurer knowingly violated laws. Most sanctions are fines; in some cases, the department may suspend or revoke the insurer’s certificate of authority.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-304\">After completion of the market conduct examination, many insurance departments conduct a follow-up examination, known as a <em>reexamination</em>. The purpose of the reexamination is to determine whether the insurer has complied with the recommendations or directives contained in a previous examination report.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch8-p-305\">Insurers are encouraged to create their own self-compliance programs and to report any compliance problems. States will often reduce the penalties when an insurer discovers a compliance problem on its own, reports it, and takes corrective action. Thus, companies that have controls and practices in place to detect and prevent illegal activities often receive a lesser fine than do companies that take fewer steps to monitor compliance.</p> <div

In this chapter, however, we discuss contract issues and regulations unique to group insurance. Although group and individual products are similar in many ways, they also have many differences. These differences have led most of the states to impose distinct regulatory requirements on group insurance. Also, some federal requirements apply to group products that do not apply to individual products.</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

The <em>group policyholder</em> is an employer or other party that purchases insurance coverage, according to the terms of the contract, for a number of people known as <em>group insureds</em>. The insureds have a defined relationship to the group policyholder. For instance, they may be employees of an employer, members of a union, or debtors who have borrowed money from a lender.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-27\">The contracting parties to a group life insurance contract are the group policyholder and the insurer. Although the insureds are not a party to the group life insurance contract, they do have legally enforceable rights under the contract. In the United States, most state laws do <em>not</em> require that insureds receive a copy of the group contract, but the laws do require that each insured receive a written description of the group life insurance plan. Every insured must receive a <em>certificate of coverage</em>, also called a <em>certificate of insurance</em>, which is a document that describes the insured’s coverage and outlines the insured’s rights under the group master contract. Some states also require that insureds have access to the group contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-28\">The group contract and certificate of insurance are integral parts of the contract. Sometimes information in the group contract conflicts with information in the certificate of insurance. Under the general rules of contract construction, ambiguities in an insurance contract are construed against the party that drafted the contract. Thus, when information in the group contract conflicts with information in the certificate of insurance, the disparity is considered an ambiguity and will be construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-5\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-1\">Formation of the Contract</h3> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-29\">A group life insurance contract is an informal contract that must meet the formation requirements for informal contracts described in Chapter 4. The parties to a group insurance contract must (1) mutually assent to the contract, (2) exchange legally adequate consideration, (3) have contractual capacity, and (4) meet the lawful purpose requirement. With the exception of the lawful purpose requirement, these requirements are met in the same manner for both group and individual life insurance contracts.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-30\">The lawful purpose requirement is met in a group life insurance contract when the group policyholder enters into the contract to provide benefits to covered group members. To enter into a valid group life insurance contract, the group policyholder must represent a group that is eligible for group insurance. For individual life insurance contracts, as we show in Chapter 10, the lawful purpose requirement is met by the presence of an insurable interest. However, an insurable interest usually is not required for a group contract because the group policyholder’s interest in the contract does not induce wagering contracts as does a policyowner’s interest in an individual life insurance contract. Typically, the group policyholder does not stand to gain from an insured’s loss.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-6\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-1\">Eligible Groups</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-31\">Group underwriters evaluate the purpose for a proposed group’s existence to make sure that the group was formed for purposes other than to obtain insurance. Such an evaluation is important because a group that was formed primarily to obtain insurance is likely to pose significant risk. In addition to looking at why the group was formed, underwriters look at the group’s characteristics, such as its stability, size, geographic location, nature of the business, age and sex of the group members, prior coverage, and claim experience. The goal of group life insurance underwriting is to cover a group of insureds who present similar underwriting risks and whose mortality experience is reasonably predictable. Rather than focus on the risk characteristics of individuals, group underwriters focus on the characteristics of the group as a whole.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-32\">Most states have enacted a law based on the NAIC <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-grouplifeinsurancedefinitionandgrouplifeinsurancestandardprovisionsmodelact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-6\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Group Life Insurance Definition and Group Life Insurance Standard Provisions Model Act (Group Life Insurance Model Act)</span>. This model act defines the types of groups that are eligible for group life insurance and specifies standard provisions that group life insurance contracts must include. Note, however, that specific regulatory requirements vary by state.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-33\">According to the Group Life Insurance Model Act, as well as most state insurance laws, insurers cannot deliver a group life insurance contract <em>unless</em> the contract insures one of several specified types of eligible groups. For each type of eligible group, the model act (1) identifies the party or parties that are permitted to be the group policyholder and (2) imposes requirements concerning the individuals who are eligible for coverage under the contract.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-34\">In some cases, a group contract may be issued by means of a trust. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-trust\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-7\" role=\"doc-glossref\">trust</span>is a fiduciary relationship created when one party, the <em>grantor</em>, transfers ownership of property to another party, the <em>trustee</em>, who holds legal title to the property for the benefit of another party, the <em>trust beneficiary</em>. The property is known as the <em>trust property</em> or <em>trust fund</em>. A written document, called a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-trustagreement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">trust agreement</span>, spells out the terms of a trust, including instructions as to how the trustee is to handle the trust property or trust fund. When insurance is issued to the trustees of a trust fund, the trustees own the contract and have a duty to manage the trust fund for the benefit of the insureds. In Chapter 12, we discuss the use of trusts in individual insurance. </p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-35\">The table below describes the types of groups that are typically eligible for group life insurance in the United States.</p> <table class=\"striped blue\" id=\"loma311-ch9-table-1\"> <tbody> <tr> <td id=\"loma311-ch9-td-1\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-36\"><strong>Single-employer group</strong> Employees of one employer</p> </td> <td id=\"loma311-ch9-td-2\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-37\">The policyholder is either the employer or the trustees of a trust fund created by the employer.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td id=\"loma311-ch9-td-3\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-38\"><strong>Labor union group</strong> </p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-39\">All members of a labor union or all of any class or classes of members of a labor union</p> </td> <td id=\"loma311-ch9-td-4\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-40\">Federal laws prohibit employers from paying funds directly to a labor union for any purpose.

Most states permit discretionary groups, but requirements vary by state.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-54\">As the chart above shows, one type of group that is eligible for group insurance is a debtor-creditor group. The insight below describes some of the unique features of life insurance issued to a debtor-creditor group.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-7\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Credit Life Insurance in the United States\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-14\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-55\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-8\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-56\">Credit Life Insurance in the United States</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-57\">Life insurance issued to a debtor-creditor group is referred to as <em>credit life insurance</em>. Although credit life insurance has many features of other group life insurance products, it also has some unique features. One such distinction is that credit insurance generally is not sold by traditional insurance agents but by lenders. As a first step in setting up a credit insurance arrangement, a lender enters into a contractual agreement with a credit insurer. Often, the lending institution and the insurer are affiliated corporations within a holding company system.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-58\">The contractual agreement between the lender and the insurer specifies the types of credit insurance coverage that will be available to the lender’s borrowers. When a person applies for a loan, the lender offers the borrower the opportunity to purchase credit insurance that will provide money to repay all or part of the debt if the borrower dies or becomes disabled before repaying the loan. As the borrower pays down the loan, the amount of life insurance decreases.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-59\">The regulatory requirements imposed on debtor-creditor group life insurance contracts differ considerably from the requirements imposed on other group life insurance contracts. Following are some examples of the types of regulatory requirements that are unique to credit life insurance:</p> <div class=\"figure\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-9\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-10\"> <ul id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-28\">State laws place maximum limits on the amount of credit life insurance that may be issued to a debtor. These limits are designed to ensure that a debtor’s coverage is generally equal to the total amount of the insured’s debt.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-29\">Laws in many states require insureds to be given at least a 30-day free look period and the right to cancel the coverage at any time.</li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-30\">State laws require that specified information be disclosed to debtors before they elect to purchase credit insurance. For example, the lender must disclose that it cannot require the debtor to purchase credit insurance as a condition of obtaining approval of the loan.</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-60\">The single employer group is the most common type of group to which group insurance contracts are issued. A contract that is issued to a single employer group insures employees of one employer for the benefit of persons other than the employer. The individuals eligible for coverage under a single employer group contract can be (1) all employees or (2) all employees of any designated class or classes of employees.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-61\">The Group Life Insurance Model Act permits a group contract to define the term “employees” to include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-31\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-62\">Employees of subsidiary corporations</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-32\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-63\">Employees of affiliated corporations, proprietorships, and partnerships that are under common control</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-33\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-64\">Retired employees, former employees, and directors of a corporate employer</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-65\">The Group Life Insurance Model Act does not place minimum requirements on the size of eligible single employer groups. The NAIC leaves this decision up to each state. Most states require that a single employer group life insurance contract insure at least a specified minimum number of group members. Depending on the state, employer-employee group life insurance contracts must insure from at least two to at least 10 group members.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-11\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-2\">Regulatory Jurisdiction</h4> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-66\">Before issuing a group contract to an eligible group, an insurer must determine the <em>regulatory jurisdiction</em>, also known as the <em>situs</em>, for the contract. The regulatory jurisdiction determines the applicable state insurance requirements. The parties to a group contract can decide where the insurer will deliver the contract to the group policyholder for purposes of establishing regulatory jurisdiction. State laws, however, require that the parties select a place that has a reasonable basis for delivery of the contract. Video 9.1 shows the criteria states use to determine regulatory jurisdiction.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video9-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-67\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-9\">Video 9.1</span> Determining Regulatory Jurisdiction for a Group Contract</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-12\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-13\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-68\">Determining Regulatory Jurisdiction for a Group Contract</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/9-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

However, because State B has an extraterritorial law, that law also applies to employees who live in State B. The extraterritorial law does <em>not</em> apply to employees who live in States A and C.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-27\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-3\">Effective Date of the Contract</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-73\">A <em>group life insurance contract</em> becomes effective on the date mutually agreed upon by the insurer and the group policyholder. The agreed-on date serves as the effective date even if the group policyholder pays the initial premium on a different date.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-74\">The effective date of each <em>insured’s coverage</em> is determined by a number of provisions found in the group contract and certificate of coverage, as described later in this chapter.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-28\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-4\">Premiums and Participation Requirements</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-75\">The group policyholder is responsible for remitting premiums to the insurer, usually on a monthly basis. Typically, premiums are due prior to the period of coverage. Whether insureds must pay all or part of the cost of these premiums depends on if the plan is contributory or noncontributory.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-76\">Under a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-contributoryplan\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">contributory plan</span>, the insureds pay all or part of the premiums for their coverage. When a plan is contributory, eligible group members must be given the choice of whether to participate, and they must authorize the payment of their premium contributions, typically as a payroll deduction. Insurers commonly require group policyholders to pay at least part of the premiums for group life insurance. Such a requirement, which is imposed by law in many states, helps to reduce the insureds’ insurance costs, and thus tends to increase participation in the plan.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-77\">For contributory plans, group insurers often have a <em>minimum participation requirement</em> to guard against antiselection, which is the tendency for people who are most likely to have claims to be the people most likely to apply for insurance. Insurers usually require that at least 75 percent of eligible group members participate in a contributory plan.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-78\">Under a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-noncontributoryplan\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">noncontributory plan</span>, the group policyholder pays the entire cost of the premium for the coverage. If a plan is noncontributory, state insurance laws usually require all eligible group members to be covered under the plan unless they reject the coverage in writing.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-29\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-5\">Required Group Contract Provisions</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-79\">The Group Life Insurance Model Act and most state insurance laws require that certain provisions, such as those shown below, be included in group life insurance contracts delivered or issued for delivery within the state. Each of the following provisions, except for the evidence of insurability provision, are similar to those that must be included in individual life insurance policies. Individual life insurance policies do not contain an evidence of insurability provision.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-41\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-80\">A <em>grace period provision</em> gives the group policyholder a grace period of 31 days for the payment of renewal premiums. The insurer can terminate a group life insurance contract for nonpayment of premium at the end of any grace period.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-42\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-81\">An <em>incontestability provision</em> states that after the group insurance contract has been in force for two years, the insurer may not avoid the contract on the grounds of a material misrepresentation in the application. Insurers rarely contest a group life insurance contract because of material misrepresentation by the <em>group policyholder</em>. The incontestability provision also limits the insurer’s ability to contest the validity of an <em>insured’s coverage</em> after that coverage has been in force for two years during the insured’s lifetime.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-43\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-82\">An <em>entire contract provision</em> defines the documents that constitute the contract. It states that a copy of the application shall be attached to the contract when issued and that all statements made by the group policyholder or the insureds shall be deemed representations and not warranties. An entire contract provision also says that no statement made by an insured shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the document containing the statement has been provided to the insured. If the insured is deceased or incapacitated, then a copy of the document containing the statement must be provided to the insured’s beneficiary or personal representative. The entire contract provision ensures that the insured (or the insured’s beneficiary or representative) receives every document that may affect his rights or benefits under the contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-44\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-83\">A <em>misstatement of age provision</em> specifies an equitable adjustment of premiums, benefits, or both premiums and benefits if the age of an insured is misstated. The provision must clearly state the method the insurer will use to make such an adjustment. Unlike individual life insurance policies, group life insurance contracts do not include a misstatement of sex provision; this is because group insurance premiums typically do not vary according to the sex of the insured.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-84\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-evidenceofinsurabilityprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">evidence of insurability provision</span> specifies the conditions, if any, under which the insurer reserves the right to require a person eligible for insurance to provide evidence of insurability satisfactory to the insurer in order to obtain part or all of her coverage. We discuss some of these conditions later in the chapter. When an insured is required to provide evidence of insurability, that evidence generally is documented in a questionnaire included in or attached to the group member’s enrollment form (described below). If an insured makes material misrepresentations of fact in providing evidence of insurability, the insurer has the right to contest the insured’s coverage during the contestable period shown in the contract and certificate of insurance. Note that a material misrepresentation by an insured does not affect the validity of the group contract; it affects only the validity of the coverage on the particular insured.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-30\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-2\">Plan Enrollment</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-85\">The group policyholder usually handles some of the group plan’s administrative activities. For example, the group policyholder typically is responsible for enrolling new group members in the plan.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-86\">Group members usually are required to complete an enrollment form to obtain group life insurance coverage. The enrollment form serves several purposes, including allowing the group member to</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-87\">Elect coverage</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-88\">Make beneficiary designations</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-89\">Enroll for dependent coverage, if included in the contract</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-90\">The enrollment form provides the insurer with identifying information about the insureds who are enrolled under the plan. In contributory plans, enrollment forms contain the group members’ written authorization for the employer to make payroll deductions to pay the employees’ share of the premium.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-91\">Each group insurance contract describes which members of the group are eligible to be covered under the contract. For instance, group contracts that cover an employer-employee group typically define <em>eligible employees</em> as all employees or those employees in a specified class or classes. State laws require that these classes be defined by conditions pertaining to employment, such as salaried and hourly employees, exempt and nonexempt employees, or employees who work at specified locations. Most contracts indicate that an employee must work full-time in order to be eligible for coverage and that employees who work less than a specified number of hours per week are excluded from eligibility.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-92\">A group life insurance contract subject to the Group Life Insurance Model Act may provide coverage on the lives of the insured’s spouse and dependent children, if evidence of insurability is provided. Note, however, that evidence of insurability cannot be required for a newborn. Under the Group Life Insurance Model Act, the amount of dependent life insurance coverage, payable to the insured, may not exceed 50 percent of the amount of insurance on the life of the insured.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-93\">Most employer-employee group contracts include requirements that employees must meet before they can be covered. For example, the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-activelyatworkprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-20\" role=\"doc-glossref\">actively-at-work provision</span> states that an employee must be actively at work—not away from work due to sickness, injury, or leave—on the day coverage begins. If the employee is not actively at work on the day coverage would otherwise become effective, the employee is not covered by the group contract unless and until he returns to work. Insurance for individuals covered under employer-employee group contracts is generally less expensive than insurance under individual policies in part because employed persons tend to be healthier. The actively-at-work provision helps insurers more effectively manage risk by ensuring that the employee is able to work and is actually working on the day coverage begins.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-94\">Another common contract provision that affects eligibility is the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-probationaryperiodprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">probationary period provision</span>, also called the <em>waiting period</em>, which specifies the length of time that a new employee must wait before he can be covered under a group insurance plan. Some plans have no probationary period. The probationary period is followed by an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-enrollmentperiod\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-22\" role=\"doc-glossref\">enrollment period</span>, also known as an <em>eligibility period</em>, which is a period of time, usually 31 days, during which a new employee may enroll for group life insurance coverage. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-95\">An eligible group member who decides to enroll in the plan after the enrollment period ends is considered a <em>late entrant</em>. A late entrant generally must provide satisfactory evidence of insurability to enroll for group insurance coverage. However, evidence of insurability is not required when the group member enrolls during an open-enrollment period. An <em>open-enrollment period</em> is a specified period of time, which typically occurs annually, during which group members may enroll for coverage or change existing coverage without providing evidence of insurability. In addition, a group member may enroll for coverage or change existing coverage without providing evidence of insurability during a <em>special enrollment period</em>, which occurs at the time of a specified life event, such as marriage or the birth of a child.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-96\">Watch Video 9.2 for an example of how an insured’s enrollment works.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video9-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-97\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-23\">Video 9.2</span> How a Group Insured’s Enrollment Works</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-31\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-32\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-98\">How a Group Insured’s Enrollment Works</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/9-2video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

The insured may name as the beneficiary an individual, the insured’s estate, a corporation, a charitable organization, or any other entity. Because most employer plans are subject to ERISA, which requires that plan assets be used for the benefit of the plan participants, an insured generally cannot name the group policyholder as the beneficiary. However, in some cases, such as for a debtor-creditor group or corporate-owned life insurance, the group policyholder is the beneficiary.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-56\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-113\">When a contract is issued to a creditor to insure the lives of its debtors, the creditor is both the group policyholder and the beneficiary, and the death benefit is used to reduce or extinguish the insured’s unpaid indebtedness to the creditor.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-57\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-114\">In the case of <em>corporate-owned life insurance</em>, also known as <em>COLI</em>, the employer owns, pays the premiums for, and is the beneficiary of life insurance on one or more employees. COLI can be used for various reasons. For instance, an employer may insure the lives of key employees as a way to help offset the cost of finding and training a replacement for a person who is essential to the company’s success. This type of insurance is called <em>key person life insurance</em>. COLI can also be used to help fund employee benefits, such as retiree health insurance. In this case, the employer insures a large number of employees and uses the cash value and death benefits to pay for employee benefits. If the life insurance is purchased by a trust, the insurance is called <em>trust-owned life insurance</em> or <em>TOLI</em>.</p> </li> </ul> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-115\">Most group life insurance contracts give the insured the right to change the beneficiary. When a new beneficiary is named, the prior beneficiary’s right to receive the proceeds payable under the contract is revoked. A beneficiary designation is revocable if the insured has the unrestricted right to change the designation; such a beneficiary is known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-revocablebeneficiary\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">revocable beneficiary</span> <em>.</em> A revocable beneficiary generally has no legal interest in the proceeds of a contract nor any involvement with the contract until after the death of the insured. During the insured’s lifetime, a revocable beneficiary cannot prevent an insured from exercising ownership rights. We discuss beneficiaries in more detail in Chapter 11. </p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-56\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-4\">Termination Provisions</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-116\">Under most group life insurance contracts, an insured’s coverage ends when the group contract ends. An insured’s coverage also can end while the group contract remains in force.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-57\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-6\">Termination of the Group Contract</h4> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-117\">Typically, both the group policyholder and the insurer have the right to terminate the group contract. According to the terms of most group life insurance contracts, the <em>group policyholder</em> can exercise its right to terminate the contract by giving the insurer written notice of termination at least a specified number of days prior to the termination date. The notice usually must be given at least 31 days prior to termination.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-118\">Under certain conditions, the <em>insurer</em> can terminate a group life insurance contract. For example, as we saw earlier, group insurers often establish minimum participation requirements to guard against antiselection. Group contracts usually state that at least 75 percent of eligible group members must participate in a contributory plan. If a group’s participation level falls below the required minimum, the insurer has the right to terminate the group contract on a premium due date. In such situations, the insurer must give the group policyholder written notice of termination, which usually must come 31 days prior to the date of termination.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-119\">An insurer may terminate a group life insurance contract for nonpayment of premium at the end of any grace period. The coverage provided by a group life insurance contract remains in effect during the grace period, unless the group policyholder has notified the insurer that it has elected to discontinue coverage in accordance with the terms of the group contract. If the group policyholder does not pay the renewal premium by the end of the grace period, the group contract terminates.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-120\">A grace period provision in a group life insurance contract may state that if a contract terminates for nonpayment of premium, the group policyholder must pay the premium for the coverage provided during the grace period. In contrast, the grace period provision in an individual life insurance policy states that coverage continues in force throughout the policy’s grace period, regardless of whether the premium is ever paid.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-58\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-7\">Termination of an Insured’s Coverage While the Group Contract Remains in Force</h4> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-121\">An insured’s coverage can end even though the group life insurance contract remains in force. Most group life insurance contracts specify that an insured’s coverage ends in the following situations:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-58\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-122\">The insured’s employment or group membership ends.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-59\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-123\">The insured ceases to be eligible for coverage. For example, the insured may no longer be part of the class of employees covered under the group contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-60\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-124\">The insured does not make a required contribution to the cost of coverage.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-59\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-5\">Conversion Privilege</h3> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-125\">Most state insurance laws require that group life insurance contracts include a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-conversionprivilege\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-35\" role=\"doc-glossref\">conversion privilege</span>, which is a provision that gives the insured the right to obtain an individual life insurance policy when group life insurance coverage ends due to specified reasons. Individual life insurance policies do not contain this provision.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-126\">According to the Group Life Insurance Model Act, an eligible insured is entitled to obtain individual life insurance coverage without providing evidence of insurability by applying for the individual policy and paying the initial premium within 31 days after her group life insurance coverage ends.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-127\">If a covered person dies during the 31-day conversion period and has not been issued an individual policy, then the insurer must pay a death benefit equal to the amount of individual insurance that the insured was entitled to purchase under the conversion privilege.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-128\">The conversion privilege varies, depending on whether coverage ends because (1) the <em>insured </em>is no longer employed or is no longer a member of a covered class under the contract or (2) the <em>group contract</em> ends or is amended to terminate the coverage of a class of insureds.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-129\"><strong>If the insured’s coverage ends because his employment ends or he is no longer a member of a covered class under the contract</strong>, then the insured must be given the option to purchase any type of individual policy that the insurer issues. However, the insurer may exclude the option of purchasing term insurance. The premium for the individual policy must be at the insurer’s standard rate for that policy based on the insured’s risk class and age. The amount of insurance provided is limited to the amount of group life insurance that ended, less any amount of group life insurance for which the insured becomes eligible within 31 days after his coverage ends.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-60\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-130\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-61\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-131\">Jenny Park’s employment ends with the ABC Company. Jenny was insured for $75,000 under ABC’s group life insurance contract. Ten days later, Ms. Park begins employment with the XYZ Company, where she is eligible for $50,000 of group life insurance coverage.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-131a\"><strong>Analysis.</strong> The maximum amount of group life insurance coverage that Ms. Park can convert to an individual life insurance policy is $25,000. This is the amount of group life insurance that ended minus the amount of group life insurance for which Ms. Park became eligible within 31 days after her coverage ended ($75,000 <wbr />– <wbr />$50,000&#160;=&#160;$25,000). </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-132\">James Hart’s employment ends with the ABC Company. James was insured for $75,000 under ABC’s group life insurance contract. Forty days later, Mr. Hart begins employment with the XYZ Company, where he is eligible for $50,000 of group life insurance coverage.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-133\"><strong>Analysis.</strong> The maximum amount of group life insurance coverage Mr. Hart can convert to an individual life insurance policy under the ABC group contract is $75,000. Because Mr. Hart became eligible for group life insurance more than 31 days after his coverage under the ABC contract ended, he may convert the full amount of group insurance to an individual life insurance policy.</p> </div> </div> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-134\"><strong>If the insured’s coverage ends because the group contract ends or because the group contract is amended so as to terminate the coverage of a class of insureds</strong>, then each covered person whose coverage ends is entitled to obtain an individual life insurance policy, provided the person was insured under the group contract for at least five years. With one exception, this conversion privilege is subject to the same terms as above. The amount of insurance is limited to the <em>lesser of</em> (1) $10,000 or (2) the amount of group life insurance that ended, minus the amount of group life insurance for which the insured becomes eligible within 31 days after termination.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-62\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-135\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-63\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-136\">All employees of the ABC Company are insured for $75,000 under the group contract with Core Life. ABC ends its group life insurance contract with Core Life and enters into a new group life insurance contract with Letter Life. Under the new contract, all employees are insured for $50,000.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-136a\"><strong>Analysis.</strong> The amount of group life insurance that ended minus the amount of group life insurance provided under the new contract is greater than $10,000 ($75,000 <wbr />– <wbr />$50,000 = $25,000). Thus, the maximum amount of group life insurance coverage that an ABC employee can convert to an individual life insurance policy with Core Life is $10,000. </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-4-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"ms\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-4\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-137\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-63\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-4-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-138\">Each person insured under a group life insurance contract has the right to name the beneficiary who will receive the proceeds payable under the contract.

In this section, we describe a few of the federal laws that apply to group insurance and group retirement plans. As we saw in Chapter 3, U.S. federal employment laws have been enacted to ensure that all employees are treated fairly in the workplace. Employment laws prohibit discrimination regarding hiring, advancement, wages, and other terms and conditions of employment, such as employee benefits. Employer-sponsored plans that provide group life insurance and retirement plans must comply with all applicable federal employment-related laws. Three such laws are ADEA, ADA, and ERISA.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-75\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-6\">ADEA</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-151\">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) is a federal law that protects workers who are age 40 and older from being discriminated against because of their age. The ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees. Because the cost of providing group life insurance benefits to older workers is greater than the cost of providing the same benefits to younger workers, older workers are at risk of experiencing discrimination regarding employee benefits. The ADEA seeks to protect older workers from this type of discrimination.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-152\">The ADEA permits employers to reduce the level of certain group life insurance benefits so that the cost to the employer of providing these benefits to older workers is no greater than the cost of providing the full benefits to younger workers. For example, the life insurance benefit might be reduced to 65 percent at age 65 if the actual amount of payment made or cost incurred on behalf of the 65-year-old is no less than that made or incurred on behalf of a younger worker. In other words, the ADEA requires that an employer’s premium contributions for benefits provided to older workers be at least equal to the employer’s premium contributions for benefits provided to younger workers.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-76\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-7\">ADA</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-153\">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that protects people with disabilities against all types of discrimination, including employment discrimination. The ADA requires that people with disabilities have equal access to the same group life insurance benefits available to other employees. The ADA allows benefit limitations but prohibits the denial or limitation of benefits based solely on the fact that a person has a disability. A health-related distinction in a benefit plan is a prohibited disability-based limitation if it singles out a particular disability, a discrete group of disabilities, or disability in general.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-77\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-8\">ERISA</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-154\">Most employer-sponsored group insurance plans and retirement plans in the United States must comply with the <em>Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</em>, which, as we saw in Chapter 7, is a federal law designed to ensure that retirement and welfare benefit plans meet certain minimum plan requirements. ERISA does not require employers to establish a plan. However, if an employer does establish a plan, then in most cases the plan must comply with ERISA. The purpose of ERISA’s minimum plan requirements is to safeguard the benefits of covered employees and group members.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-155\">Although ERISA includes “retirement income security” in its title, the law applies to many types of employee benefits in addition to retirement plans. In this section, we describe ERISA requirements that apply to both retirement and welfare benefit plans. Later in this chapter, we describe ERISA requirements that apply only to retirement plans.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-156\">Under ERISA, a <em>welfare benefit plan</em> is a plan that an employer establishes to provide specified benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. One such benefit is a death benefit provided by life insurance coverage. For ERISA purposes, a welfare benefit plan is a plan that an employer establishes to provide any of the benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries that are shown in Figure 9.1.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:831px;\" id=\"figure9-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-157\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-40\">Figure 9.1</span> ERISA Welfare Benefit Plans</p> <img alt=\"ERISA Welfare Benefit Plans\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-87\" src=\"../../imgs/9-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-78\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure9-1\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-41\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-79\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure9-1\" id=\"loma311-ch9-a-15\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 9-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-158\">ERISA defines the following parties in a welfare benefit plan and/or retirement plan:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-159\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-plansponsor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-42\" role=\"doc-glossref\">plan sponsor</span> is a specified party that establishes an ERISA welfare benefit plan and/or retirement plan for the benefit of its employees or members.

The requirements described in this section apply to welfare benefit plans as well as retirement plans.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-80\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-8\">ERISA Plan Documentation</h4> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-164\">ERISA imposes various disclosure and reporting requirements on welfare benefit plans and retirement plans. The law requires these plans to be established and maintained according to a written <em>plan document</em>. Among other things, the plan document must describe</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-65\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-165\">The benefits to be provided by the plan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-66\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-166\">How the plan will be funded</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-67\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-167\">The procedure that will be followed to amend the plan</p> </li> </ul> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-168\">The plan document must name the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, and one or more fiduciaries who are responsible for controlling and managing the operation of the plan.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-169\">A summary plan description must be provided to each plan participant and to the federal Department of Labor (DOL). A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-summaryplandescription\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">summary plan description (SPD)</span> is an abbreviated version of the plan document that is understandable by the average plan participant and that reasonably informs participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan. If the plan changes significantly, each participant and the DOL must receive a <em>summary of material modifications (SMM).</em> ERISA also requires that an annual report be filed with the Internal Revenue Service. Figure 9.2 lists some of the information that must be included in plan documents and summary plan descriptions.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1183px;\" id=\"figure9-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-170\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-47\">Figure 9.2</span> ERISA Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions</p> <img alt=\"ERISA Plan Documents and Summary Plan Descriptions\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-88\" src=\"../../imgs/9-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-81\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure9-2\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-48\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-82\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure9-2\" id=\"loma311-ch9-a-16\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 9-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-83\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-9\">ERISA Plan Administration</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-171\">Typically, administrative duties under an ERISA plan are performed by plan administrators. The plan sponsor must name a plan administrator, who may be a specified individual or a committee formed for the purpose of handling the plan’s administrative needs. The plan administrator may work with a third party to help ensure that the plan operates according to its terms. For instance, for group life insurance plans, plan sponsors usually contract with insurance companies to provide much of the plan administration. Similarly, for retirement plans, many plan sponsors contract with financial services firms that provide administrative services, such as accounting, actuarial, disbursement, and reporting services. For ERISA purposes, however, the plan sponsor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the plan complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Plan administrators may perform some or all of the following duties:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-68\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-172\">Enrolling new employees in the plan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-69\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-173\">Communicating plan changes to plan participants</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-174\">Maintaining records relating to hiring, participation, and termination of plan participants</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-71\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-175\">Acting as a resource for plan participants regarding matters related to the plan</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-84\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch9-h4-10\">ERISA Plan Fiduciaries</h4> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-176\">Under ERISA, fiduciary duties encompass a broad range of activities and may include both administrative duties and asset management duties. ERISA requires each welfare benefit plan and retirement plan to name one or more plan fiduciaries in its plan document. Typically, the named plan fiduciary is either the plan sponsor or the plan administrator. The purpose of requiring a named fiduciary is to give plan participants the name of at least one person who is responsible for the administration and operation of the plan. This requirement, however, does not limit fiduciary responsibility to the fiduciary named in the plan document. According to ERISA, other unnamed persons may be considered fiduciaries if they perform any of the following duties:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-72\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-177\">Exercising discretionary authority or control over the management of the plan or over assets held under the plan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-73\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-178\">Exercising any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration of the plan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-179\">Rendering investment advice for direct or indirect compensation</p> </li> </ul> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-180\">Fiduciaries have a duty to act solely in the interest of plan participants and plan beneficiaries. They must act for the exclusive purpose of providing plan benefits and defraying reasonable administrative expenses. According to ERISA, fiduciaries must use the same care, skill, prudence, and diligence that a prudent person who is familiar with such matters would use under the circumstances. Plan fiduciaries who fail to perform their fiduciary duty can be held personally liable for any losses or unreasonable expenses that result from a breach of that duty. In some cases, criminal penalties can be imposed on plan fiduciaries.</p> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-181\">In addition to being held personally liable for any breach caused by his own actions, a plan fiduciary can be held liable for the breach of another fiduciary, who, in this context, is referred to as a <em>cofiduciary</em>. When a fiduciary discovers the breach of a cofiduciary, he must take steps to correct the situation, which may include suing the cofiduciary if necessary. A fiduciary will usually be held liable for the breach of a cofiduciary in the following situations:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-16\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-182\">The fiduciary knowingly participates in or knowingly conceals a breach by a cofiduciary.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-183\">The fiduciary has knowledge of a breach by a cofiduciary and does not take steps to correct the situation.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-184\">The fiduciary fails to comply with ERISA, and this failure enables a cofiduciary to commit a breach.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-6\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-185\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-89\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-6-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-186\">True/False: Under ERISA, the purpose of requiring a named fiduciary is to give plan participants the name of the person who is responsible for the administration and operation of the plan.

A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-qualifiedplan\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-52\" role=\"doc-glossref\">qualified plan</span> is a group retirement plan that receives favorable federal income tax treatment because it meets specified requirements included in ERISA and federal tax laws. Tax laws provide incentives that apply to plan sponsors as well as plan participants. A qualified retirement plan can be structured in one of two ways.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-192\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-definedbenefitplan\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-53\" role=\"doc-glossref\">defined benefit plan</span> is a type of retirement plan that uses a formula to determine the benefit amount that each plan participant will receive during retirement. The defined benefit formula may be based on the employee’s pay and/or years of service and usually is described in terms of a monthly benefit. Under a defined benefit plan, the plan sponsor must contribute enough assets to the plan to provide the promised benefits.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-193\">Most defined benefit plans are structured as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-pensionplan\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-54\" role=\"doc-glossref\">pension plan</span>, which is an arrangement under which a plan sponsor provides plan participants with a lifetime income benefit that begins at retirement.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-194\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-definedcontributionplan\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-55\" role=\"doc-glossref\">defined contribution plan</span> is a type of group retirement plan that is funded by contributions from the plan sponsor and/or plan participants and specifies the annual contribution that the plan sponsor will deposit into the plan on behalf of each plan participant, if applicable. The plan participants and plan sponsor can deduct their contributions from their taxable income, subject to limits. Contributions are allocated to each plan participant’s account and invested and accumulated on behalf of the participant. The retirement benefit is based on the total amount in the participant’s account at retirement. The plan structure determines (1) if plan sponsor contributions are mandatory or voluntary, (2) if plan participants make contributions, and (3) how benefits are paid.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-195\">The most common defined contribution plan is the <em>401(k) plan</em>, which permits a certain type of employer group to establish a retirement plan for its employees. The term <em>401(k)</em> comes from the section of the Internal Revenue Code that defines this type of group. Figure 9.3 shows examples of defined contribution plans and their features.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1051px;\" id=\"figure9-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-196\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-56\">Figure 9.3</span> Examples of Defined Contribution Plans</p> <img alt=\"Examples of Defined Contribution Plans\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-99\" src=\"../../imgs/9-3figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-89\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure9-3\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-57\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-90\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure9-3\" id=\"loma311-ch9-a-18\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 9-3 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-197\">ERISA provides the majority of the regulation for retirement plans in the United States. The ERISA administrative, fiduciary, and plan documentation requirements we described earlier in this chapter apply to qualified retirement plans as well as welfare benefit plans. In addition, qualified retirement plans must meet ERISA requirements with regard to participation, vesting, nondiscrimination, funding, distributions, and plan termination.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-91\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-9\">Participation</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-198\">Each retirement plan defines the requirements employees must meet in order to be eligible for participation in the plan. <em>Participation</em> refers to the inclusion of an individual in a retirement plan. Qualified retirement plans must meet minimum standards for participation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-199\">Generally, a plan cannot exclude employees who have attained a specified maximum age. Also, a plan cannot require that an employee complete a period of service longer than one year or be older than 21 to participate, whichever happens later.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-92\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-200\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-93\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-201\">Anne Robinson is age 19 when she begins employment at Rowan Glassworks. She may be excluded from participation in Rowan’s qualified plan until she attains age 21.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-202\"><strong>Analysis.</strong> Because Ms. Robinson was not yet age 21 at the time she completed one year of service, Rowan may exclude her from participation in the plan until she attains age 21.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-203\">George Geary is age 22 when he begins employment at Rowan Glassworks. He may be excluded from participation in Rowan’s qualified plan until he completes one year of service.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-204\"><strong>Analysis.</strong> Because Mr. Geary is older than 21 at the time his employment begins, he cannot be excluded from participation because of his age. However, Rowan may exclude him from participation in the plan until he completes one year of service.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-205\">One exception to the above rule is when employees become <em>fully vested</em> (described below) after two years of service. In this case, the plan may impose a minimum service requirement of two years.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-206\">Note that a qualified plan is not required to have a minimum age requirement. A plan may allow a person to participate in the plan before she reaches the age of 21. In addition, regulatory requirements define how a year of service is measured.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-207\">Qualified plans also must meet minimum requirements as to the number of plan participants. Minimum participation requirements are met if the plan covers at least a specified number of employees or a specified percentage of all employees.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-94\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-10\">Vesting</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-208\">A plan participant is <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-vested\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-58\" role=\"doc-glossref\">vested</span> when he has the right to receive partial or full benefits under the plan even if his employment ends before he retires.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-209\"><em>Participant contributions.</em> A qualified retirement plan must provide that each participant is immediately vested in the accrued benefit funded by <em>his own contributions</em>. The participant’s right to such benefits is nonforfeitable, which means that this right cannot be taken away.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-210\"><em>Plan sponsor contributions.</em> A qualified retirement plan must include a minimum vesting schedule that specifies when a plan participant has the right to receive benefits funded by the<em> plan sponsor’s contributions</em>.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-211\">All plans must comply with U.S. federal tax laws that set minimum vesting schedules. A vesting schedule specifies how plan participants are vested in a certain percentage of the plan sponsor’s contributions at certain points in their employment. When a plan participant is vested in a plan, he owns the applicable value of the plan sponsor’s contributions even if his employment ends. The details of the vesting schedule can vary depending on whether the plan is a defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan. The percentage may increase gradually over a number of years, sometimes called <em>graded or graduated vesting</em>. Alternatively, the percentage may increase from 0 percent to 100 percent at a certain point in the plan participant’s employment, sometimes called <em>cliff vesting</em>.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-95\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-212\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-96\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-213\">The vesting schedule at the ABC Company states that employees are 25 percent vested in accrued employer-funded contributions after one year, 50 percent vested after two years, 75 percent vested after three years, and 100 percent vested after four years. This is called <em>graded </em>or<em> graduated vesting.</em> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-214\">The vesting schedule at the XYZ Company states that employees are 100 percent vested in accrued employer-funded contributions after four years. Until that time, employees are not vested in accrued employer-funded contributions. This is called <em>cliff vesting.</em> </p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-97\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-11\">Nondiscrimination</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-215\">Federal tax laws and regulations contain complex rules and tests that are used to evaluate whether a qualified retirement plan is discriminatory. These rules and tests are intended to ensure that plans do not unfairly discriminate in favor of employees who are defined as highly compensated. Following are three such tests.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-18\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-80\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-216\">Contributions <em>or</em> benefits may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees. Note that this requirement contains the word “or.” This means a <em>defined benefit plan</em> must demonstrate nondiscrimination by testing either contributions or benefits. A <em>defined contribution plan</em>, on the other hand, must perform nondiscrimination testing only on contributions, since the eventual benefits are not known in advance.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-81\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-217\">Plan benefits, rights, and features must be made available to employees in a nondiscriminatory manner.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-82\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-218\">The effect of plan amendments and plan terminations must be nondiscriminatory.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-219\">ERISA imposes additional requirements on <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-topheavyplans\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-59\" role=\"doc-glossref\">top-heavy plans</span>, which are plans under which, for a given plan year, the present value of accrued benefits for <em>key employees</em> exceeds a specified percentage of the present value of accrued benefits for <em>all employees</em>. Tax laws in the United States define which individuals are considered key employees. The definition includes the employer’s officers, owners, and highly paid employees. If a qualified plan becomes top-heavy, the plan must comply with additional requirements to remain a qualified plan.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-98\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-12\">Funding</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-220\">ERISA imposes minimum funding requirements to ensure that qualified plans have the funds needed to provide promised benefits. These requirements differ depending on whether the plan is (1) a defined contribution plan or (2) a defined benefit plan, for which the funding requirements are more stringent.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-19\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-83\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-221\">A <em>defined contribution plan</em> meets the minimum funding requirements in a given year when the specified contribution amounts are actually made to plan participants’ accounts.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-84\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-222\">A <em>defined benefit plan</em> meets ERISA’s minimum funding requirements when it has enough assets to cover its estimated future benefits. ERISA limits the actuarial methods and assumptions that may be used to estimate the contributions needed to fund future benefits. As a general rule, the defined benefit plan sponsor must fund its benefit obligation in advance.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-223\">ERISA requires that the assets of a retirement plan be held separately from the plan sponsor’s general assets. The plan sponsor can separate retirement plan assets from its general assets by allowing the retirement assets to be held by (1) a bank, (2) a life insurance company under various contracts designated for this purpose, or (3) another financial firm. The financial institution in which qualified group retirement plan assets are held is called a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-fundingagency\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-60\" role=\"doc-glossref\">funding agency</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-224\">Regardless of whether retirement plan assets are held by a bank, an insurer, or another financial firm, the plan sponsor must choose a funding instrument when establishing the plan. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-fundinginstrument\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-61\" role=\"doc-glossref\">funding instrument</span>, also known as a <em>funding vehicle</em>, is an arrangement for investing qualified group retirement plan assets. A plan sponsor usually chooses a funding instrument based on how it wants the plan administered and the amount of flexibility available in the plan design. The most common funding instrument for a qualified retirement plan is a trust.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-225\">A trust established for a qualified retirement plan is based on the same legal principles as trusts used for other purposes. The grantor of the trust is the plan sponsor. The plan trustee may be a corporation, such as a bank or trust company, or it may be a named individual. The trust beneficiaries are the plan participants.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-226\">The terms under which the trust operates are specified in a <em>trust agreement</em>. This agreement addresses the receipt, investment, and disbursement of the retirement plan’s assets. Plan trustees may be required to perform any of the following duties:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-20\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-85\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-227\">Receiving and investing employer contributions</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-86\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-228\">Providing periodic reports to the plan sponsor</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-87\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-229\">Paying benefits under the plan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-88\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-230\">Maintaining the appropriate administrative records</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-231\">Plan trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to manage and invest plan assets solely for the benefit of the plan participants. In some plans, investment managers rather than plan trustees are responsible for investing plan assets. In any case, individuals responsible for investing plan assets must act in accordance with plan documents and plan investment policies. Plan assets may be invested in a variety of investment instruments, including deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-99\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-13\">Distributions</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-232\">Federal income tax laws in the United States impose requirements on distributions of qualified plans. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-distributions\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-62\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Distributions</span> are benefits paid to plan participants, usually following retirement.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-233\">Some plans, primarily defined benefit plans, must state that the normal form of benefit payment for a participant who is married is a qualified joint and survivor life annuity (QJSA). With a QJSA, the surviving spouse of a deceased plan participant receives specified survivor benefits. A QJSA pays monthly benefits for the lifetime of both the plan participant and the participant’s spouse. If the plan participant dies first, then the surviving spouse receives a reduced benefit. A plan participant may waive the QJSA, but only with the consent of her spouse. A married plan participant who waives the QJSA typically receives a <em>single life annuity</em>, also called a <em>straight life annuity</em>, under which payments continue for the lifetime of the participant and cease at the participant’s death.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-234\">Qualified plans must contain specified provisions regarding when plan distributions will begin. Distributions may be pension payments from defined benefit plans or minimum distributions from defined contribution plans. A plan participant who retires at her normal retirement age must generally begin receiving plan distributions by her <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-requiredbeginningdate\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-63\" role=\"doc-glossref\">required beginning date (RBD).</span> The RBD is based on when the plan participant reached age 70 ½. Participants who attained age 70 ½ prior to December 30, 2019 have an RBD of April 1 of the year following the year they reached age 70 ½. Participants who attained age 70 ½ after December 30, 2019 have an RBD of April 1 of the year following the year they reach age 72. Depending on the terms of the plan, a participant who is still working may be allowed to postpone distributions past her RBD. In this case, she does not have to start taking distributions until April 1 of the year after she retires.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-235\">Qualified plans also must comply with requirements specifying the periods over which distributions must be paid. Penalties are imposed on plan participants for whom these distribution requirements are not met, and a plan’s failure to meet such requirements may result in the plan losing its tax-qualified status.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch9-div-100\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch9-h3-14\">Plan Termination</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-236\">To meet the requirements for a qualified plan, a retirement plan must be established as a permanent plan. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent plan sponsors from establishing plans for only a few years for the sole purpose of obtaining tax benefits.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-237\">Despite the “permanence” requirement, retirement plans can be terminated. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-plantermination\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-64\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Plan termination</span>describes the ending of a group retirement plan when plan benefits cease to accrue. A retirement plan may terminate for various reasons. For instance, the plan sponsor may </p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch9-ul-21\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-89\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-238\">Go out of business</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-90\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-239\">Decide to replace its current retirement plan with another type of retirement plan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch9-li-91\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch9-p-240\">Conclude that it can no longer afford to fund the plan</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-241\">If a plan sponsor can no longer afford to fund the plan, it may elect a partial plan termination. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch9-gt-partialplantermination\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch9-span-65\" role=\"doc-glossref\">partial plan termination</span> occurs when a plan sponsor terminates a retirement plan for one group of plan participants but continues the plan for another group of participants. For instance, an employer may continue a retirement plan for employees who have been employed for longer than a specified number of years, but terminate the plan for newer employees.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-242\">ERISA has established an insurance program, administered by a federal corporation known as the <em>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)</em>, which provides payment of retirement benefits for participants in defined benefit retirement plans that become financially unable to pay benefits. Covered plans are required to pay premiums to the PBGC, which invests those premiums and uses the funds to pay covered benefits. Statutory limits establish the amount of plan benefits the PBGC can guarantee and the types of benefits that are guaranteed.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-243\">Although defined contribution plans are not protected by the insurance program administered by the PBGC, other U.S. laws govern the termination of these plans. Plan sponsors must follow specified procedures to divide plan assets among the plan participants when a defined contribution plan ends.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-7-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-7\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-244\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch9-img-100\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch9-question-7-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch9-p-245\">True/False: A defined contribution plan is a type of U.S. group retirement plan that is funded by contributions from the plan sponsor and/or plan participants.

Recall from Chapter 4 that individual life insurance contracts can be characterized as</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-25\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-24\"><em>Informal contracts</em> that require no special formalities to be valid</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-26\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-25\"><em>Unilateral contracts</em> under which only one party—the insurer—makes legally enforceable promises</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-27\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-26\"><em>Aleatory contracts</em> under which one party—the policyowner—provides something of value to another party—the insurer—in exchange for a conditional promise</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-28\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-27\"><em>Contracts of adhesion</em> that one party—the insurer—prepares and that the other party—the applicant—must accept or reject as a whole without any bargaining between the parties</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-28\">In particular, a life insurance contract is an informal contract. However, laws in many states require insurance contracts to be in writing. Insurance contracts typically are expressed in written form—whether required by law or not—for practical reasons. Putting the contract in writing helps prevent misunderstandings between the parties as to the terms of their agreement. A written contract also provides a permanent record of the agreement, which may remain in force for many years.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-29\">As with the formation of other informal contracts, the parties must meet four requirements to form a valid life insurance contract: (1) the parties must mutually assent to the contract, (2) they must exchange legally adequate consideration, (3) they must have contractual capacity, and (4) the contract must be for a lawful purpose.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-10\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-1\">Mutual Assent</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-30\">The parties manifest their mutual assent to a life insurance contract when one party makes a definite offer to contract and the other party accepts that offer unconditionally.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-11\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-1\">Offer and Acceptance</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-31\">Applicants for insurance generally make an offer to enter into an insurance contract by completing an application for insurance and submitting it to an insurer along with payment of the initial premium for the applied-for policy. The insurer can accept an applicant’s offer by (1) issuing a policy that contains the same terms as those stated in the applicant’s offer and (2) delivering the policy to the applicant. When a valid contract is created, the applicant becomes the policyowner.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-32\">If an applicant does not pay the initial premium when she submits an application for insurance, then she has not made an offer. Rather, she has invited the <em>insurer</em> to make an offer. The insurer can make an offer to contract by issuing a policy and delivering it to the applicant. Note that the policy the insurer issues and delivers need not be the same policy the applicant applied for. The applicant can accept the insurer’s offer by accepting the policy and paying the initial premium.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-12\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-2\">Counteroffers</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-33\">When an insurer issues a policy on terms other than those applied for, the insurer has rejected the initial offer and has made a counteroffer. An insurer often makes a counteroffer when it classifies the prospective insured as a higher risk than the prospective insured has applied for. An applicant can accept an insurer’s counteroffer by accepting delivery of the policy and agreeing to the new contract terms that the insurer has proposed.

Thus, an applicant who has applied for an insurance policy and paid the initial premium has the right to withdraw that offer at any time before the insurer accepts the offer. If an applicant withdraws an offer, then the insurer generally must return the premium the applicant paid.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-27\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-37\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-28\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-38\">David Hu applied for an insurance policy on his life from the Blue Life Insurance Company and paid the initial premium. The next day, he spoke to an agent who represented the Green Life Insurance Company. Mr. Hu decided that he could purchase a policy more suited to his needs from Green Life. Blue Life had not yet accepted Mr. Hu’s application. Mr. Hu then completed an application for a policy from Green Life and submitted the application. In this situation, Mr. Hu has the right to withdraw his application from Blue Life and to receive a refund of the premium he paid to Blue Life.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-39\">Although insurers also have the right to withdraw an offer to enter into an insurance contract, they usually do not exercise that right, as long as they can adequately adjust the premium to consider the prospective insured’s risk profile. Most insurers prefer to avoid withdrawing such offers, as regularly withdrawing offers may establish a reputation for poor reliability.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-29\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-4\">Rejecting an Offer</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-40\">Because a contract is a consensual relationship, the offeree can reject an offer or counteroffer from the other party. An applicant for insurance has the right to reject any offer made by an insurer and to receive a refund of the initial premium she paid, until the offer is accepted.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-30\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-41\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-31\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-42\">Ricardo Bellini applied for a policy at standard premium rates. The insurer rejected that offer and made a counteroffer by issuing a policy at a higher-than standard premium rate. If Mr. Bellini does not want to pay the higher premiums, he can reject the insurer’s counteroffer and receive a refund of the initial premium he paid.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-43\">Within certain limits, insurers also have the right to reject offers to contract. For example, an insurer rejects an application when the insurer’s underwriters find that the proposed insured presents too great a risk to be eligible for insurance. In such instances, the insurer is rejecting an offer to contract. State insurance laws, however, prohibit insurers from unfairly discriminating against proposed insureds because of factors such as race, national origin, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, and certain mental and physical impairments. For this reason, insurers who reject an offer to contract must base that decision on recognized actuarial principles or actual or reasonably anticipated experience. Insurers generally try to offer coverage on some basis to as many proposed insureds as possible.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-32\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-2\">Adequate Consideration</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-44\">As an informal contract, a life insurance contract must be supported by legally adequate consideration in order to be valid. The legally adequate consideration for a life insurance contract consists of the applicant’s submission of an application for insurance and payment of the initial premium, and the insurer’s promise to pay contractual benefits.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-33\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-3\">Contractual Capacity</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-45\">For an insurance contract to be valid, the parties to the contract must have contractual capacity. Insurers that are licensed to conduct business within the applicable state have the legal capacity to enter into insurance contracts in the state. Applicants for insurance who are competent adults have the capacity to enter into an insurance contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-46\">Because the law does not consider insurance a necessity, courts have held that by default insurance contracts entered into by a minor generally are voidable by the minor. When a minor decides to avoid an insurance contract, she is entitled to a refund of the premiums she paid. As a result, the minor benefits from the insurance coverage in existence before she avoided the contract and pays nothing for it. However, this ruling discouraged insurers from entering into life insurance contracts with minors, even if the minors could have benefited from receiving life insurance coverage.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-47\">Most states modified this common law rule by enacting laws that enable minors of a stated minimum age to enter into enforceable life insurance contracts. Thus, insurers that provide coverage to minors are protected against a minor’s ability to avoid such a contract, and are therefore more willing to offer insurance to minors. The following are some of the limitations that state laws place on minors’ purchases of life insurance:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-36\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-48\">The age at which minors may enter into valid and binding insurance contracts varies from age 14 to age 16, depending on the state.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-37\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-49\">The types of insurance that minors may purchase vary by state law. Some states permit minors to purchase life and health insurance on their own lives, and other states permit minors to purchase life and health insurance on any individual in whose life or health the minor has an insurable interest.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-38\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-50\">Laws vary as to the individuals who may be named as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy purchased by a minor on her own life. Many states, for example, require the beneficiary of such a policy to be the minor’s parent or legal guardian, spouse, child, brother, or sister.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-51\">Many other jurisdictions around the world have enacted laws to enable minors of a specified age to purchase insurance. Figure 10.1 lists the ages in a few jurisdictions at which individuals generally are able to purchase life insurance.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:975px;\" id=\"figure10-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-52\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-11\">Figure 10.1</span> Age at Which Minors Can Purchase Insurance</p> <img alt=\"Age at Which Minors Can Purchase Insurance\" id=\"loma311-ch10-img-34\" src=\"../../imgs/10-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-34\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure10-1\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-12\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-35\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure10-1\" id=\"loma311-ch10-a-11\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 10-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-36\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-4\">Lawful Purpose: Insurable Interest</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-53\">When the purpose of an agreement is illegal, the agreement is illegal and void. An agreement’s purpose is illegal if it violates public policy or violates a principle of common law. To be valid, an informal contract must have a lawful purpose. In the formation of a life insurance contract, the lawful purpose requirement is met if an insurable interest is present. Many early life insurance policies were purchased as wagers by individuals who had no relationship at all with the insured—in particular, people used life insurance policies to make a profit on the deaths of public figures before courts instituted the requirement of an insurable interest.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-54\">In addition, the ability to gain substantial profits from an insured’s death creates the danger of someone insuring another person with the intent of killing the insured and collecting the policy proceeds. The insurable interest requirement is intended to prevent such situations and provides assurance that the insurance contract is being made for the lawful purpose of providing protection against financial loss, rather than for an unlawful purpose. Most countries around the world impose an insurable interest requirement on the formation of life insurance contracts. The insight below provides a few examples of how the specific requirements for insurable interest vary from country to country.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-37\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Insurable Interest Requirements in Various Countries\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch10-img-35\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-55\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-38\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-56\">Insurable Interest Requirements in Various Countries</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-57\"><strong>Australia:</strong> The Insurance Contracts Act was amended in 2005 to end the insurable interest requirement for the formation of a valid life insurance contract. The act now states that a life insurance contract is not void for lack of insurable interest when the contract is created.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-58\"><strong>Canada:</strong> All provinces require an applicant to have an insurable interest in the person insured by a life insurance policy when the contract is formed. However, if the proposed insured consents in writing to the issuance of a policy on his life, then the insurance contract is valid even if the applicant has no insurable interest in the proposed insured.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-59\">An insurable interest is presumed to exist between certain family members. In the common law provinces, an insurable interest exists between a person and (1) his children and grandchildren, (2) his spouse, and (3) anyone who contributes to his support or education. In Quebec, an insurable interest exists between a person and (1) his spouse, (2) his descendants and his spouse’s descendants, and (3) anyone who contributes to his support or education.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-60\"><strong>Malaysia:</strong> An insurable interest is deemed to exist between a person and (1) his spouse and his child or ward who is under the age of majority at the time the insurance is effected, (2) his employee, or (3) a person on whom he is wholly or partly dependent when the insurance is effected.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-61\">In the United States, for the contract to be valid, a policyowner must have an insurable interest in the insured person when the life insurance policy is issued. Generally, an insurable interest exists when a person is likely to benefit if the insured continues to live and is likely to suffer some loss or detriment if the insured dies. Whether the requirement is met in a given case is a question of fact. Note that the insurable interest must exist only at the time of contracting and is not required to continue throughout the life of the policy. For example, if a person purchases a life insurance policy on the life of his spouse, the policy remains a valid contract even if the couple later divorces. If a business owner purchases key-person insurance on a key employee, the owner could choose to continue the contract if the employee later left the business. Insurable interest is also not required to continue in the case of a viatical settlement, a transaction that we discuss in Chapter 12.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-62\">In most cases, individual life insurance policies are applied for and owned by the person who is insured by the policy. Some policies, however, are issued to persons other than the insured. Insurable interest requirements vary depending on whether a policy insures the policyowner or someone other than the policyowner.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-39\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-5\">Policyowner Insures His Own Life</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-63\">The law in all states considers a person to have an insurable interest in his own life. In other words, a person can always buy insurance on his own life and generally may name anyone he wishes as beneficiary. Thus, state laws do not require the beneficiary of such a policy to have an insurable interest in the proposed insured’s life.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-40\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-6\">Policyowner Insures Another Person’s Life</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-64\">When a person applies for insurance on another person’s life, the applicant generally must provide the insurer with evidence that she has an insurable interest in the insured’s life. In most states, the law presumes that an insurable interest exists between certain close family members. Thus, an insured’s spouse, mother, father, child, grandparent, grandchild, brother, and sister are each presumed to have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. The law deems the bonds of love and loyalty that exist in such family relationships sufficient to protect the insured. State laws do not presume an insurable interest in the case of more distant relatives, such as cousins, aunts and uncles, and stepchildren.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-65\">Anyone other than a close relative must demonstrate that she has a financial interest in the continued life of the insured to satisfy the insurable interest requirements. For example, an individual who is not a close relative of an insured may be financially dependent on the insured and, thus, would be harmed if the insured died. Business relationships may also give someone a financial interest in another’s continued life. The following are some of the business relationships that create an insurable interest:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-39\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-66\">Partners are each considered to have an insurable interest in the lives of the other partners.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-40\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-67\">An employer has an insurable interest in the lives of its key employees.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-41\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-68\">A creditor has an insurable interest in the lives of its debtors.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-69\">Typically, a person who purchases insurance on another person’s life names himself as the policy beneficiary. Thus, the person who will benefit from the policy after the insured’s death is also the policyowner, who has an insurable interest in the insured’s life. When a person purchases insurance on another person’s life and names a third person as the policy beneficiary, the possibility arises that policy proceeds may become payable to someone with no insurable interest in the insured’s life. To prevent such a situation, statutes in many states require that when a person purchases a policy on another person’s life, the person named as the policy beneficiary must have an insurable interest in the insured’s life.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-41\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-7\">Consent Requirement</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-70\">In addition to the insurable interest requirement, most states require a proposed insured to consent to the issuance of a policy on her life. Without such consent, a policy taken out on the life of another person is void. The consent requirement protects insureds from another person profiting from their deaths without their knowledge. State insurance laws include exceptions that allow an insurance policy to be issued without the insured’s consent. For example,</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-42\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-71\">Most states permit a parent to insure the life of a minor child without the child’s consent.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-43\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-72\">A few states permit one spouse to insure the life of the other spouse without the insured’s consent.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-44\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-73\">A few states permit employers to purchase insurance on the lives of their employees without the employees’ consent.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-42\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-8\">Insurers’ Duty of Care</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-74\">Insurers are careful to make sure that the insurable interest requirement is met before they issue a policy. In addition, many insurers’ underwriting guidelines impose more stringent insurable interest requirements than the requirements imposed by state laws. The task of determining insurable interest is the underwriter’s responsibility. If an insurer fails to exercise reasonable care in evaluating whether the insurable interest requirement is met for a given policy, then the insurer could be subject to tort liability for any harm that befalls an insured who did not consent to the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-75\">In one historical example of the necessity of reasonable care, an insurer was held liable for a young child’s death because the insurer had issued a policy without insurable interest.<span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-13\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch10-en1\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-14\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</span> </span>In this case, the child’s aunt purchased several insurance policies on the child’s life and named herself as the beneficiary. The child did not live with her aunt, and was not financially dependent on her aunt, and the child’s parents did not know that policies had been issued on the child’s life. The aunt poisoned the child and was convicted of murdering the child so that she could collect the insurance policy proceeds. The child’s father then sued the insurer, alleging that the insurer failed to use reasonable care when it issued the policies. The court found that the insurer had failed in its duty to use reasonable care to determine insurable interest, and that the insurer’s failure had resulted in the child’s death. The insurer was required to pay damages for the child’s wrongful death.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-43\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-5\">Policy Delivery</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-76\">An individual life insurance policy typically states that the policy does not become effective until (1) it is delivered to the policyowner and (2) the initial premium is paid. Both requirements must be met during the continued good health of the insured in order for the contract to be effective. Generally the policyowner receives the policy through electronic delivery or accesses the policy through the insurer’s website. In some cases, the insurer mails a physical copy of the policy directly to the policyowner.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-77\">Sometimes a policy is considered to have been delivered even though it never actually reached the policyowner. Delivery in such cases is called <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-constructivedelivery\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-15\" role=\"doc-glossref\">constructive delivery</span>, which is a legally adequate delivery of a life insurance policy that occurs when the insurer parts with control of the policy and intends to be bound to the terms of the contract. </p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-44\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-78\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-45\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-79\">On September 1, Christine Conowitch applied for a policy on her life and paid the initial premium. On September 10, the insurer issued the policy as applied for. On September 11, the insurer mailed a physical copy of the policy to Ms. Conowitch. Ms. Conowitch died on September 12 before the policy arrived in the mail. Courts generally would consider that, because the insurer parted with control of the policy and intended to be bound to it on September 11, the policy had been constructively delivered to Ms. Conowitch at the time of her death. Thus, the policy would be considered effective, and the insurer would be liable to pay the policy death benefit.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-80\">As we saw in Chapter 8, most states require individual life insurance policies to include a free look provision. The <em>free look provision</em> gives the policyowner a specified period—usually 10 days—following delivery of the policy within which to cancel the policy and receive a refund of the premium paid. The free look period allows the policyowner time to review the policy and evaluate whether it is the policy applied for and is the product best suited to the policyowner’s needs. During the free look period, the policy and the coverage it provides are effective and binding on the insurer.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-46\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-6\">Entire Contract</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-81\">Individual life insurance policies generally must include an <em>entire contract provision</em>, which defines the documents that constitute the contract between the insurer and the policyowner. The specific wording of the entire contract provision varies depending on whether the policy is a closed contract or an open contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-82\">With the exception of fraternal insurers, U.S. insurers issue individual life insurance policies that are closed contracts. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-closedcontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-16\" role=\"doc-glossref\">closed contract</span> is a contract for which only those terms and conditions that are printed in—or attached to—the contract are considered to be part of the contract. In a closed life insurance contract, the entire contract provision states that the contract consists of the policy, any attached riders and endorsements, and the attached copy of the application. In Chapter 13, we analyze the importance of the insurer attaching a copy of the application when the insurer delivers the policy to the policyowner.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-83\">Fraternal insurers issue life insurance coverage in the form of an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-opencontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">open contract</span>, which is a contract that identifies the documents that constitute the contract between the parties, but the enumerated documents are not all attached to the contract. Typically, policies issued by fraternal insurers state that the entire contract between the parties consists of the following documents: </p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-84\">The policy and any attached riders and endorsements</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-85\">The fraternal society’s charter, constitution, and bylaws</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-86\">The application for membership in the fraternal society</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-87\">The declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-88\">Typically, a fraternal insurer attaches a copy of the application for membership and the declaration of insurability to the policy delivered to an insured member. Although the fraternal’s charter, constitution, and bylaws are not attached to the policy, these documents are available to society members, and the terms of these documents are enforceable by the parties as part of their contract agreement.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch10-question-2-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch10-question-2\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-89\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch10-img-36\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch10-question-2-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-90\">Insurance contracts require an insurable interest element in order to satisfy the contract requirement of (<strong>adequate consideration</strong> / <strong>lawful purpose</strong>).

The applicant, the insurer, and the financial professional all benefit when the applicant submits the initial premium along with the application. The advantage to the applicant is that, under certain circumstances, the applicant can receive insurance coverage before the policy itself is effective. Although many insurers are attempting to streamline the underwriting process, the process can take several weeks, and many applicants pay the initial premium so that their coverage can begin before the underwriting and policy issue processes are completed. The advantage to the insurer and the financial professional is that an applicant who has paid the initial premium is more likely to accept the policy when it is delivered than is an applicant who has not paid the initial premium.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-102\">When an applicant pays the initial premium with the application, the financial professional gives the applicant a premium receipt that acknowledges the premium payment and often includes a temporary insurance agreement. Such an agreement provides insurance coverage on the proposed insured before a policy is issued and delivered, although such coverage may be subject to certain conditions. A temporary insurance agreement is a contract between the insurer and the life insurance applicant. The contract is formed when the financial professional—who is acting as an authorized agent of the insurer—makes an offer to provide temporary insurance coverage if the applicant pays the initial premium. The applicant accepts the insurer’s offer by paying that premium, and the temporary insurance agreement is then effective.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-103\">A premium receipt that provides temporary insurance coverage states (1) when that coverage becomes effective, (2) the conditions that must be met for the coverage to become effective, and (3) when the coverage will end. Premium receipts also usually state that the temporary insurance coverage is provided subject to the terms of the insurance policy for which the applicant applied.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-63\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-104\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-64\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-105\">If the policy applied for contains a suicide exclusion provision, then the temporary insurance agreement also contains that suicide exclusion provision even if the premium receipt is silent concerning suicide.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-106\">When the terms of a premium receipt conflict with the terms of the policy applied for, then the terms of the premium receipt take precedence.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-65\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-107\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-66\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-108\">Premium receipts often limit the life insurance benefits available to a stated dollar amount, which is often less than the amount of insurance that the applicant applied for. If the proposed insured dies while insured under a temporary insurance agreement, the amount of the death benefit payable is limited to the amount specified in the premium receipt.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-67\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-7\">Types of Temporary Insurance Agreements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-109\">Although the terms of premium receipts vary widely, insurers issue two basic types of receipts: conditional premium receipts and binding premium receipts. Both types of receipts are subject to conditions. In contract law, a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-condition\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-28\" role=\"doc-glossref\">condition</span> is an uncertain event, the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which either creates or extinguishes a party’s duty to perform a contractual promise. Thus, a condition is a contractual term that limits a party’s promise.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-110\">We can categorize conditions as either conditions precedent or conditions subsequent.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-111\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-conditionprecedent\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-29\" role=\"doc-glossref\">condition precedent</span> is a condition that must occur in order to give rise to one party’s duty to perform a promise. For example, an insurer’s promise to pay a life insurance policy death benefit is subject to a condition precedent—the contract must be in force when the event insured against occurs, which in this case is the death of the insured. If the contract is not in force at the time of the insured’s death, then the condition precedent is not met, and the insurer is not liable to pay the policy death benefit.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-112\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-conditionsubsequent\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-30\" role=\"doc-glossref\">condition subsequent</span> is a condition that, if it occurs, cancels one party’s duty to perform a promise. For example, some insurance policies provide that, unless a claimant furnishes the insurer with proof of a covered loss within a stated time after the occurrence of the loss, the insurer has no liability to pay for the loss. The claimant’s failure to provide the insurer with proof of a covered loss within the required period, when the claimant could have done so, is a condition subsequent that relieves the insurer of its duty to pay for the loss.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-68\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-9\">Conditional Premium Receipts</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-113\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-conditionalpremiumreceipt\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">conditional premium receipt</span> provides temporary insurance coverage only if specified conditions are met. One kind of conditional premium receipt is an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-insurabilitypremiumreceipt\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">insurability premium receipt</span>, which provides temporary insurance coverage on condition that the insurer finds the proposed insured to be insurable as a standard or preferred risk.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-114\">In this case, the insurer’s contractual promise is to pay a benefit if the proposed insured dies while the agreement is in force. This promise is subject to the condition precedent that the insurer finds the proposed insured to be insurable as a standard risk on a specified date according to the insurer’s standard underwriting guidelines. The premium receipt states the date on which the insurer will make a decision on the insured’s insurability, which typically is one of the following:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-115\">The date of the premium receipt</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-116\">The date of the application</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-53\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-117\">The date of a required medical examination</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-118\">Watch Video 10.2 for an example of a conditional premium receipt in action.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video10-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-119\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-33\">Video 10.2</span> A Conditional Premium Receipt</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-69\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-70\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-120\">A Conditional Premium Receipt</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/10-2video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

U.S. insurers rarely issue approval premium receipts.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-122\">To protect consumers, some states prohibit insurers and producers from describing a conditional premium receipt as a <em>temporary insurance agreement</em>. Lawmakers in these states reason that the term <em>temporary insurance agreement</em> may cause confusion. If the receipt is described as a <em>temporary agreement</em>, some applicants could think that coverage is in force when it is not.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-82\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch10-h4-10\">Binding Premium Receipts</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-123\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-bindingpremiumreceipt\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-40\" role=\"doc-glossref\">binding premium receipt</span> provides temporary insurance coverage that becomes effective on the date specified in the receipts. Unlike conditional premium receipts, binding premium receipts provide temporary insurance coverage without requiring that specified conditions be met. Compared to the terms of other types of premium receipts, the terms of binding premium receipts are more advantageous to applicants and less advantageous to insurers. Under a binding receipt, the insurer provides insurance coverage before it has the opportunity to evaluate whether the proposed insured is insurable. A sample binding premium receipt is shown in Figure 10.2.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:1239px;\" id=\"figure10-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-124\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-41\">Figure 10.2</span> Sample Binding Premium Receipt</p> <img alt=\"Sample Binding Premium Receipt\" class=\"usesFloatingControlbar\" id=\"loma311-ch10-img-84\" src=\"../../imgs/10-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-83\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure10-2\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-42\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-84\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure10-2\" id=\"loma311-ch10-a-15\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 10-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-125\">Unlike the temporary insurance coverage provided by conditional premium receipts, which is subject to a condition precedent, the coverage provided by a binding premium receipt is subject to a condition subsequent because the insurer has the right to cancel the temporary insurance coverage if certain circumstances occur. Temporary coverage under a binding premium receipt typically remains effective until the earliest of the following occurrences:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-61\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-126\">The insurer issues the applicant a policy.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-62\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-127\">The insurer declines the application.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-63\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-128\">The insurer terminates or suspends coverage under the receipt.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-64\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-129\">A specified time—usually 45 to 60 days—expires.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-85\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-8\">Courts’ Interpretations of Premium Receipts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-130\">Historically, U.S. courts enforced the various types of conditional premium receipts in accordance with the stated terms of those receipts. Many courts continue to enforce the terms of insurability and approval premium receipts. More recently, however, courts in many states have enforced conditional premium receipts as if they were binding premium receipts that provided coverage whether or not a specified condition precedent was met. Courts have followed various types of reasoning to arrive at their decisions:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-14\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-65\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-131\">Some courts have found that the terms of conditional premium receipts were ambiguous. When the terms of a contract of adhesion such as an insurance contract are ambiguous, the rules of contract construction require the court to interpret the court in a way that is most favorable to the policyowner or claimant.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-66\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-132\">Other courts have based their decisions on a legal doctrine known as the <em>doctrine of reasonable expectations</em>, which is related to the reasonable person standard. According to this doctrine, an applicant who pays the initial premium in advance and receives a premium receipt that provides temporary insurance coverage can reasonably assume that he is covered immediately unless it is clearly brought to his attention that coverage is not immediate. In many states, the courts apply this doctrine only if the terms of an insurance contract are ambiguous or if a policy contains exclusions that are written in technical language that the average policyowner would not understand.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-67\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-133\">A few courts have refused to enforce the terms of conditional premium receipts because those terms are unfair to applicants who expect the receipt to provide coverage without being subject to specified conditions.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"question-wrapper\"

The parties to an individual annuity contract are the insurer that issued the annuity and the person who purchased the annuity, commonly referred to as the <em>contract owner</em>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-147\">The parties create a valid annuity contract by meeting the four requirements necessary for any informal contract:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-15\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-68\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-148\"><strong>Mutual assent.</strong> Typically, the process of offer and acceptance is uncomplicated. The applicant completes an application for the type of annuity he wants and the insurer generally issues the contract as applied for.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-69\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-149\"><strong>Adequate consideration. </strong>The applicant for an annuity usually pays all or a part of the consideration required to pay for the annuity when he submits the application. Amounts paid for an annuity often are referred to as <em>annuity considerations</em> as well as premiums.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-150\"><strong>Contractual capacity.</strong> Both parties must have contractual capacity. This requirement helps prevent financial elder abuse—for example, pressuring an older person with impaired judgment to purchase an annuity that is unlikely to repay the initial investment in the person’s lifetime.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-71\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-151\"><strong>Lawful purpose.</strong> Unlike life insurance, an annuity usually does not present the opportunity for the applicant to wager on someone’s life or for someone to benefit from another’s death. A customer usually purchases an annuity for the purpose of managing a need for asset accumulation during the annuity’s accumulation period and for income distribution during retirement or another period of similar financial need. Thus, insurable interest requirements are not imposed. As long as no illegal purposes are involved, the creation of an annuity contract meets the lawful purpose requirement. Money laundering is one example of an illegal purpose for an annuity contract.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-152\">A contract is created between the parties when the insurer issues the contract and delivers it to the contract owner and the contract owner pays the amount required as the first annuity consideration.

Because insurance policies are contracts that are binding on the insurer, insurers generally also require that an agent’s authority to represent the company be specifically defined in the form of a contract.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch10-div-103\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch10-h3-9\">Agency Agreement</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-164\">A financial professional who markets and sells life insurance products on behalf of an insurance company acts as an agent of the insurer. Typically, insurers enter into a written contract, known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch10-gt-agencyagreement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch10-span-50\" role=\"doc-glossref\">agency agreement</span> or <em>agency contract</em>, with each of their financial professionals. The terms of such an agency agreement spell out the rights and duties of the principal (the insurer) and the agent. Some agents sell the products of one insurance company exclusively, while others have agency agreements with multiple insurers. Some of the terms that commonly are included in agency agreements include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch10-ul-17\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-74\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-165\">A statement that the financial professional is either an independent contractor or an employee of the insurance company, whichever the case may be</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-75\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-166\">A description of the financial professional’s authority to represent the company, solicit and take applications, arrange medical examinations, collect initial premiums, and issue premium receipts</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-76\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-167\">Limitations on the financial professional’s authority, specifying that the financial professional cannot change premium rates, alter contracts, incur debts on behalf of the company, or otherwise act outside the scope of granted authority</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-77\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-168\">Performance requirements, particularly with respect to adherence to company rules and the prompt remittance of premiums to the company</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-78\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-169\">A compensation schedule, stating the rate of commissions, service fees, bonuses, and other compensation</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch10-li-79\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch10-p-170\">Termination provisions, stating (1) justifiable causes for termination, (2) the length of time required for notice of termination by either the financial professional or the company, and (3) the obligations of each party after the agency agreement is terminated</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-171\">As the principal in an agency relationship, an insurer has the right to determine the scope of the agent’s authority. The agency agreement spells out the scope of that authority. Because an agent who acts within the scope of his authority has the power to bind his principal, insurers generally are interested in limiting the scope of such authority.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-172\">Agents typically have authorization to issue a premium receipt to an applicant who completes an application and pays the initial premium. Depending on the terms of the receipt, the insurer may be contractually bound to provide temporary insurance coverage under the receipt. With the exception of binding an insurer to providing temporary coverage under a premium receipt, an agent is not generally authorized to enter into binding life insurance contracts on an insurer’s behalf. Only specified employees—usually in the insurer’s home office—have actual authority to approve an application and issue a life insurance policy that is binding on the insurer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-173\">An application for life insurance generally includes a notice to the applicant stating that no policy will become effective unless the application is approved and the insurer’s home office issues a policy. By signing the application, the applicant acknowledges he is aware that the financial professional is not authorized to complete an insurance contract on the insurer’s behalf.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-174\">Agents typically have actual authority to accept <em>initial</em> premium payments on behalf of an insurer. Payment of an initial premium to such an agent is legally considered payment to the insurer. Agents, however, generally do not have actual authority to accept <em>renewal</em> premium payments.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-175\">Sometimes an agent acts outside the scope of his authority and the principal is bound by the act. In these cases, the principal generally is bound because the agent had apparent authority to act on behalf of the principal. For example, assume that a financial professional repeatedly accepts renewal premium payments from one of his clients and remits the payments to the insurer. If the insurer establishes a pattern of accepting the payments from the financial professional, then the insurer has in effect agreed to the financial professional’s actions. Therefore, the insurer probably has conferred apparent authority on the financial professional to accept future renewal premium payments from this client. Payment of a renewal premium to a financial professional who has apparent authority to accept it is payment to the insurer even if the financial professional does not promptly remit the payment to the insurer. The scope of an agent’s authority is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of the situation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-176\">When a financial professional acts as an agent of an insurer, the knowledge that the agent possesses concerning the business he has transacted on behalf of the insurer is considered the knowledge of the insurer. We describe such situations in detail in Chapter 13.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch10-question-7-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"ms\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch10-question-7\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-177\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch10-img-123\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch10-question-7-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch10-p-178\">An agency agreement grants an agent authority to perform certain actions on behalf of an insurer.

These rights involve elements such as beneficiary designations, premium payments, nonforfeiture benefits, policy loans and withdrawals, accelerated death benefits, and reinstatements.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-8\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch11-h3-1\">Right to Name the Beneficiary</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-19\">One of the most important contractual rights in an individual life insurance policy is the policyowner’s right to name the beneficiary who will receive the policy proceeds. The beneficiary may be a named individual, the policyowner’s estate, a corporation, a charitable organization, or any other entity. We describe the naming of a trustee as beneficiary in the next chapter.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-20\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-primarybeneficiary\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-5\" role=\"doc-glossref\">primary beneficiary</span> is the party who, if living, will receive the life insurance policy proceeds after the insured’s death. The policyowner may name more than one primary beneficiary and may indicate how the insurer should divide the proceeds among the beneficiaries. Following the insured’s death, the insurer will pay the policy proceeds in accordance with the policyowner’s wishes as stated in the beneficiary designation, assuming that the designation is valid and clearly stated.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-9\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-21\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-10\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-22\">Ricardo Vargas purchased a $500,000 policy insuring his life. He named his wife, Luiza, and his daughter, Sophia, as equal primary beneficiaries. Both Luiza and Sophia survived Ricardo, and thus each was entitled to $250,000 of the death benefit.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-23\">A policyowner also has the right to name a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-contingentbeneficiary\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-6\" role=\"doc-glossref\">contingent beneficiary</span> <em>, </em>a party who will receive the policy proceeds if the primary beneficiary dies before the insured. A contingent beneficiary, sometimes called a <em>secondary</em> or <em>successor beneficiary</em>, is entitled to the policy proceeds only if all designated primary beneficiaries have predeceased the insured. The policyowner may name more than one contingent beneficiary and may indicate how the insurer should divide the proceeds among the beneficiaries.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-11\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-24\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-12\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-25\">Ellen Wolfe purchased a $500,000 policy insuring her life. She named her husband, Donovan, as primary beneficiary and her children, Katherine, Louis, and Marten, as equal contingent beneficiaries. Only Katherine and Marten survived Ellen and, thus, they were each entitled to receive $250,000 of the policy death benefit.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-26\">Most insurers permit policyowners to designate additional levels of contingent beneficiaries. While this practice is uncommon, a policyowner may nominate a second-level contingent beneficiary who is entitled to policy proceeds only if the primary beneficiary and all first-level contingent beneficiaries die before the second-level contingent beneficiary. A second-level contingent beneficiary may also be called a <em>tertiary beneficiary </em>or a<em> final beneficiary</em>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-27\">The fact that a policyholder has designated an individual as a beneficiary does not obligate that individual to accept the proceeds. The named beneficiary may <em>disclaim</em> the proceeds, in which case the proceeds become payable as if the disclaiming beneficiary predeceased the policyholder. A beneficiary may disclaim policy proceeds for several reasons. For example, she may wish to avoid having the proceeds become a part of her taxable estate, prefer to have the payment made to the contingent beneficiary, or wish to insulate the proceeds from other debts she may have.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-28\">As we described in Chapter 10, the law may place the following limits on a policyowner’s right to name the beneficiary:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-4\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-21\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-29\">Minors lack contractual capacity and are limited in their right to purchase insurance. Most states permit minors of a stated age to enter into life insurance contracts if specific conditions are met, but many states limit a minor’s right to name the beneficiary by requiring that the beneficiary be the minor herself or one of her close family members, such as a parent or guardian. Therefore, a minor could purchase an insurance policy on the life of the minor’s parent or guardian and name herself as the beneficiary. This limitation is generally meant to ensure that the minor benefits from any life insurance policy he may own, and that the parties involved have clear insurable interest.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-22\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-30\">When a person purchases insurance on her own life, she generally may name anyone as beneficiary. Recall from Chapter 10 that when a person purchases insurance on <em>another</em> person’s life, the beneficiary generally must have an insurable interest in the insured’s life when the contract is formed.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-13\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-1\">Class Designations</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-31\">A policyowner may name a group of people as life insurance policy beneficiaries. A beneficiary designation that identifies a certain group of people, rather than naming each person individually, is called a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-classdesignation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-7\" role=\"doc-glossref\">class designation</span>. The designations “to my children,” “to my brothers and sisters,” and “to my grandchildren’ are class designations. Class members who survive the insured are entitled to share in the policy proceeds equally. The advantage to the policyowner of making a class designation is that the members of the class who will share in the policy proceeds are not determined until the policyowner dies. People who are born or adopted after the designation is made are automatically included as beneficiaries without the policyowner’s execution of a new beneficiary designation. The disadvantage of a class designation is that, before any proceeds are paid, the insurer must identify and locate all members of the beneficiary class. Locating all of the class members after the insured’s death may be difficult and, thus, could delay payment of the policy proceeds.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-14\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-32\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-15\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-33\">Alvin O’Connell named “my children” as the beneficiaries of a policy insuring his life. When he purchased the policy and named the beneficiaries, Mr. O’Connell had two daughters. Mr. O’Connell later divorced and remarried Anita Chang. He formally adopted Ms. Chang’s son from a previous marriage, and he and Ms. Chang had a daughter together. If all four children survive Mr. O’Connell, then they are each entitled to one-fourth of the policy proceeds. If only two children survive him, they are each entitled to one-half of the proceeds.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-34\">As the example illustrates, adopted children share in policy proceeds on the same basis as biological children. By contrast, a stepchild whom an insured did not legally adopt is not entitled to share in the policy proceeds under such a class designation. If Mr. O’Connell had not adopted his stepson, his stepson would not have been entitled to a share of the proceeds from the insurance policy on Mr. O’Connell’s life.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-35\">Class designations can be classified as either per capita designations (<em>per capita </em>meaning “by the head”) or per stirpes designations (<em>per stirpes</em> meaning “by the branch”). A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-percapitabeneficiarydesignation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">per capita beneficiary designation</span> is a class designation in which the class members all stand in the same relationship to the policyowner, and the class members who survive the insured share the policy proceeds equally. The designation described in the previous example is a per capita beneficiary designation. Only those children who survive the insured share the policy proceeds, and each survivor receives an equal share of the proceeds. No descendants or heirs of a deceased class member share in the distribution.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-36\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-perstirpesbeneficiarydesignation\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-9\" role=\"doc-glossref\">per stirpes beneficiary designation</span> is a class designation in which the descendants of a deceased class member take the decedent’s share of the policy proceeds by representation. We can describe a per stirpes designation as a method of dividing policy proceeds by family branches. A typical per stirpes beneficiary designation is stated as “to my children in equal shares with the share of any deceased child to the children of such child per stirpes.”</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-16\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-37\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-17\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-38\">Beatriz Mendoza owned a $600,000 policy on her life. She named as beneficiary her children in equal shares with the share of any deceased child to the children of such child per stirpes. Mrs. Mendoza had three children: Castel, Diego, and Esmeralda.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-39\">• First, assume that all three children survived Mrs. Mendoza. Because she was survived by three family branches, each child is entitled to one-third of the policy proceeds ($200,000).</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-40\">• Second, assume that Mrs. Mendoza was survived only by Castel herself and Esmeralda’s two children. Because she was survived by two family branches, each branch is entitled to half of the policy proceeds. Castel receives half ($300,000), and Esmeralda’s two children share the other half of the proceeds equally ($150,000 each).</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-41\">• Finally, assume that Mrs. Mendoza outlived all of her children. She was survived in this situation by (1) Castel’s two children, (2) Diego’s child, and (3) Esmeralda’s four children. Because she was survived by three family branches, each branch is entitled to one-third of the policy proceeds. Castel’s two children share one-third equally ($100,000 each); Diego’s child is entitled to one-third ($200,000), and Esmeralda’s four children share one-third equally ($50,000 each).</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-42\">Figure 11.1 illustrates how a per capita designation differs from a per stirpes designation.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:755px;\" id=\"figure11-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-43\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-10\">Figure 11.1</span> Comparison of Per Capita and Per Stirpes</p> <img alt=\"Comparison of Per Capita and Per Stirpes\" id=\"loma311-ch11-img-18\" src=\"../../imgs/11-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-18\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure11-1\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-11\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-19\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure11-1\" id=\"loma311-ch11-a-8\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 11-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-20\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-2\">Changing the Beneficiary</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-44\">A life insurance policy typically gives the policyowner the contractual right to change a policy’s beneficiary designation whenever he wants, but only during the lifetime of the insured. When a policyowner names a new beneficiary, the prior beneficiary’s right to receive the policy proceeds is revoked. As we saw in Chapter 9, a beneficiary designation is revocable if the policyowner has the unrestricted right to change the designation during the insured’s lifetime; such a beneficiary is known as a <em>revocable beneficiary</em>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-45\">A revocable beneficiary’s interest in life insurance policy proceeds vests when the insured dies. Until that time, a revocable beneficiary generally has neither a legal interest in the proceeds nor any involvement with the policy. During the insured’s lifetime,</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-5\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-23\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-46\">A revocable beneficiary cannot make a claim against any policy values.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-24\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-47\">A revocable beneficiary usually cannot prohibit the policyowner from exercising any policy ownership rights.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-48\">Thus, during the insured’s lifetime, a revocable beneficiary’s interest in the life insurance policy is said to be a <em>mere expectancy</em>. Although a revocable beneficiary expects to receive the policy proceeds following the insured’s death, that expectation may not be met because the policyowner may change the beneficiary designation without obtaining the beneficiary’s consent.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-21\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-3\">Limitations on Beneficiary Changes</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-49\">A beneficiary designation generally is considered to be revocable unless the policyowner voluntarily gives up the right to change the beneficiary. A policyowner gives up the right to change the beneficiary when she designates the beneficiary as an irrevocable beneficiary. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-irrevocablebeneficiary\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-12\" role=\"doc-glossref\">irrevocable beneficiary</span> is a beneficiary whose rights to policy proceeds are vested when the beneficiary designation is made. An irrevocable beneficiary’s vested interest in the policy proceeds usually continues as long as the policy remains in force or until the beneficiary (1) consents in writing to a change of beneficiary or (2) predeceases the insured. In many divorce cases, one spouse is required either to purchase a life insurance policy and make the other spouse an irrevocable beneficiary or to name the other spouse as the irrevocable beneficiary of an existing insurance policy. An irrevocable beneficiary designation may also be required if the policyowner assigns ownership of the policy to another party; we discuss assignments in more detail in the next chapter.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-22\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-50\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-23\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-51\">Irene Kazadi purchased an insurance policy on her life and named her husband, Garland, as the irrevocable beneficiary. She named her children as revocable contingent beneficiaries. After Irene and Garland divorced, Garland would not consent to Irene’s request to change the beneficiary; thus he remained the irrevocable beneficiary. Ten years later, Garland died and his vested interest in the policy was extinguished. Irene then had the right to name another primary beneficiary as either a revocable or irrevocable beneficiary.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-52\">Because an irrevocable beneficiary has a vested interest in the policy proceeds, policies typically limit some of the policyowner’s rights to make changes that affect the policy values unless the irrevocable beneficiary consents in writing. For example, a policyowner typically cannot obtain a policy loan or surrender the policy for cash without the irrevocable beneficiary’s consent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-53\">To make an effective beneficiary change, a policyowner must have legal capacity. In addition, an irrevocable beneficiary must have the legal capacity to consent to a beneficiary change for the change to be effective. A person generally has the required legal capacity if she has attained the age of majority—18 in most states—and is mentally competent. Whether a person is mentally competent is a question of fact that depends on whether the person understood what he was doing at the time. The question of whether a person was mentally competent to make a beneficiary change typically arises when an earlier-named beneficiary claims the policy proceeds and alleges that a later beneficiary designation was ineffective because the policyowner was incompetent at the time. A party to a lawsuit who alleges that a person was not mentally competent to make a beneficiary change or to agree to such a change has the burden of proving that fact.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-54\">A minor does not have the legal capacity to consent to a policyowner’s exercising her rights under a life insurance policy. As a result, if an irrevocable beneficiary has not attained the age of majority, the policyowner cannot obtain the beneficiary’s consent to any policy transaction. Furthermore, a minor’s guardian typically cannot consent on the minor’s behalf. The guardian has a duty to protect the interests of the minor and, thus, usually cannot consent to a transaction that would reduce the minor’s interest in a policy. Therefore, when a policyowner designates a minor as an irrevocable beneficiary, the policyowner is generally unable to interact with the policy in any way that would require the beneficiary’s consent until the beneficiary reaches the age of majority and gives consent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-55\">In most states, the divorce of a married couple does not automatically affect their rights in a life insurance policy. For example, assume that at the time of their divorce, a man owned a policy on his life and the wife was the revocable beneficiary. The fact of the divorce does not affect the husband’s ownership of the policy, and the wife remains the beneficiary until the husband changes the beneficiary designation. In granting a couple a divorce, however, the court may include an order that one party keep a life insurance policy in force and keep the former spouse as the irrevocable beneficiary. Usually a court includes such an order as part of an alimony or child support arrangement, so that the beneficiary or children will continue to be provided for in the event of the insured’s death.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-56\">Laws in some places impose different limitations on beneficiary designations than the general U.S. rules described here. For example, in the Canadian province of Quebec,</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-25\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-57\">The designation of a policyowner’s spouse is presumed to be an irrevocable designation unless the policyowner specifically makes the designation revocable. <span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-13\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch11-en1\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-14\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</span> </span> </p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-26\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-58\">The divorce or annulment of a marriage extinguishes the designation of the former spouse as irrevocable beneficiary.<span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-15\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch11-en2\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-16\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</span> </span> </p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-24\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-4\">Methods of Beneficiary Changes</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-59\">If a policyowner has retained the right to change the beneficiary, the procedure to make such a change is straightforward. To make an effective change of beneficiary, a policyowner must comply with any contractual requirement found in the insurance policy. Most policies issued today specify the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-recordingmethod\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-17\" role=\"doc-glossref\">recording method</span>for a beneficiary change, under which the policyowner must provide the insurer with a written and signed notification of the beneficiary change. After the insurer receives the notification, the insurer updates its policy to reflect the name of the new beneficiary. Some insurers also require a change of beneficiary request to be signed by disinterested witnesses. An increasing number of insurers offer policyowners the option of changing a beneficiary electronically, for instance through email or by the use of electronic forms hosted on the insurer’s website. In such cases, an electronic signature is considered sufficient. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-60\">Some older life insurance policies specify the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-endorsementmethod\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-18\" role=\"doc-glossref\">endorsement method</span> for changing the beneficiary, under which the policyowner must submit his policy to the insurer along with a beneficiary change request. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-endorsement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-19\" role=\"doc-glossref\">endorsement</span> is a document that is attached to a life insurance policy and that becomes part of the insurance contract. The insurer adds the endorsement specifying the name of the new beneficiary and returns the policy to the policyowner.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-61\">As noted, a policyowner must comply with the beneficiary change method required by his policy to make an effective change. Courts in most states, however, allow an exception to this general rule under the equitable doctrine of substantial compliance. According to the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-doctrineofsubstantialcompliance\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-20\" role=\"doc-glossref\">doctrine of substantial compliance</span>, when a policyowner has done everything possible to comply with the beneficiary change procedure set forth in the policy, but has failed because of circumstances beyond his control, the change will be considered effective.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-25\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-62\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-26\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-63\">Chanda Soun owned an insurance policy on her life and wanted to change the beneficiary from her brother to her daughter. Her policy stated the recording method for making a beneficiary change. As required by the policy, Ms. Soun completed a signed notification of the desired beneficiary change and mailed it to the insurer. The written notification was delayed in the mail because of bad weather, and Ms. Soun died several days before the insurer received and processed the beneficiary change. Ms. Soun’s brother and her daughter both claimed the policy proceeds. Courts in states that apply the doctrine of substantial compliance are likely to find the beneficiary change to be effective because Ms. Soun did everything she could to change the beneficiary before her death. Thus, the policy proceeds would be payable to Ms. Soun’s daughter.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-64\">A court applies the doctrine of substantial compliance only if it is clear that the policyowner intended to change the beneficiary, and the court considers all of the surrounding circumstances to determine the policyowner’s intent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-65\">If a life insurance policy does not specify a method for changing the named beneficiary, then any method the policyowner uses to change the beneficiary is effective as long as the method selected clearly indicates the policyowner’s intent to change the beneficiary. In such cases, some states even permit a policyowner to make an effective beneficiary change by means of the policyowner’s will.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-27\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-5\">Death of the Beneficiary</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-66\">If the primary and all contingent beneficiaries predecease the insured, then the policy proceeds are payable to the policyowner, if she is alive; otherwise, the proceeds usually are payable to the policyowner’s estate.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-67\">A beneficiary sometimes survives the insured but dies before the insurer has paid the policy proceeds. In such a case, the insurer pays the proceeds in accordance with the terms of the policy and the beneficiary designation. Some policies contain a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-survivorshipclause\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-21\" role=\"doc-glossref\">survivorship clause</span> or <em>time clause</em> that requires the beneficiary to survive the insured for a stated number of days to be entitled to the policy proceeds. A policyowner also has the right to require that the beneficiary survive the insured by a specified amount of time in order to receive the policy proceeds.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-28\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-68\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-29\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-69\">Mamoun Harrak owned two insurance policies on his life. The beneficiary designation of a $750,000 policy was “to my wife, Jahina Harrak, if living on the thirtieth day after the death of the insured; otherwise to my daughter, Namira Harrak.” The beneficiary designation of a $100,000 policy was “to my wife, Jahina Harrak.” Mamoun’s brother, Bachir, was the contingent beneficiary of the second policy. Mamoun and Jahina were involved in an automobile accident. Mamoun died instantly. Jahina died three days later.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-70\">Because Jahina did not survive Mamoun by 30 days, the proceeds of the $750,000 policy with the survivorship clause are payable to Namira as the contingent beneficiary. Because Jahina did survive Mamoun, the proceeds of the $100,000 policy with no survivorship clause are payable to Jahina’s estate.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-30\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-6\">Designation of the Policyowner’s Estate</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-71\">As noted, a policyowner-insured may make life insurance policy proceeds payable to his own estate. The designation of a policyowner’s estate is always considered to be a revocable beneficiary designation. The policyowner has the right to change such a beneficiary designation at any time during the insured’s life.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-72\">When policy proceeds are payable to an estate, the decedent’s personal representative is responsible for distributing the proceeds in accordance with</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-27\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-73\">The terms of the decedent’s will, <em>or</em> </p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-28\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-74\">The provisions of the applicable intestate succession laws, as discussed in Chapter 6</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-75\">Policy proceeds that are paid to a decedent’s estate become part of the decedent’s probate estate and therefore become subject to claims of the decedent’s creditors. In such a case, the policyowner-insured’s wishes might not be met: the people whom he wanted to receive the policy proceeds may not in fact receive the money. In addition, taxes and other estate expenses may reduce the amount the decedent’s heirs ultimately receive. By contrast, life insurance policy proceeds that are paid to a named beneficiary pass outside a decedent’s will and do not become part of the decedent’s probate estate. A policyowner can seek to ensure that policy proceeds are paid to a named beneficiary rather than to her estate by naming several levels of contingent beneficiaries.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-2-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-2\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-76\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch11-img-19\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-2-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-77\">At the time of her death, Daphne Christou owned a $300,000 insurance policy on her own life.

This promise is a conditional promise; the death benefit is payable only if the policy is in force at the insured’s death. A policyowner must pay policy premiums as they come due to keep a policy in force.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-89\">Whether a premium was paid when due is a question of fact. The burden of proof concerning this fact rests on the party who claims that the premium was paid. For example, assume an insurer denied a claim for policy proceeds on the grounds that the policy was not in force when the insured died. The claimant to the policy proceeds sued the insurer claiming that premiums were paid when due and, thus, the policy was in force at the insured’s death. The claimant has the burden to prove that premiums were paid when due, such as by providing records of the relevant bank transactions.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-42\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-7\">Initial Premium</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-90\">An applicant for life insurance pays a consideration in exchange for the insurer’s contractual promise; the initial premium forms part of this consideration. The insurance contract does not take effect until the essential part of the consideration is paid. Typically, an applicant pays the initial premium when she completes the application for insurance. If the parties do not enter into a life insurance contract, the insurer must refund the premium to the applicant. Likewise, if a policyowner rejects a life insurance contract during the contract’s free look period, the insurer must return the initial premium to the policyowner. Recall from Chapter 10 that the insurance policy and the coverage it provides are effective during the free look period.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-43\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-8\">Renewal Premiums</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-91\">Individual life insurance policies state the dates on which renewal premiums are due. We use the term <em>renewal premiums</em> to refer to all premiums payable after the initial premium. Although the policyowner must pay a renewal premium when due to keep a policy in force, the policyowner has no legal obligation to pay a renewal premium; recall that life insurance contracts are unilateral contracts. Thus, policyowners have the right to discontinue premium payments at any time without incurring liability to the insurer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-92\">As we saw in Chapter 8, state laws require life insurance policies to include a <em>grace period provision</em>, which allows a policyowner to pay a renewal premium within a stated time following a premium due date. For term and whole life policies, the grace period usually is 31 days; universal life policies usually include a 61-day grace period. Life insurance coverage continues in force throughout the policy’s grace period, regardless of whether the premium is ever paid. If the insured dies during the grace period but before the premium is paid, the insurer is obligated to pay the policy proceeds. The insurer, however, is entitled to deduct the amount of the unpaid premium from the policy proceeds before paying those proceeds.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-93\">The grace period begins on the day following a premium due date. For example, if a premium that is due on April 1 is unpaid on that date, then April 2 is the first day of the policy’s grace period. If the policy provides a 31-day grace period, then the last day of the grace period is May 2. The insurer must receive payment no later than midnight of the last day of the grace period in order for that premium to be considered paid when due. However, if the last day of the grace period falls on a nonbusiness day, such as a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, then the premium can be paid on the next business day. See Figure 11.2 for an illustration of the grace period.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:771px;\" id=\"figure11-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-94\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-29\">Figure 11.2</span> The Grace Period</p> <img alt=\"The Grace Period\" id=\"loma311-ch11-img-43\" src=\"../../imgs/11-2figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-44\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure11-2\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-30\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-45\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure11-2\" id=\"loma311-ch11-a-11\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 11-2 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-46\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-9\">Premium Payment Methods</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-95\">An insurer has the right to incorporate into a policy any reasonable terms the company wants concerning the method of premium payment. For example, an insurer can agree to accept payment by cash, check, electronic transaction, promissory note, money order, or any other method it chooses.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-29\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-96\"><strong>Payment by personal check.</strong> If a policyowner pays a premium by mailing a personal check to the insurer, the premium is not considered paid until the insurer receives the check. If the bank does not honor the check due to insufficient funds, the premium has not been paid. When a check is dishonored and the grace period has expired, an insurer may (1) lapse the policy for nonpayment of premium, or (2) try to collect on the dishonored check. In either case, an insurer must act promptly. If a court finds that an insurer unreasonably delayed in acting when a check is dishonored, the court is likely to find that the insured waived its right to lapse the policy for nonpayment of premium.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-30\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-97\"><strong>Electronic payments.</strong> In recent years, many insurers have moved to accept electronic premium payments. The policyowner usually has the choice of either paying online through a credit card or arranging an electronic deduction directly from the policyowner’s bank account. Typically these insurers also offer autopay options in which the policyowner can arrange for these payments to be made automatically on a regular schedule, such as charging the premium payment to the policyowner’s credit card at the start of the month. If a policyowner’s bank account or credit card does not have sufficient funds to make the payment, the insurer may lapse the policy for nonpayment of premium. However, in this case typically the insurer notifies the policyowner that the premium was not paid and allows a grace period for the policyowner to arrange payment.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-31\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-98\"><strong>Policy dividends.</strong> State insurance laws generally prohibit an insurer from lapsing a policy for nonpayment of premium if the insurer has policy dividends on deposit sufficient to pay a renewal premium. However, the insurer must apply policy dividends to pay a renewal premium only if (1) the amount of dividends the insurer has on deposit is large enough to cover the full amount of the renewal premium that is due, and (2) the policyowner has not chosen another policy dividend option. The policyowner has the contractual right to select one of the dividend options specified in her policy. Typically, a policyowner selects an option when she completes the application for insurance, but she may change the option at any time during the life of the policy. However, to change to the additional term insurance option, the policyowner usually is required to provide the insurer with evidence of the insured’s insurability. Policies also specify an automatic dividend option that the insurer will apply if the policyowner for some reason does not choose a dividend option.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-47\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-10\">Who May Pay the Premium</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-99\">Insurers typically accept payment of a premium from anyone who tenders the payment. For instance, a beneficiary may pay a premium to keep the policy in force and to protect her own interest in the policy. However, payment of a premium by a beneficiary generally does not give the beneficiary any contractual rights in the policy.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-48\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-100\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-49\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-101\">A revocable beneficiary voluntarily paid a number of premiums for the policyowner, who later changed the beneficiary designation. Even though the original beneficiary paid premiums, she has no right to receive any part of the policy proceeds.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-50\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-11\">Premium Notices</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-102\">Policyowners who do not receive premium notices may not remember to pay premiums when they are due. Advances in technology allow insurers to offer automatic payment options to policyholders as one solution to this problem. Even if the policyowner forgets that a premium is due, the policyowner’s bank or credit card automatically processes the premium payment on time.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-103\">To help policyowners who are not enrolled in automatic payment plans, insurers generally send premium due notices to all policyowners. These notices may take multiple forms, such as physical mail or electronic messages. However, insurers are not generally legally obligated to send premium due notices to life insurance policyowners unless a statute requires them to do so. Some states have enacted statutes requiring insurers to send premium due notices, and those states limit an insurer’s right to lapse a policy for nonpayment of premium if the insurer fails to send a premium due notice to the policyowner as the statute requires. Some states have laws requiring insurers to permit older policyowners to designate a third party to whom the insurer must send copies of notices, including of cancellation, nonrenewal, and conditional renewal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-104\">When an insurer has established a pattern of sending premium notices over a period of time, courts in most states limit the insurer’s right to lapse a policy for nonpayment of premium if the insurer stops sending premium due notices and does not notify the policyowner that it will no longer send notices.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-105\">Courts reach this result using a doctrine known as estoppel. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-estoppel\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Estoppel</span> is an equitable doctrine by which someone is restrained—or estopped—from acting in a manner that contradicts her previous conduct. Estoppel is invoked when (1) one party’s conduct has misled an innocent party and (2) inconsistent actions by the first party would harm the innocent party. The following elements typically are necessary to create an estoppel:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-32\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-106\">The first party has knowledge of the facts but communicates something in a misleading way, either by words, conduct, or silence.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-33\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-107\">The second party does not have knowledge of the facts and reasonably relies on the first party’s words, conduct, or silence.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-34\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-108\">The second party would be harmed if the first party were allowed to assert a claim that is inconsistent with his early words, conduct, or silence.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-51\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-109\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-52\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-110\">An insurer consistently sent quarterly premium due notices to a policyowner for many years, but due to an administrative error, failed to send one notice. The policyowner-insured did not pay that renewal premium and died shortly after the end of the policy grace period. The insurer denied the beneficiary’s claim on the ground that the policy had lapsed for nonpayment of premium. Courts in most states would find in favor of the beneficiary and would require the insurer to pay the policy proceeds, less the amount of the unpaid premium.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-111\">Estoppel is based on a moral principle that seeks to prevent an injustice to an innocent party. In the previous example, it would be unfair to allow the insurer to avoid its liability under the policy because it had led the policyowner-insured to believe that he would receive a premium notice. When an insurer has established a pattern of sending premium due notices, the insurer has the legal right to stop sending such notices only if it notifies policyowners that it will no longer send such notices.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-112\">Insurers also have a duty to send premium due notices to policyowners when the policyowners would not otherwise know the amount of the premium that is due. For example, the owner of a flexible-premium policy may not know the amount of premium required to keep the policy in force.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-53\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-12\">Late Payment Offers</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-113\">Although insurers have the right to require timely payment of premiums, they sometimes extend a late payment offer to a policyowner who has not paid a premium by the end of the grace period, when the policy ends. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-latepaymentoffer\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">late payment offer</span>is an insurer’s conditional offer to waive its right to require timely payment of a premium. The policyowner can accept the insurer’s offer by paying the overdue premium within the time specified in the insurer’s offer—usually 30 to 90 days after the end of the grace period. Late payment offers typically require that the policyowner pay the unpaid premium during the lifetime of the insured. Upon receipt of the premium during the specified time, the insurer must put the policy back into force. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-114\">By extending a late payment offer, an insurer does not extend the policy’s grace period. Instead, the insurer has offered to waive its right to require timely payment. The insurer does not actually waive that right until the policyowner meets the terms of the conditional offer. A late payment offer applies only to the then unpaid renewal premium; the offer does not include a waiver of the insurer’s right to require timely payment of future premiums.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-4-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-4\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-115\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch11-img-44\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-4-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-116\">Chelsea Seng owns a universal life policy with a grace period provision.

When a premium is unpaid for a policy that provides no cash value, the policy terminates without value; that is, the policy and coverage under the policy terminate.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-128\">In contrast, insurance laws in all states require insurers to provide a cash surrender value after a cash value life insurance policy has been in force for a specified minimum time, typically three years. The states also impose requirements as to how insurers must calculate a policy’s minimum cash surrender value. The nonforfeiture provision usually gives the policyowner the right to select from among several nonforfeiture options if a premium is unpaid when the grace period ends. Most policies provide three types of nonforfeiture benefits: a cash surrender option, continued insurance coverage benefits, and an automatic nonforfeiture benefit.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-71\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-13\">Cash Surrender</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-129\">The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-cashsurrendervaluenonforfeitureoption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-43\" role=\"doc-glossref\">cash surrender value nonforfeiture option</span> or <em>cash payment nonforfeiture option</em> permits a policyowner to discontinue premium payments, surrender the policy and receive the policy’s cash surrender value in a lump-sum payment. When the policyowner surrenders a policy, the life insurance contract and all coverage under the contract terminate. The parties have no further contractual rights or obligations. If the beneficiary is an irrevocable beneficiary, the policyowner must obtain the beneficiary’s consent to surrender the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-130\">The amount of cash value actually available to a policyowner upon surrender of the policy may not be the exact cash surrender value amount described in the policy. The amount of a life insurance policy’s cash value that the policy will receive upon surrendering the policy is called the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-netcashsurrendervalue\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-44\" role=\"doc-glossref\">net cash surrender value</span>. The net cash surrender value is calculated by adjusting the cash surrender value for amounts such as dividend additions, advance premium payments, policy loans (including unpaid interest), and policy withdrawals. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-dividendadditions\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-45\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Dividend additions</span>, also known as <em>paid-up additions</em>, are additional amounts of insurance purchased using policy dividends. Because dividend additions represent paid-up insurance, they also have cash values that the policyowner can collect upon surrender of the policy. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-131\">The laws of most states require life insurance policies to include a provision that gives the insurer the right to defer payment of the policy’s cash surrender value for up to six months after the request for payment is made. This right to defer payment is designed to relieve the pressure on the insurer’s cash reserves in the unlikely event of a rush of surrenders occurring over a short period, such as in a catastrophic event. Insurers rarely invoke this right.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-72\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-14\">Continued Insurance Coverage Benefits</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-132\">Many cash value policies give the policyowner the option of discontinuing premium payments and continuing insurance coverage as either reduced paid-up insurance or extended term insurance.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-133\">Under the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-reducedpaidupinsurancenonforfeitureoption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">reduced paid-up insurance nonforfeiture option</span>, the net cash value of the policy is used as a net single premium to purchase paid-up life insurance of the same plan as the original policy. The insurer bases the premium charged for the paid-up insurance on the age the insured has attained when the option is exercised. The amount of paid-up insurance that the policyowner can purchase under this option is smaller than the face amount of the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-134\">The coverage issued under this option continues to have and to build a cash value. In addition, the policyowner continues to have the rights available to the owner of any life insurance policy, including the right to surrender the policy for its cash value and the right to receive policy dividends if the original policy was issued on a participating basis.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-135\">Under the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-extendedterminsurancenonforfeitureoption\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">extended term insurance nonforfeiture option</span>, the policy’s net cash value is used as a net single premium to purchase term insurance for the full face amount provided under the original policy—less the amount of any outstanding policy loans and unpaid interest—for as long a term as that net cash value can provide. The length of the term for which coverage is provided depends on the amount of the coverage, the amount of the net cash surrender value, and the insured’s attained age when the option is exercised. In most states, the length of the term also depends on the sex of the insured. A policy providing this nonforfeiture option usually includes a schedule that shows the length of time the original face amount of the policy will be continued in force under the extended term option for each of the first 20 policy years.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-136\">Most policies specify that, when the policy is continued on an extended term insurance basis, the policyowner cannot exercise the policy loan privilege or receive policy dividends.

Note that the automatic benefit becomes effective only if the policyowner has not elected another nonforfeiture option.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-138\">Policies typically state that the automatic nonforfeiture benefit is either the extended term or reduced paid-up insurance benefit described earlier or an automatic premium loan benefit. Under an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-automaticpremiumloanbenefit\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-49\" role=\"doc-glossref\">automatic premium loan (APL) benefit</span>, the insurer automatically pays an overdue premium by making a loan against the policy’s cash value if the cash value equals or exceeds the amount of the premium due. The use of the automatic premium loan keeps the policy in force for the full amount of coverage. Once the APL benefit becomes effective, the policy remains in force until all funds held by the insurer in connection with the policy have been used.

The <em>policy loan provision</em> gives the policyowner the right to take out a loan for an amount that does not exceed the policy’s cash value less one year’s interest on the loan. As with cash surrenders, laws in most states permit insurers to defer granting policy loans—except for loans made for the purposes of paying premiums—for a specified period, usually up to six months. This deferral option, which insurers rarely enforce, is intended to protect insurers from suffering significant financial losses if large numbers of policyowners request policy loans.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-146\">A policy loan differs from a commercial loan in that a policyowner is not legally obligated to repay a policy loan, although the policyowner has the right to repay part or all of the loan any time during the lifetime of the insured. If a policy loan has not been repaid when the insured dies, the insurer deducts the amount of the unpaid loan plus interest from the policy benefit that is payable. Similarly, if a policy loan is not repaid when the policyowner surrenders the policy for its cash value, the insurer deducts the amount of the unpaid loan and interest from the cash value paid to the policyowner. In contrast, a commercial loan creates a debtor-creditor relationship between the borrower and the lender. The borrower is legally obligated to repay the loan, and if he does not, the lender may seek the help of the courts to recover the debt.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-147\">Insurers charge interest on each policy loan, usually on an annual basis. Any unpaid interest charges become part of the policy loan. If the amount of a policy loan plus unpaid interest increases to the point at which the total indebtedness is greater than the amount of the policy’s cash value, the policy terminates without further value. An insurer must notify a policyowner at least 30 days in advance of such a policy terminating. Such a notification gives the policyowner the chance to repay part or all of the loan to avoid the policy’s termination.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-148\">Some life insurance policies include a provision that allows for direct withdrawals rather than loans. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-policywithdrawalprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-55\" role=\"doc-glossref\">policy withdrawal provision</span>, or <em>partial surrender provision</em>, permits the policyowner to make withdrawals from the cash value. Because the amount of benefit payments to be made under such policies depends on the amount of the cash value, some policies specify that a withdrawal also reduces the benefit payment amounts. For example, universal life policies sometimes provide that a withdrawal reduces both the cash value and the face amount (death benefit) of the policy by the amount of the withdrawal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-149\">Policies usually place limits on the amount that may be withdrawn and on the number of withdrawals that are permitted each year. Many policies also impose a fee on each withdrawal, but policies typically do not impose interest charges on withdrawals. Most policies do not allow a policyowner to repay a withdrawal; the reduction in the amount of the death benefit payable as a result of a withdrawal is permanent. The table below summarizes the differences between policy loans and policy withdrawals.</p> <table class=\"striped blue\" id=\"loma311-ch11-table-1\"> <tbody> <tr> <th colspan=\"4\" id=\"loma311-ch11-td-1\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-150\"><strong>Policy Loans and Withdrawals</strong> </p> </th> </tr> <tr> <th id=\"loma311-ch11-td-2\">&#160;</th> <th id=\"loma311-ch11-td-3\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-151\"><em>Repayable?</em> </p> </th> <th id=\"loma311-ch11-td-4\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-152\"><em>Affect Benefit Payments?</em> </p> </th> <th id=\"loma311-ch11-td-5\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-153\"><em>Cash Value Accumulation Required?</em> </p> </th> </tr> <tr> <th id=\"loma311-ch11-td-6\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-154\"><strong>Loan</strong> </p> </th> <td id=\"loma311-ch11-td-7\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-155\">Yes</p> </td> <td id=\"loma311-ch11-td-8\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-156\">Not if repaid</p> </td> <td id=\"loma311-ch11-td-9\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-157\">Yes</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <th id=\"loma311-ch11-td-10\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-158\"><strong>Withdrawal</strong> </p> </th> <td id=\"loma311-ch11-td-11\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-159\">No</p> </td> <td id=\"loma311-ch11-td-12\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-160\">Yes</p> </td> <td id=\"loma311-ch11-td-13\"> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-161\">Yes</p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-83\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch11-h3-5\">Accelerated Death Benefits</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-162\">Some individual life policies allow the policyowner to receive a portion of the policy proceeds, rather than the cash value, before the death of the insured.

Most insurers do not permit reinstatement if the owner has surrendered the policy for its cash value.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-187\">Most states require individual life insurance policies to include a reinstatement provision. Laws in these states require policies to provide at least a three-year period during which the policyowner may reinstate a policy that has lapsed. Most U.S. insurers include a reinstatement provision in all individual life insurance policies as a matter of practice. Some insurers also provide a reinstatement period that is longer than the required three-year period. Insurers are free to include provisions that are more favorable to policyowners than are those required by law.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-101\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-16\">Reinstatement Requirements</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-188\">To reinstate a policy, a policyowner must meet certain conditions, which are spelled out in the policy. Reinstatement provisions typically require the policyowner to</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch11-ul-12\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-45\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-189\">Complete a reinstatement application within the time frame stated in the reinstatement provision</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-46\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-190\">Provide the insurer with satisfactory evidence of the insured’s continued insurability. Insurers will sometimes waive this requirement under certain conditions. For example, if a policy lapsed less than six months prior to the insurer receiving the reinstatement application, the insurer may waive this requirement.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-47\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-191\">Pay a specified amount of money; the amount required depends on the type of policy being reinstated. For a fixed-premium policy, the policyowner must pay all unpaid back premiums plus interest on those premiums. For a flexible-premium policy, the policyowner must pay an amount sufficient to cover the policy’s mortality and expense charges for at least two months. Some flexible-premium policies also require the policyowner to pay mortality and expense charges for the period between the date of lapse and the date of reinstatement.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch11-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch11-p-192\">Pay any outstanding policy loan or have the policy loan reinstated when the policy is reinstated.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch11-div-102\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch11-h4-17\">Effect of Reinstatement</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-193\">When a policy is reinstated, the original policy is put back into full force and effect as if it had never lapsed; no new policy is issued. The beneficiary designated to receive the policy proceeds remains the beneficiary. If the beneficiary was designated irrevocably, the designation remains irrevocable. Typically, to protect the insurer against antiselection, a new contestable period begins on the date the policy was reinstated. The length of the new contestable period is the same as the original contestable period provided by the policy. However, the new contestable period applies only to statements made in the reinstatement application. Misrepresentations in the original application are contestable only if the original contestable period has not expired. Regulation generally does not permit insurers to impose a new suicide exclusion period when a policy is reinstated. We describe the contestable period in Chapter 13.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-9-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"ms\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-9\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-194\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch11-img-134\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-9-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-195\">Which of the following actions must a policyowner typically take in order for an insurer to reinstate a policy?

Like a life insurance policy, an annuity contract is intangible personal property that consists of a bundle of property rights. Most of those property rights vest in the contract owner when the contract is issued. The specific rights that a contract owner has depend on the terms of the annuity contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-202\">The owner of an annuity has the right to designate the payee who will receive the periodic income payments. The owner also has the right to decide when those payments will begin. Annuities include a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch11-gt-payoutoptionsprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch11-span-70\" role=\"doc-glossref\">payout options provision</span> or <em>settlement options provision</em> that identifies each of the payout options from which the contract owner may select.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-203\">The owner of a deferred annuity has additional ownership rights that exist during the contract’s accumulation period. State insurance laws require deferred annuities to provide nonforfeiture values. During the accumulation period, the contract owner has the right to withdraw all or part of the annuity’s accumulated value. The contract owner also has the right to surrender the annuity for its cash surrender value.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-204\">Deferred annuities typically provide a death benefit, known as a <em>survivor benefit</em>, that is payable to a beneficiary named by the contract owner. The survivor benefit is a determinable amount that is payable if the contract owner dies during the contract’s accumulation period. Unless the beneficiary is an irrevocable beneficiary, the contract owner has the right to change the beneficiary designation at any time during the accumulation period. At the contract’s maturity date, survivor benefits are no longer payable, and any rights the designated beneficiary had in the contract end.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-205\">The owner of an annuity may have the right to transfer ownership of the contract by means of an assignment. Whether the contract owner has that right depends on whether the annuity qualifies as an individual retirement arrangement. As we saw in Chapter 7, an <em>individual retirement arrangement (IRA)</em> is a retirement savings plan that allows individuals with taxable compensation to deposit a stated amount of that income into a savings arrangement that meets certain requirements specified in the federal tax laws and, thus, receives favorable tax treatment. An individual retirement arrangement may take one of two forms: an individual retirement account, or an individual retirement annuity.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch11-p-206\">To satisfy federal tax law requirements, an individual retirement annuity must be nontransferable by the contract owner. Thus, the contract owner cannot assign her interest in the contract, and individual retirement annuity contracts must contain a provision that spells out this limitation. We describe assignments in Chapter 12.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch11-question-10-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\"

She may transfer some of these rights by assignment or by means of a policy’s change of ownership provision. The owner of an annuity can also transfer ownership of his rights in the annuity; we discuss annuity assignments further in Chapter 14.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-10\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-1\">Assignments</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-22\">In general, the owner of any personal property may give away or sell his ownership rights in the property by assigning the rights to another. Similarly, a property owner can, by means of an assignment, pledge his rights in personal property as security for a debt.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-23\">Two methods of transferring life insurance policy ownership rights during the lifetime of the insured are through an absolute assignment and a collateral assignment. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-absoluteassignment\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-4\" role=\"doc-glossref\">absolute assignment</span> is the irrevocable transfer to another of all of a policyowner’s ownership rights in a life insurance policy.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-11\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-24\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-12\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-25\">Edward Yu bought an insurance policy on his daughter Cynthia’s life when she was four years old. When Cynthia reached age 21, Mr. Yu gave her the policy by absolutely assigning it to her.

A collateral assignment gives the assignee the right to share in the policy proceeds to the extent of the policyowner’s outstanding debt at the insured’s death. When a policyowner repays the debt owed to a collateral assignee during the lifetime of the insured, the assignee’s interest in the policy ends. All of the assignee’s interest in the policy then reverts to the policyowner.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-13\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-27\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-14\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-28\">Sonia Madsen owned a $125,000 insurance policy on her life. She collaterally assigned the policy to the Centurion Bank as security for a $50,000 loan. When Ms. Madsen died, she still owned the bank $20,000. Centurion will be entitled to receive $20,000 from the policy proceeds, and the remaining $105,000 is payable to the named beneficiary.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-15\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch12-h4-1\">Assignment Agreement</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-29\">General property law gives the property owner the right to assign property, including a life insurance policy. The owner assigns property by means of a contractual agreement that describes the rights and interests of the assignor and the assignee. An assignment of a life insurance policy is not required to be in writing unless a statute or the policy itself requires it. A written agreement better protects both parties, however, and is therefore common.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-30\">Under the terms of an <em>absolute assignment</em> of a life insurance policy, the assignee obtains all of the policyowner’s rights and interests in the policy; the absolute assignee thereby becomes the policyowner. The assignor has no further interest in the policy, and the assignee becomes responsible for premium payments. Also, the assignee is entitled to receive policy dividends (if applicable), as well as to surrender the policy or handle the policy as she wishes.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-31\">The terms of a <em>collateral assignment</em> usually restrict the policyowner from dealing with the policy in ways that would affect the collateral assignee’s interest. Collateral assignment agreements usually transfer to the assignee the right to:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch12-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-24\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-32\">Obtain a policy loan</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-25\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-33\">Surrender the policy for its cash surrender value</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-26\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-34\">Exercise nonforfeiture options</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-27\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-35\">Receive policy dividends</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-36\">In practice, assignees do not exercise these rights unless the assignor fails to repay the loan as required. Collateral assignments usually state that the policyowner retains the right to designate and change the policy beneficiary and the right to select a settlement option.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-37\">A collateral assignment agreement typically does not require the collateral assignee to pay the policy’s renewal premiums. If the assignee does pay such premiums, however, the assignee has the right to recover the amount paid from the policy proceeds. Thus, the amount of premiums the assignee pays is in effect added to the debt the policyowner owes the assignee.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-16\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-38\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-17\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-39\">Anula Kannangara owned a $500,000 insurance policy on her life. When Ms. Kannangara took out a $50,000 loan from Centurion Bank, she collaterally assigned her policy to the bank. At the time of her death, Ms. Kannangara owed $15,000 on the loan, and Centurion Bank had paid $2,500 in premiums on her policy. The bank is entitled to receive $17,500 of the policy proceeds, and the remainder of proceeds are payable to the named beneficiary.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-40\">According to conflict of laws rules, the validity and effect of an assignment agreement are governed by the laws of the state in which the assignment was made—that is, where the assignor signed the assignment agreement. As in the case of other contractual agreements, the parties to an assignment must have contractual capacity for the agreement to be valid and binding on the parties.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-41\">As discussed in Chapter 4, the parties to an assignment contract may include a choice of laws provision in the contract to decide which state’s laws govern their agreement. Life insurance policies, assignments, and other contracts usually specify which laws govern the agreement. If a contract does not specify which laws govern its execution, a court can apply conflict of laws rules.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-18\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch12-h4-2\">Beneficiary’s Rights</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-42\">When a policyowner assigns his life insurance policy, the rights of the policy beneficiary vary depending on the type of assignment and on whether the beneficiary is revocable or irrevocable.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-43\">When a policy that has a <em>revocable beneficiary</em> is absolutely assigned, courts’ decisions concerning the beneficiary designation vary. Some courts hold that the absolute assignment of a policy revokes the beneficiary designation. Other courts have found that the designation remains in effect, but the absolute assignee has the right to change the designation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-44\">Because a revocable beneficiary has no legal interest or involvement in a policy during the insured’s lifetime, the collateral assignee’s rights in the policy are superior to the beneficiary’s rights. Thus, the collateral assignee is entitled to be repaid from the policy proceeds even if the revocable beneficiary did not consent to the arrangement.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-45\">By comparison, an <em>irrevocable beneficiary</em>’s vested interest in a life insurance policy cannot be revoked without the beneficiary’s consent. According to the terms of most policies, when a beneficiary is designated irrevocably, the policyowner cannot transfer ownership of the policy without obtaining the beneficiary’s consent.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-46\">When a policy that has an irrevocable beneficiary is absolutely assigned, the beneficiary remains the irrevocable beneficiary unless she consents to a change of beneficiary. In addition, the assignee cannot take out a policy loan or surrender the policy for cash without the irrevocable beneficiary’s consent. The following insight shows two examples of a beneficiary’s rights in collateral assignments.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-19\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Beneficiary’s Rights in a Collateral Assignment\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch12-img-22\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-47\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-20\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-48\">Beneficiary’s Rights in a Collateral Assignment</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-49\"><strong>Example 1.</strong> Mitsumi Kayano owned a $120,000 policy insuring her life. Her husband was the irrevocable beneficiary. Ms. Kayano borrowed $20,000 from her brother, Jiro, and collaterally signed the policy to Jiro as security for the loan. A week later, Ms. Kayano died without having told her husband about the assignment.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-50\">Because Mr. Kayano was the policy’s irrevocable beneficiary, his vested interest in the policy proceeds could not be assigned without his consent. Mr. Kayano did not consent to the assignment, and thus the $120,000 policy proceeds are payable to Mr. Kayano.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-51\"><strong>Example 2.</strong> Karl Vogel purchased a $120,000 policy insuring his life and named his wife as the revocable beneficiary. He collaterally assigned the policy to Incipient Bank as security for a $40,000 loan without obtaining his wife’s consent. When Mr. Vogel died, he owed the bank $10,000.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-52\">Because Mrs. Vogel was the policy’s revocable beneficiary, her husband was not required to obtain her consent to the collateral assignment. As a result, Incipient Bank is entitled to receive $10,000 of the policy proceeds, and the remaining $110,000 is payable to Mrs. Vogel.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-21\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch12-h4-3\">Policy Provisions</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-53\">Because an owner’s right to assign her property is granted by general property law, an insurer is not required to give policyowners notice of their right to assign their policies. Most individual life insurance policies, however, do include an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-assignmentprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-6\" role=\"doc-glossref\">assignment provision</span>, which describes the roles of the insurer and the policyowner when the policy is assigned. Policies typically state that an assignment is not binding on the insurer unless the insurer is notified in writing of the assignment. Consider, for example, a situation in which a policyowner assigns the policy but does not provide written notice of this assignment to the insurer. If the insured dies, the insurer will pay the policy proceeds to the designated beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the policy. Because the insurer did not know of the assignment and paid the policy proceeds in good faith, the insurer would have no further liability under the policy, and the assignee will not be able to enforce a claim against the insurer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-54\">The typical assignment provision in individual life insurance policies states that the insurer is not responsible for verifying the validity of an assignment of the policy. The insurer is not a party to an assignment and has no control over the validity of such an agreement. If the insurer has received a valid written notice of an assignment, then the insurer usually presumes that the assignment is valid. The insurer typically cannot be held liable if it acts in good faith and in accordance with an assignment that is later declared invalid. In other words, if an insurer pays policy proceeds to an assignee who appears entitled to the proceeds, but the assignment is subsequently determined to be invalid, then the insurer cannot be required to pay the proceeds again to the person who was in fact entitled to them. However, if the insurer had knowledge of circumstances that should have made it question the validity of an assignment, then the insurer may be liable if it acts in accordance with an invalid assignment.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-55\">Assignment provisions also usually state that the rights of the insurer take precedence over the rights of an assignee with regard to the policy proceeds. Such a statement highlights the fact that an assignee cannot receive an amount greater than the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-netpolicyproceeds\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-7\" role=\"doc-glossref\">net policy proceeds</span>—that is, the amount of the proceeds remaining after any overdue premiums and any outstanding policy loans and interest have been deducted. An insurer is never obligated to pay any claimant an amount greater than the net policy proceeds, regardless of whether this fact is explained in the policy.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-22\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch12-h4-4\">Multiple Assignments</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-56\">A policyowner can assign a policy to more than one assignee. However, this practice inevitably raises questions as to which assignee is entitled to policy proceeds. To govern situations in which multiple assignees have notified the insurer of their assignments, the states have adopted two different rules—commonly known as the American rule and the English rule—to determine which assignee has a superior claim to the proceeds.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-23\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-57\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-24\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-58\">Samir Murad owned a $100,000 policy on his life. He assigned the policy to Hummingbird Bank as security for a $75,000 loan, and then later assigned the same policy to Butterfly Bank as security for a second $75,000 loan. Although both banks notified the insurer of their assignments, Butterfly notified the insurer before Hummingbird did. When Mr. Murad died he had not repaid either loan, and he owed each bank $70,000.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-59\">In states that follow what is known as the <em>American rule</em>, the <strong>first assignment </strong>has priority over a later assignment. In this example, Hummingbird Bank would have the superior claim and be entitled to $70,000 of the policy proceeds. The remaining $30,000 is payable to Butterfly Bank.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-60\">In states that follow what is known as the <em>English rule</em>, the <strong>first assignee to notify the insurer of its assignment </strong>has priority over other assignees. In this example, Butterfly would have the superior claim and be entitled to $70,000 of the policy proceeds. The remaining $30,000 is payable to Hummingbird.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-25\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-2\">Change of Ownership Provision</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-61\">Many individual life insurance policies issued in the United States include a provision that specifies a simple, direct method of transferring the policy’s ownership rights. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-changeofownershipprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-8\" role=\"doc-glossref\">change of ownership provision</span> permits a policyowner to transfer all operating rights by notifying the insurer in writing of the change, without having to enter into a separate assignment agreement. When the insurer records the ownership change in its files, the change generally becomes effective as of the date the policyowner signed the written notification.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-62\">The change of ownership provision typically gives the insurer the right to require a specific endorsement. In such a case, the policyowner must send the policy to the insurer, which adds an endorsement to the policy stating the name of the new owner. As in the case of a beneficiary change that must be endorsed on a policy, many courts apply the substantial compliance rule to situations in which an ownership change must be endorsed in the policy. If a policyowner has done everything possible to comply with the ownership change procedure set forth in the policy but has failed because of circumstances beyond her control, then such courts would consider the change to be effective.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-26\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-3\">Viatical Settlements and Life Settlements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-63\">A policyowner may, under certain circumstances, sell his rights in a life insurance policy to a third party. If the policyowner-insured is terminally ill, the transaction is known as a viatical settlement (from the Latin <em>viaticum</em>, meaning “provisions for a journey”). In a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-viaticalsettlement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-9\" role=\"doc-glossref\">viatical settlement</span>, a policyowner, typically a terminally ill individual with a life expectancy of 24 months or less, sells an insurance policy to a third party for more than its cash value but less than its face value. The purchaser becomes both policyowner and beneficiary. Viatical settlements, like the accelerated death benefits described in Chapter 11, are useful for policyowners who need cash to address immediate medical concerns.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-64\">A policyowner may be able to sell his rights in a policy even if he is not terminally ill. In general, the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for more than its cash surrender value but less than its face value is known as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-lifesettlement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-10\" role=\"doc-glossref\">life settlement</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-65\">Most states have passed laws to regulate life and viatical settlements. In most states, the seller (or <em>viator</em>) of a policy must be both policyowner and insured. During the settlement process, typically an advisor and a broker act as facilitators between the seller and the purchaser. The purchaser is typically a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-viaticalsettlementcompany\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-11\" role=\"doc-glossref\">viatical settlement company</span>, or <em>life settlement company</em>, which is an organization that exists to buy life insurance policies from policyowners at a discount. The organization assumes a policy’s premium payments and collects the death benefit of the policy upon the policyowner's death. An organization must meet state licensing requirements in order to legally purchase viatical or life settlements. Viatical settlement companies are part of the <em>secondary market</em> for life insurance policies, which is the market in which policies are traded after the initial sale.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-66\">Because in many cases a policyowner would receive a greater long-term return from retaining her policy, advisors typically propose viatical or life settlements in certain specific situations, such as:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch12-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-28\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-67\">The insured has outlived the need for the policy.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-29\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-68\">The policyowner can no longer afford to pay premiums.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-30\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-69\">A policy is not performing as desired or needed.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-31\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-70\">The policy beneficiary is deceased.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-32\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-71\">The insured could benefit from a different type of coverage, such as long-term care insurance.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-33\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-72\">The insured or owner has experienced changes in personal circumstances, such as divorce or retirement.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-73\">Viatical settlements in particular carry some risk for both the seller and the purchaser. The seller must be certain that a viatical settlement is the proper instrument to meet her needs; in some cases, an accelerated death benefit or policy loan might be more beneficial, as these options would allow the policyowner to receive some cash while retaining ownership of the policy. Also, the lump sum payment for the sale of the policy may be taxable, depending on the tax laws in the state where the seller resides. The risk to the purchaser is that the seller might live longer than expected, thus reducing or even eliminating the return on the purchaser’s investment. The insight below explains the origins of viatical settlements.</p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-27\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"The History of Viatical Settlements\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch12-img-23\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-74\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-28\"> <p class=\"insight-title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-75\">The History of Viatical Settlements</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-76\">In the United States, the legal basis for the viatical settlement was established in a 1911 case in which a terminally ill patient sold his life insurance policy to his physician so that he could afford a surgical procedure. <span class=\"ens\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-12\"> <span class=\"endnote hidden\" data-note=\"loma311-ch12-en1\" epub:type=\"noteref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-13\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</span> </span>The Supreme Court ruled that the owner of a life policy should possess the right to sell the policy, as with other forms of property, to avoid diminishing the value of the contract. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-77\">Viatical settlements became more common during the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. The typical seller was younger and possessed a life insurance policy on his own life, often provided by his employer, but needed ready cash to pay for medical procedures such as experimental drug therapy. Gradually, viatical settlements became less common for AIDS and HIV patients as life expectancies increased. The introduction of accelerated death benefits also offered another option for terminally or chronically ill policyowners.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-78\">The secondary market for life insurance has increased its focus on policyowners who are over 65 years of age, of high net worth, and who suffer from health impairments but are not necessarily terminally ill. Thus, many viatical settlement companies seek to purchase both viatical settlements and life settlements.</p> <p class=\"source-line\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-79\"><a class=\"pdf_inline_style\"

However, insurance policy values sometimes receive special exemptions from creditors’ claims.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-51\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-4\">Judgment Creditors</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-99\">We described the distinction between secured creditors and unsecured creditors in Chapter 6. A secured creditor—that is, a creditor who obtains a security interest in the debtor’s property—is protected if the debtor defaults on the loan. By contrast, if a debtor defaults on an unsecured loan, the creditor must sue the debtor and obtain a judgment to recover the unpaid amount. A creditor who has sued a debtor who has failed to repay a debt and has obtained a judgment against the debtor is referred to as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-judgmentcreditor\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-28\" role=\"doc-glossref\">judgment creditor</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-100\">Each state has enacted laws that govern how a judgment creditor may enforce that judgment by looking to property owned by the debtor. For example, if a debtor has money in a bank account, a judgment creditor can satisfy all or part of the judgment from the funds in the bank account. State laws provide exemptions for certain types of property that a judgment creditor cannot reach. The goal of such laws is to enable the debtor to continue to earn a living and provide for himself and his dependents.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-101\">Public policy seeks to encourage people to purchase life insurance to provide for their families and other dependents. Thus, laws in all states provide exemptions for life insurance policies, although the specific exemptions vary a great deal from state to state. The exemption laws in most states protect life insurance policy death benefits, cash values, and accrued dividends from the reach of judgment creditors. While a policy is in force, most such values are exempt from the claims of judgment creditors of the policyowner and of the beneficiary. Watch Video 12.1 for a few examples of exemptions by state.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video12-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-102\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-29\">Video 12.1</span> Examples of State Exemption Laws</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-52\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-53\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-103\">Examples of State Exemption Laws</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/12-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

For example, assume a policyowner-insured surrenders his policy for its cash surrender value. Once the insurer pays the cash surrender value to the policyowner, that money held by the policyowner generally loses its exemption from his creditors’ claims.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-105\">Similarly, a beneficiary’s creditors are not able to claim the policy death benefit while the policy is in force. Upon the insured’s death, however, the policy proceeds are payable to the beneficiary and may be subject to claims of the beneficiary’s creditors. The applicable state’s exemption law determines the rights of the beneficiary’s creditors, and statutes vary a great deal.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-106\">Exemption laws in some states protect life insurance policy proceeds from claims of the <em>policyowner</em>’s creditors but do not protect proceeds from claims of the <em>beneficiary</em>’s creditors. Laws in other states protect policy proceeds from creditors of both the policyowner and beneficiary. When proceeds are not exempt from claims by a beneficiary’s creditors, as soon as the beneficiary’s right to the policy proceeds vests, then the beneficiary’s creditors may follow the applicable state’s procedures to obtain repayment while the insurer has the money. Typically, a creditor in such a case uses the state’s garnishment procedure, which we described in Chapter 3. Later in the chapter, we describe a special type of trust that can be established to protect policy proceeds from the claims of a beneficiary’s creditors.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-65\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-5\">Creditor as Policyowner or Beneficiary</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-107\">Sometimes a creditor seeks to protect herself by taking out a policy on her debtor’s life and naming herself as the beneficiary. When a creditor purchases such a policy and pays the policy premiums, the creditor is entitled to receive the full policy proceeds after the insured’s death even if those proceeds are more than the amount of the unpaid debt.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-108\">A debtor may also purchase a policy on his own life and name the creditor as the policy beneficiary, or change an existing policy’s revocable beneficiary and make the creditor the new beneficiary.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-66\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-109\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-67\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-110\">When Agnes Zamojski purchased a $25,000 policy on her life, she owed $25,000 to Clint Shelton. To ensure that the debt would be repaid, Ms. Zamojski named Mr. Shelton as the policy beneficiary. When Ms. Zamojski died, the $25,000 debt remained unpaid. In most states, Mr. Shelton would be entitled to receive the entire policy proceeds, because they equaled the amount of the unpaid debt.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-111\">In most states, when a debtor names a creditor as the policy beneficiary, the creditor can recover only the amount of the unpaid debt. If the creditor paid any premiums for the policy, he can recover those premiums plus interest. Any policy proceeds remaining after the creditor is repaid are payable to the policyowner-insured’s estate.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch12-question-5-wrap\"> <div

In these circumstances, as well as a number of others, a policyowner may name a trust as a policy beneficiary. As we saw in Chapter 9, a <em>trust</em> is an arrangement in which one person, the <em>trustee</em>, holds title to property for the benefit of another, the <em>trust beneficiary</em>. The <em>settlor</em> or<em> grantor</em> is the person who creates a trust and transfers ownership of property to the trustee, who has a duty to manage the property for the trust beneficiary’s benefit. The settlor can deposit both real and personal property into a trust.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-119\">Ownership of trust property is split between the trustee and the trust beneficiary. The trustee has formal <em>legal title</em> to the property and, thus, is the legal owner of the property. The trust beneficiary has <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-equitabletitle\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-41\" role=\"doc-glossref\">equitable title</span>to the trust property, which means that the beneficiary has ownership rights based on considerations of fairness and equity rather than on legal ownership rights. The insight below further details the difference between legal and equitable title. </p> <div class=\"insight\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-76\" role=\"complementary\" aria-label=\"Legal and Equitable Title\"> <img alt=\"\" class=\"lightbulb\" id=\"loma311-ch12-img-104\" src=\"../../imgs/lightbulb.png\" /> <p class=\"insight-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-120\">INSIGHT</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-77\"> <!--fig end--> <!--fig start--> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-121\">Legal and Equitable Title</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-122\">Ownership of trust property is divided into two components: equitable title and legal title. All property has these two ownership interests, although one person may be both the legal and equitable owner of property. An everyday example of this division of interests is when someone purchases an automobile. If the purchaser pays cash for the vehicle, the purchaser has both legal and equitable title to the automobile. However, if the purchaser finances the purchase with a loan from a bank, finance company, or other lender, the lender may physically hold the automobile’s title documentation, or the title documentation may list the lender as a lien holder on the title. In both situations, the lender controls the legal title to the automobile. However, the person who purchased the automobile and borrowed the money to purchase the automobile has an equitable interest in the automobile and gets the economic benefit from it—possession of the vehicle.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-123\">If the purchaser wants to dispose of the automobile, the two parties have to cooperate; the purchaser has to convey his economic interest, and the lender has to convey legal title. Neither party can sell the vehicle without the other. When the purchaser repays the lender, the lender’s interest in the vehicle ends, and the purchaser thereafter owns both legal title and equitable title.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-124\">Ownership rights in a trust are similar to the ownership rights in the automobile. The trustee who holds legal title to trust property may control the timing and the amounts of the property distributions to the trust beneficiaries. Eventually, however, the trust beneficiaries will receive the assets in the trust.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-125\">Note that legal and equitable <em>title</em> are distinct from the legal and equitable <em>remedies</em> that we discussed in Chapter Two. Legal and equitable remedies are remedies assigned by a court following a civil suit, while legal and equitable title are inherent aspects of trust ownership.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-126\">A trustee is a fiduciary and, therefore, is obligated to act solely for the benefit of the trust beneficiary. A trustee’s fiduciary duties include:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch12-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-41\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-127\">The duty to manage the trust property by exercising the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in managing his own affairs.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch12-li-42\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch12-p-128\">A duty of loyalty to the trust beneficiary. The trustee must not allow his own personal interests to conflict with the interests of the beneficiary.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-129\">A trustee is liable to a trust beneficiary for any losses caused by a breach of the trustee’s fiduciary duties. If the trustee does not follow the settlor’s instructions in handling the trust property, then the beneficiaries have the right to ask a court to enforce the terms of the trust agreement. The court can then force the trustee to act in accordance with the settlor’s instructions.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-130\">Anyone who has the legal capacity to transfer property ownership may create a trust with that property. Thus, minors typically do not have the legal capacity to create a trust. In the past, a settlor was not permitted to be both the trustee and the sole trust beneficiary. Today, most states permit the settlor to be both the trustee and the trust beneficiary of a trust as long as specific requirements are met.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-78\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-6\">Reasons for Establishing a Trust</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-131\">Like other contractual arrangements, a trust requires a lawful purpose. When the purpose of a trust is illegal or against public policy, the trust is void and unenforceable. Thus, for example, a settlor may not transfer property as a way to defraud his creditors.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-132\">Settlors often create trusts to ensure that their dependents are provided for over a period of time. For example, a person with young children or children who are not capable of managing large sums of money may establish a trust and instruct the trustee to transfer trust assets to the trust beneficiaries only when they reach a specified age or only for specified purposes. A trust may also provide the means to care for children who are mentally or physically incapacitated throughout their lifetimes.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-79\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-133\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-80\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-134\">Mehdi Shamel recently divorced and purchased a policy on his own life. He established a trust to hold the life insurance proceeds in the event that he should die while his children are still minors. He names his brother, Gaffar, as the trustee and his children as the trust beneficiaries. Three years later, Mehdi dies in an automobile accident. The trust receives the policy proceeds, and Gaffar manages the policy proceeds for the Shamel children until the children come of age.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-135\">A trust can also be a useful estate planning tool. In the United States, when someone dies owning a probate estate valued at more than a specified dollar amount, the decedent’s estate is required to pay federal taxes known as <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-estatetaxes\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-42\" role=\"doc-glossref\">estate taxes</span>. Settlors often establish life insurance trusts to provide funds to pay estate taxes. In such a case, the life insurance policies that are held in trust become payable at the settlor’s death, and those funds can be used to pay any estate taxes payable at the settlor’s death. In addition, if the settlor transferred ownership of the life insurance policies to the trustee, then the policy proceeds payable are not included in the settlor’s taxable estate; thus, the amount of estate taxes owed is reduced.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-136\">With proper planning, transferring assets into an irrevocable living trust can reduce the assets in a decedent’s estate and, thus, can reduce the amount of estate taxes payable. In addition, assets that are not part of the settlors’ probate estate are available immediately to provide for the decedent’s dependents without going through the probate process.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-137\">A person can also create a trust for charitable purposes. For example, people sometimes transfer ownership of property into a trust that is established for the benefit of an educational or charitable organization. In such a case, the settlor can retain possession of the property during her lifetime; at the settlor’s death, possession of the property is transferred to the designated charity. By establishing a charitable trust, the settlor reduces the amount of her taxable estate.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-81\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch12-h3-7\">Types of Trusts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-138\">A trust that takes effect during the settlor’s lifetime is known as an <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-intervivostrust\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-43\" role=\"doc-glossref\">inter vivos trust</span>or a <em>living trust</em>. No specific formalities such as signing a written document are required to create a living trust, unless the trust property includes real property. However, the settlor usually drafts and signs a <em>trust agreement</em>, which is a written document that spells out the terms of the trust, including instructions as to how the trustee is to handle the trust property. The trust agreement may name one or more trustees, and it may name a bank or trust company to serve as trustee. The trust agreement may also name a successor trustee, who will assume the position of trustee if the original trustee can no longer serve that function. </p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-139\">In contrast to a living trust, a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-testamentarytrust\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-44\" role=\"doc-glossref\">testamentary trust</span> is a trust that takes effect at the settlor’s death. A testamentary trust must comply with the state’s applicable wills statute to be valid. Typically, the terms of a testamentary trust are included in the settlor’s will.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-140\">A settlor may establish a trust as a revocable trust or an irrevocable trust. When a trust is <em>revocable</em>, the settlor retains the right to change the terms of the trust or to dissolve the trust. When a trust is <em>irrevocable</em>, the settlor may not change or revoke the trust.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-141\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-insurancetrust\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-45\" role=\"doc-glossref\">insurance trust</span> is an irrevocable trust for which the trust property consists of insurance policies on the life of the settlor or the proceeds of such policies. Upon the insured’s death, life insurance policy proceeds held in trust are not included in the insured’s taxable estate. Thus, the insured can both reduce the amount of estate taxes owed and provide funds to pay estate taxes.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-142\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-spendthrifttrust\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">spendthrift trust</span> is a trust that is designed to keep trust property out of the hands of creditors of the trust beneficiary, by prohibiting the beneficiary from assigning or otherwise transferring her interest in the trust. This prohibition is the primary difference between a spendthrift trust and other trusts; most states permit the beneficiaries of other types of trusts to assign their interest in the trust. Thus, for example, a trust beneficiary can assign her interest in a trust as collateral for a loan. By prohibiting such assignments or other transfers of an interest in spendthrift trust property, a spendthrift trust protects the trust property from the trust beneficiary’s actions. In addition, state laws generally prohibit creditors from seizing the property in a spendthrift trust. After trust assets are transferred to the trust beneficiary, however, those assets can be seized by the beneficiary’s creditors. Later in the chapter, we describe how life insurance policyowners can use a spendthrift trust to protect a policy’s beneficiary.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-143\">To effectively protect the trust beneficiary, a spendthrift trust typically must be established as an irrevocable trust. In addition, the trustee generally is given full discretion in handling the trust assets. In most states, the settlor of a spendthrift trust cannot also be a trust beneficiary. A few states, however, now permit a person to establish a spendthrift trust and name himself as the trust beneficiary if certain requirements are met.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch12-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch12-question-6\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-144\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch12-img-105\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch12-question-6-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-145\">The trustee and the trust beneficiary share ownership of trust property.

As we saw in Chapter 8, most states require individual life insurance policies to include a <em>settlement options provision</em>, which grants the policyowner or beneficiary several choices as to how the insurer will pay the policy proceeds. The settlement options that insurers commonly offer in individual life insurance policies are identified in Figure 12.1.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:811px;\" id=\"figure12-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-157\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-55\">Figure 12.1</span> Common Settlement Options</p> <img alt=\"Common Settlement Options\" id=\"loma311-ch12-img-133\" src=\"../../imgs/12-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-94\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure12-1\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-56\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-95\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure12-1\" id=\"loma311-ch12-a-17\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 12-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-158\">A policyowner may select one of the settlement options at the time of application or at any other time while the policy is in force. The policyowner also has the right to change to another settlement option at any time during the insured’s life. When the policyowner selects a settlement option while the policy is in force, the terms of the settlement usually are incorporated into a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-settlementagreement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-57\" role=\"doc-glossref\">settlement agreement</span>, which is a contractual agreement between a life insurance policyowner and an insurer governing the rights and obligations of the parties after the insured’s death. The settlement agreement then becomes part of the life insurance contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-159\">A policyowner who selects a settlement option for the beneficiary may choose to make the settlement mode irrevocable. In such a case, the beneficiary will not be able to change to another settlement option when the policy proceeds become payable. If the settlement agreement does not state that the settlement mode is irrevocable, then the mode is considered to be revocable and the beneficiary has the right to select another settlement option when the proceeds become payable. Thus, the beneficiary can elect to receive the proceeds in a lump sum or can elect another settlement option provided by the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-160\">If the policyowner has not selected a settlement option when the policy proceeds become payable, then the beneficiary has the right to select a settlement option. In such a case, the life insurance contract matures at the insured’s death, and the beneficiary and the insurer enter into a new contract governing how the policy proceeds will be paid. Such a settlement agreement between an insurer and a policy beneficiary sometimes is referred to as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-supplementarycontract\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-58\" role=\"doc-glossref\">supplementary contract</span>.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-161\">The person who, if still living, will receive policy proceeds under a settlement agreement generally is referred to as a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-payee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-59\" role=\"doc-glossref\">payee</span> rather than as a beneficiary. Although the payee usually is the named beneficiary, the different terminology results from the fact that a payee under a settlement agreement may not have been the policy beneficiary. A policyowner often has the right to name a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-contingentpayee\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-60\" role=\"doc-glossref\">contingent payee</span> or <em>successor payee</em>, who will receive any policy proceeds payable following the payee’s death; the contingent payee may or may not have been assigned as the contingent beneficiary of the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-162\">Although neither contingent payees nor contingent beneficiaries have any vested rights to policy proceeds during the insured’s lifetime, the rights of a contingent payee and of a contingent beneficiary differ after the death of the insured. If a primary beneficiary survives the insured, then the expectancy of the contingent beneficiary is extinguished. By contrast, a contingent payee’s expectancy continues beyond the death of the insured. Watch Video 12.2 for an example of the different rights of contingent beneficiaries and contingent payees.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video12-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-163\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-61\">Video 12.2</span> Rights of Contingent Beneficiaries and Contingent Payees</p> <div class=\"video-container add-tips\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-96\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch12-div-97\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-164\">Rights of Contingent Beneficiaries and Contingent Payees</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/12-2video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch12-gt-spendthriftclause\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch12-span-68\" role=\"doc-glossref\">spendthrift clause</span> or <em>spendthrift trust clause</em> is a provision that may be included in a life insurance policy or settlement agreement to protect the policy proceeds from being seized by the beneficiary’s creditors. A policyowner can ask the insurer to add such a clause to a policy by adding a rider or endorsement to the policy or can enter into a settlement agreement that includes a spendthrift clause.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-166\">When a policy or settlement agreement includes a spendthrift clause, the beneficiary’s creditors cannot reach any money that is held by the insurer. In addition, the beneficiary is prohibited from assigning or otherwise transferring her interest in the policy proceeds. The beneficiary also is prohibited from changing the terms on which the policy proceeds are payable. For example, assume that $250,000 in policy proceeds became payable at the insured’s death. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the insurer agreed to pay out only a specified sum each month to the beneficiary. The beneficiary cannot change the terms of the settlement agreement. After the insurer pays money to the beneficiary, however, those funds can be reached by the beneficiary’s creditors.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch12-p-167\">Although a few states permit a person to establish a spendthrift trust and name himself as the trust beneficiary, a life insurance policyowner cannot try to protect himself with a spendthrift clause. Such a clause may be included only for the benefit of someone other than the policyowner. The law imposes this requirement to prevent a policyowner from trying to defraud his own creditors.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch12-question-8-wrap\"> <div

The insurer, on the other hand, is legally bound by its contractual promises for as long as premiums are paid. In some situations, however, an insurer contests the validity of an insurance policy. Typically, an insurer contests a policy for one of the following reasons:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch13-ul-7\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-30\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-30\">A material misrepresentation</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-31\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-31\">A defect in the formation of the contract</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-32\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-32\">A mistake</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-33\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-33\">The beneficiary wrongfully killed the insured</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-34\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-policycontest\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-6\" role=\"doc-glossref\">policy contest</span> is a court action to determine the validity of a life insurance policy. According to the rules of general contract law, when parties fail to enter into a valid contract, all parties must be returned as much as possible to the positions that they occupied before they attempted to enter into the contract. Therefore, when an insurer is successful in contesting the validity of an individual life insurance policy, the insurer generally must return to the policyowner all premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals. An insurer can contest a policy</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch13-ul-8\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-34\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-35\"><strong>During the insured’s lifetime.</strong> When an insurer learns that it has grounds to contest a life insurance policy <em>during the insured’s lifetime</em>, it notifies the policyowner that it has elected to rescind the policy. The insurer returns all premiums that have been paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals. If the policyowner does not accept the premium refund, the insurer initiates an action in court for rescission of the contract. We discuss rescission in more detail later in the chapter.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-35\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-36\"><strong>After the death of the insured.</strong> When an insurer learns that it has grounds to avoid a life insurance policy <em>after the death of the insured</em>, it denies payment of policy proceeds and returns to the policyowner or the policyowner’s estate all premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals. A claimant to life insurance policy proceeds who decides to challenge an insurer’s action may file an action in court to enforce the contract. The insurer’s defense to the claimant’s action is that the contract was invalid.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-37\">Note, however, that once a contract ends, the parties may no longer contest the validity of that contract. For example, after policy proceeds have been paid, the policy ends and the insurer can no longer contest it.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-38\">Not every court action involving a life insurance policy is a policy contest. Sometimes, an insurer denies a claim or takes an action for a reason other than a challenge of a contract’s validity. For instance, an insurer may deny a claim because the insured died as a result of a cause that the policy excludes from coverage. When an insurer denies a claim based on a provision in the life insurance policy, the insurer is performing the contract according to the terms of the policy. Because such an action acknowledges the validity of the contract, it is not a policy contest. We discuss performance of contracts in more detail in Chapter 14. The following exercise illustrates the difference between performing and contesting a life insurance policy.&#160;</p> <div class=\"kInteractive widget widget904\" data-kotobee=\"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\" id=\"ki-wdgt-4567\" style=\"\"></div> <p class=\"txt\">&#160;</p> <p class=\"txt\">&#160;</p> <div aria-hidden=\"true\" id=\"modalOverlay\"> <div aria-labelledby=\"modalTitle\" aria-modal=\"true\" id=\"modalAlertBox\" role=\"dialog\"> <div class=\"header\"><span aria-label=\"Close\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">×</span> </div> <div class=\"modalAlertContent\">&#160;</div> </div> </div> </section> </body></html>"

As a general rule, if one party makes a material misrepresentation, then the contract is voidable by the innocent party. A material misrepresentation induces a party to enter into a contract that it would not have entered into had it known the truth. Thus, when an applicant makes a misrepresentation that induces an insurer to enter into a life insurance policy that the insurer would not have entered into had it known the truth, the policy is voidable by the insurer. In this situation, the insurer has the option of avoiding the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-40\">Each jurisdiction has its own requirements that insurers must meet to successfully challenge the validity of a life insurance policy based on a misrepresentation in the application for insurance. Most jurisdictions require that an insurer prove these three elements:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch13-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-36\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-41\">The applicant or proposed insured misrepresented or failed to disclose a fact.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-37\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-42\">The fact was known by the applicant or proposed insured at the time of the misrepresentation or failure to disclose.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-38\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-43\">The fact was material—or relevant—to the insurer’s acceptance of the risk.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-44\">Usually, when the validity of a contract is contested in court, the party who seeks to avoid the contract bears the burden of proof. Thus, when an insurer seeks to avoid a life insurance policy on the grounds of material misrepresentation, the insurer has the burden of proving the three elements shown above. How an insurer meets its burden of proving a material misrepresentation varies depending on the facts of each case.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-5\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-1\">Duty to Disclose</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-45\">When an insurer underwrites an individual life insurance policy, it decides if the proposed insured is an insurable risk and, if so, what premium rate to charge for the coverage. Information needed to make these decisions comes from the applicant for insurance or the proposed insured. An insurer, therefore, must be able to rely on the truth of the statements in the application.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-46\">The <em>duty to disclose</em> requires applicants and proposed insureds to disclose to the insurer any fact that is within their knowledge and that is material to the insurance. Thus, the applicant and the proposed insured must provide truthful and complete information in the application for insurance, in a medical examination, and in written statements or answers furnished to the insurer as evidence of insurability. Note that this duty to disclose is breached if an applicant or proposed insured (1) provides false information or (2) conceals a material fact.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-6\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-47\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-7\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-48\">In an application for life insurance, the applicant was asked to list every doctor’s visit in the last five years and explain the reason and result for each visit. The applicant noted that she had visited her family doctor four times: three times for routine physical examinations and once because she was feeling tired. In fact, the applicant had three routine physical examinations, but after her fourth visit, the doctor referred her to a specialist who informed her that she had end stage kidney failure.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-49\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>The applicant failed to meet her duty to disclose because she did not disclose on the application for insurance the result of the fourth doctor’s visit. She concealed the fact that a specialist diagnosed her with end stage kidney failure. In this case, the concealment provides grounds for the insurer to contest the life insurance policy.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-8\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-2\">Known Facts</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-50\">In providing an insurer with evidence of insurability, an applicant or a proposed insured is required to disclose only those facts that are known by the applicant or proposed insured at the time of the disclosure. A person is not required to speculate on the proposed insured’s health status.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-9\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-51\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-10\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-52\">Juan Guzman had a series of routine medical tests after experiencing periods of fatigue. His doctor told him that he was in good health and that the tests were a precaution. The results of the tests revealed diabetes. The doctor, however, did not discuss the results with Mr. Guzman, who later completed an application for life insurance. In the application, Mr. Guzman disclosed that he had experienced periods of fatigue and undergone medical tests.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-53\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>By disclosing that he had experienced periods of fatigue and undergone medical tests, Mr. Guzman met his duty to disclose because he revealed the facts that were within his knowledge.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-11\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-3\">Material to the Insurance</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-54\">According to the rules of contract law, statements made by parties when they enter into a contract can be classified as either warranties or representations.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch13-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-39\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-55\">A <em>warranty</em>, as we have seen, is a promise or guarantee recognized by law that a statement of fact is true. A warranty that is not <em>literally</em> true gives an injured party grounds to avoid the contract. In the past, the doctrine of warranties sometimes resulted in unjust results when applied to life insurance. For example, assume that an applicant for life insurance said that she had visited a doctor for treatment of a toe on her <em>left</em> foot when in fact the visit was for treatment of a toe on her <em>right</em> foot. Under the doctrine of warranties, the insurer had grounds to rescind the contract even though the error was not material to the insurance and thus would not have affected the insurer’s decision to issue the policy. Laws throughout the United States now specify that, in the absence of fraud, statements made in life insurance applications are representations and not warranties.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-40\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-56\">A <em>representation</em> is a statement made by a contracting party that is influential in inducing the other party to enter into the contract. A representation can be used to invalidate the contract if the statement is not <em>substantially</em> true and the statement induced the other party to enter into the contract. In other words, if a party misrepresents a fact that is material to the insurance, the contract is voidable by the other party. A misrepresentation is considered to be material to the insurance when the insurer—if it had known the truth—would have evaluated the proposed risk differently. Generally, a misrepresentation is material if the insurer with knowledge of the true facts would have taken any of the following actions with regard to the policy: (1) declined to issue, (2) increased the premium rate, or (3) excluded coverage for certain risks.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-57\">The question of whether a misrepresented or concealed fact was material to the insurance is a question of fact that must be answered from the point of view of the insurer. The answer does <em>not</em> depend on what a reasonable person in the applicant’s position would have considered to be material to the insurance.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-58\">In a few states, an insurer can avoid a life insurance policy on the grounds of material misrepresentation <em>only </em>if the cause of the insured’s death was directly related to the misrepresentation. In most states, however, an insurer can avoid a life insurance policy on the grounds of material misrepresentation even if the cause of the insured’s death was not related to the fact that was misrepresented.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-59\">When a proposed insured makes a misrepresentation regarding <em>medical history</em> on the application for life insurance, an insurer may seek to avoid the contract on the grounds of a material misrepresentation. However, when a proposed insured makes a misrepresentation regarding <em>age or sex</em> on the application for life insurance, the actions an insurer may take usually are determined by the provisions of the life insurance policy. In most jurisdictions, a misrepresentation regarding an insured’s age or sex affects the premium rate that an insurer charges for life insurance. Thus, a misstatement of the insured’s age or sex is a significant issue.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-60\">In the United States and many other countries, life insurance policies typically include a <em>misstatement of age or sex provision</em> that describes the action an insurer will take in the event that the age or sex of the insured is incorrectly stated. Note that when an insurer takes action because of a misstatement of age or sex, the insurer is enforcing the policy’s misstatement of age or sex provision. Such an action by the insurer is <em>not</em> considered a contest to the validity of the contract and is not prohibited by the incontestability provision, which we discuss in the next section. As Video 13.1 illustrates, when a proposed insured makes a misrepresentation regarding age or sex on an application for life insurance, the insurer’s action—as specified in the policy—depends on when the misstatement is discovered.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video13-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-61\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-7\">Video 13.1</span> Misstatement of Age or Sex</p> <div class=\"video-container\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-12\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-13\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-62\">Misstatement of Age or Sex</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/13-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

An insurer’s primary barrier to contesting the validity of a life insurance policy is the incontestability provision. Other barriers to contesting the validity of a policy arise when:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch13-ul-11\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-48\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-76\">An agent’s knowledge of a misrepresentation is considered the principal’s knowledge as well.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-77\">The insurer delays in acting on its knowledge of a misrepresentation.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-78\">The insurer fails to inquire about ambiguous answers provided on the application for insurance.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-79\">The insurer does not provide the policyowner with a copy of the insurance application.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-37\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-4\">Incontestability Provision</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-80\">The rules of contract law give an insurer the right to avoid an otherwise enforceable insurance contract if the applicant misrepresented material facts in the application for insurance. Laws in most jurisdictions, however, limit the time within which an insurer has this right.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-81\">As we have seen, the <em>incontestability provision</em> is a life insurance policy provision that denies the insurer the right to avoid the contract on the grounds of a material misrepresentation in the application after the contract has been in force for a specified period of time. The <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-contestableperiod\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-22\" role=\"doc-glossref\">contestable period</span>is the time period within which the insurer has the right to avoid a policy on the grounds of a material misrepresentation in the application. A typical incontestability provision reads as follows: </p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-38\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-39\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-82\"><strong>Incontestability</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-83\">We will not contest the validity of this policy after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for two years from the date of issue.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-84\">The above incontestability provision limits the period during which the insurer can avoid the policy to two years from the date of issue. A two-year contestable period is the maximum period allowed by most states. Some insurers include a one-year contestable period in their policies. The states permit this shorter period because it is more favorable to policyowners. The phrase <em>during the lifetime of the insured</em> is an important part of an incontestability provision. The phrase ensures that the policy never becomes incontestable if the person whose life is insured dies during the contestable period. Thus, the insurer will <em>always</em> have the opportunity to investigate for material misrepresentation if the death of the insured occurred within the policy’s contestable period.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-85\">If the phrase <em>during the lifetime of the insured</em> was <em>not</em> included in the incontestability provision and the insured died during the contestable period, a claimant could delay making a death claim until after the contestable period ended. In this case, because the policy’s contestable period no longer applied when the insurer received the death claim, the insurer could not contest the validity of the contract even if it discovered a material misrepresentation. Video 13.2 provides an example of how this phrase affects an insurer’s ability to contest a policy when the insured dies during the contestable period.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video13-2\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-86\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-23\">Video 13.2</span> Death of the Insured during the Contestable Period</p> <div class=\"video-container\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-40\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-41\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-87\">Death of the Insured during the Contestable Period</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/13-2video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

provision gives policyowners and beneficiaries the knowledge that if (1) all required premiums are paid and (2) the policy has been in force during the insured’s lifetime for at least the stated contestable period, then the insurer cannot contest the policy’s validity and usually must pay policy proceeds after the insured’s death.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-53\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-1\">Contestable Period Start Date</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-89\">Individual life insurance policies often include a date of issue and an effective date. The <em>date of issue</em> is the date the application is approved and the policy is issued by the insurer. The <em>effective date</em> is the date insurance coverage starts. Life insurance policies typically specify that the contestable period starts on the date of issue. Similarly, most states require a two-year contestable period that starts on the date of issue. Sometimes, however, the policy does not specify the date the contestable period starts. When this situation occurs and the date of issue and the effective date are not the same, an ambiguity arises as to which date should be used to determine the start of the contestable period. Under rules of contract construction, ambiguities in a contract are construed against the party that drafted the contract. In this case, a court would interpret the terms of the contract in a manner that is more favorable to the policyowner. Thus, a court would likely choose the date that allows the contestable period to expire as early as possible.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-54\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-90\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-55\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-91\">The ABC Insurance Company issued an individual life insurance policy to Victor Wells. The policy’s date of issue was October 20, 2018, but ABC backdated the policy’s effective date to October 1, 2018. The policy did not specify the date on which the contestable period began.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-92\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>Because the policy did not specify the date the contestable period began, an ambiguity arose as to which date should be used to determine the start of the contestable period. Under rules of contract construction, a court would construe the ambiguity against ABC and in favor of Mr. Wells because ABC drafted the contract. The court would likely determine that the contestable period started on October 1, the effective date, because that date allows the contestable period to expire as early as possible.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-56\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-2\">Effect of Reinstatement</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-93\">As we saw in Chapter 11, if a life insurance policy is reinstated, a new contestable period typically starts on the date the policy is reinstated. The length of the new contestable period is the same as the length of the policy’s original contestable period. In other words, if the original contestable period was two years, then the new contestable period would be two years from the reinstatement date. During the new contestable period, the insurer may contest the policy based on misrepresentations in the <em>reinstatement application</em>. In addition, the insurer may contest the policy based on misrepresentations in the <em>original application</em> as long as the <em>original</em> contestable period has not expired. See Video 13.3 for an example of how contestable periods work when a life insurance policy is reinstated.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video13-3\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-94\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-30\">Video 13.3</span> Contestable Period When a Policy Is Reinstated</p> <div class=\"video-container\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-57\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-58\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-95\">Contestable Period When a Policy Is Reinstated</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/13-3video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

Likewise, a doctor who conducts a medical examination of a proposed insured on behalf of an insurer is acting as the insurer’s agent. Recall that, according to the general rules of agency law, knowledge that an agent gains while acting in his capacity as an agent is considered to be knowledge of the principal. Based on this rule, if an insurance agent or a doctor has knowledge of facts about a proposed insured, then the insurer usually is considered to have that knowledge.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-97\">If an agent inadvertently records false answers on an application without the knowledge of the applicant, the courts in most states hold that the insurer is considered to have the agent’s knowledge. Therefore, the insurer is considered to have the information that the applicant gave to the agent. In a minority of states, however, the courts do not consider the insurer to have the knowledge of the agent in such a case. In these states, the applicant for insurance has a duty to ensure that all of the information is accurate before signing the application.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-71\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-98\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-72\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-99\">An insurance agent helped Vera Yip complete an application for an insurance policy on her life. Ms. Yip told the agent that she had been treated for an illness the previous year. Unintentionally, the agent recorded the information incorrectly on the application and it appeared that Ms. Yip did not reveal this information. The insurer issued the policy as applied for. Ms. Yip died during the contestable period, and the insurer discovered the misrepresentation on the application.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-100\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>Whether the insurer is able to contest the validity of the policy on the basis of the misrepresentation depends on the jurisdiction in which the policy was delivered.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-101\">In most states, the courts hold that the insurer is considered to have the agent’s knowledge. Thus, in these states the insurer may not contest the validity of Ms. Yip’s policy on the basis of the misrepresentation in the application.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-102\">In a minority of states, the courts do not consider the insurer to have the agent’s knowledge. In these states, Ms. Yip had a duty to ensure the accuracy of her signed application. Thus, the insurer may contest the validity of the policy on the basis of the misrepresentation in the application.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-103\">Sometimes an agent of an insurer and an applicant engage in <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-collusion\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">collusion</span>, which is an agreement between two or more people to defraud another person or entity of certain rights. When an agent and an applicant engage in collusion, the agent’s knowledge is <em>not</em> considered to be the knowledge of the insurer.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-73\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-104\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-74\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-105\">An applicant for life insurance had a health impairment that made her uninsurable. The applicant told the insurance agent about her condition, and the agent agreed to falsify the application to conceal the condition from the insurer so that the applicant could obtain a life insurance policy. The insurer issued a policy at a standard premium rate, and several months later the insured died.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-106\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>Because of the collusion between the applicant and the insurer’s agent, the agent’s knowledge of the insured’s health impairment would <em>not</em> be attributed to the insurer. Thus, the insurer has the right to avoid the contract because of material misrepresentation.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-75\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-6\">Delay by the Insurer</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-107\">An insurer may be prevented from contesting the validity of a life insurance policy if the insurer learns of—or has a sufficient reason to suspect—a misrepresentation and yet fails to act on that information within a reasonable time. By failing to take action to contest the contract on a timely basis, the insurer is deemed to have waived its right to contest the contract’s validity.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-76\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-108\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-77\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-109\">Joe Cink failed to disclose material information on an application for life insurance. Shortly after issuing a policy to Mr. Cink, the insurer learned of the misrepresentation. The insurer, however, did not investigate or take action to contest the contract until it received a death claim 20 months later.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-110\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>The insurer would likely be barred from contesting the validity of the contract because it failed to act within a reasonable time and thus waived its right to contest the policy.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-111\">What constitutes a reasonable time within which an insurer must act is a question of fact that depends on the circumstances of a particular case.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-78\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-7\">Failure to Inquire</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-112\">Sometimes the answers on an application for life insurance are ambiguous, conflicting, or missing. In such cases, the insurer has received information that should cause it to question the truth or completeness of representations on the application. When the insurer has information that would cause a prudent person to investigate further, and the insurer fails to do so, the insurer may be unsuccessful in later contesting the validity of the contract on the basis of a material misrepresentation in the application.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-79\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-113\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-80\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-114\">An applicant indicated in a life insurance application that he was taking a prescription medication. However, he did not indicate the medical condition for which the medication had been prescribed. The insurer issued the policy without investigating further. The insured died shortly thereafter as a result of a chronic disease for which he had been taking the medication.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-115\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>Although the insured did not disclose the fact that he was suffering from the disease, the insurer likely would have discovered the truth had it further investigated the application. As a result, the insurer may be unsuccessful in contesting the policy on the grounds of material misrepresentation.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-116\">Note that when an insurer investigates an application and then issues a policy, the insurer is not prevented from avoiding the policy if the application contains material misrepresentations. In responding to an insurer’s inquiries, the proposed insured has a duty to disclose all facts material to the insurance.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-81\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-117\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-82\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-118\">Before approving an application for life insurance, an underwriter for Lux Life Insurance Company conducted an investigation. The underwriter asked the proposed insured several questions about her health history and concluded that the applicant was an insurable risk. Lux Life issued a policy. During the policy’s contestable period, the insured died and Lux Life discovered that the application for insurance contained a number of material misrepresentations.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-119\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>Although the insurer conducted its own investigation and concluded that the insured was an insurable risk, the applicant’s duty of disclosure remained. As long as the insurer had no reasonable grounds to inquire further about specific representations, it most likely can avoid the contract because of the applicant’s material misrepresentations.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-83\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-8\">Copy of the Application</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-120\">In the United States, the insurance policy and the attached application usually constitute the entire contract. In most states, an insurer has the right to use a material misrepresentation in the life insurance application as a basis for avoiding a life insurance policy <em>only</em> if a copy of the application is attached to the policy when the policy is delivered to the applicant. The application for insurance is not considered a part of the contract unless it is attached to the policy when the policy is issued. The only exception to this rule is when a policy is issued electronically. In such a case, the insurer must provide the policyowner with a copy of the application, but the application does not have to be physically attached to the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-121\">Requiring that the application for life insurance be attached to the life insurance policy ensures that the owner of the policy receives every document that may affect his rights or benefits under the contract. In addition, this requirement gives the policyowner a chance to identify any mistakes that may have been made in the application.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-4-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-4\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-122\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch13-img-78\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-4-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-123\">Sometimes an insurer is prevented from contesting the validity of a life insurance policy even after the insurer discovers that a material fact was misrepresented.

As this section shows, an insurer has the right to contest the validity of a policy on grounds other than material misrepresentation and can do so at any time while the policy is in force. However, once a contract ends, the parties may no longer contest the validity of that contract.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-96\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-9\">Defect in the Formation of the Contract</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-135\">Recall that the formation of a valid informal contract, such as a life insurance policy, involves four requirements: mutual assent, adequate consideration, contractual capacity, and lawful purpose. If any one of these requirements is missing, the parties never entered into a valid contract. A party has the right to contest a contract’s validity at any time if any requirement was not met.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-136\">As we have seen, state insurance laws impose an insurable interest requirement on individual life insurance policies. This requirement guards against policies being purchased as wagering contracts. Requiring the policyowner to have had an insurable interest when the policy was issued ensures that the lawful purpose requirement for forming a contract is met. If no insurable interest existed at the time of contracting, the contract is void. The incontestability provision, therefore, does not prohibit contesting a policy based on lack of an insurable interest. The insurer may contest a contract’s validity based on lack of an insurable interest at any time while the policy is in force.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-97\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-10\">Mistake</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-137\">A contract is sometimes void or voidable because one or both parties made a mistake when entering the contract. Only certain types of mistakes, however, affect the validity of a contract. For instance, if one party to a contract makes an error in judgment and later realizes that he made a bad bargain, he must honor the contract. The courts will not remedy a bad bargain. The types of mistakes that make a contract void or voidable are mistakes that prevent the parties from mutually assenting to the terms of the agreement. Without this mutual assent, no contract is formed.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-98\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-3\">Mistake of Law or Mistake of Fact</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-138\">Mistakes can be characterized as either mistakes of law or mistakes of fact. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-mistakeoflaw\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-46\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mistake of law</span> occurs when, with full knowledge of the facts, the parties make a mistake as to the legal effect of those facts. A mistake of law has no effect on the validity of the contract.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-99\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-139\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-100\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-140\">An applicant applied for an individual life insurance policy. Both the applicant and the insurer were aware that the policy, if issued, would have a free look provision as required by law. This provision would give the applicant a certain period of time after the policy was issued to return the policy to the insurer for a full refund of the initial premium. The applicant believed that the law in his state required a 30-day free look provision. In fact, the law required a 10-day free look provision.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-141\"><strong>Analysis. </strong>The insurer issued a policy with a 10-day free look provision. The applicant made a mistake of law in believing that the law required a 30-day free look provision. This mistake of law, however, had no effect on the validity of the contract.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-142\">In contrast to a mistake of law, a mistake of fact can render a contract void or voidable. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-mistakeoffact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-47\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mistake of fact</span> occurs when one or both parties is mistaken as to the existence of something or as to the identity of something or someone. The incontestability provision does not prohibit a contest of the policy on the grounds of a mistake of fact. Either party can contest a contract’s validity on the grounds of a mistake of fact at any time, even after the contestable period has expired.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-101\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-4\">Unilateral or Bilateral Mistake</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-143\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-unilateralmistake\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-48\" role=\"doc-glossref\">unilateral mistake</span> is a mistake made by only one of the parties to a contract. The effect of a unilateral mistake of fact depends on the type of mistake and the circumstances. For example, assume that the offeror mistakenly misstates the price of the contract. If the offeree reasonably relied on the price as it was stated and entered into a contract, the contract is valid and binding. In contrast, if a reasonable person in the position of the offeree would have known that the offeror made a mistake in stating the price, then the contract generally is voidable by the offeror. In such a case, the party who made the unilateral mistake may avoid the contract after discovering the mistake.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-144\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-bilateralmistake\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-49\" role=\"doc-glossref\">bilateral mistake</span> occurs when both parties are mistaken when they enter into a contract.

When the parties make a common mistake as to the<em> identity or existence </em>of the subject matter of the contract, the contract is void.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-102\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-146\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-103\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-147\">An applicant for life insurance and the insurer were both unaware that the proposed insured died before the policy was issued. The contracting parties thus made a mistake of fact because they were mistaken as to the existence of the proposed insured. As a result of a common mistake of fact, the life insurance policy is void.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-148\">When the parties to a contract make a common mistake about a <em>general characteristic</em> concerning the subject matter of the contract, the contract usually is valid.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-104\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-149\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-105\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-150\">Two parties entered into a contract for the sale of a building.

The parties made a common mistake about a general characteristic of the subject matter—that is, the building’s age. In most jurisdictions, the contract is valid.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-151\">A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-mutualmistake\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-51\" role=\"doc-glossref\">mutual mistake</span> occurs when both parties to a contract make a mistake, but they make different mistakes. If the parties are unaware of a mutual mistake as to the subject matter of the contract and are at cross-purposes when entering the contract, then the contract usually is void. This type of mutual mistake involves a misunderstanding between the parties.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-152\">Note that some mutual mistakes may not render a contract void if both parties are in agreement as to what the terms of the agreement <em>should</em> have been. For example, when both parties make mutual mistakes in drafting a contract, a common remedy is to permit reformation of the contract to reflect the actual intent of the parties.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-153\">Figure 13.1 illustrates the distinctions between the various types of mistakes.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:927px;\" id=\"figure13-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-154\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-52\">Figure 13.1</span> Types of Mistakes</p> <img alt=\"Types of Mistakes\" class=\"usesFloatingControlbar\" id=\"loma311-ch13-img-106\" src=\"../../imgs/13-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-106\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure13-1\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-53\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-107\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure13-1\" id=\"loma311-ch13-a-18\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 13-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-108\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-11\">Beneficiary Wrongfully Kills the Insured</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-155\">In the United States and other common law jurisdictions, laws exist to prevent people from profiting from criminal acts. For this reason, when a person purchases a life insurance policy with the intention of killing the insured to collect policy proceeds, the insurance policy is void. Many times such intent is proven through evidence presented at a trial. When an insurer relies upon evidence presented at a trial that resulted in a conviction, the insurer has good reason to believe that its claim denial will stand if challenged.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-156\">When a person purchases a life insurance policy with the intention of killing the insured to collect policy proceeds, the insurer is not liable to pay the policy proceeds and is responsible only for returning to the policyowner the premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals. In this situation, the incontestability provision does not prohibit a contest of the policy, and the insurer can contest the contract’s validity at any time.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-157\">If, on the other hand, the policy was not purchased with the intention of killing the insured, but a beneficiary later is convicted in a civil or criminal court of wrongfully killing the insured, the contract is valid. The beneficiary, however, is disqualified from receiving policy proceeds. In this situation, the insurer must pay the policy proceeds to someone—usually another beneficiary. If no other beneficiary exists, the insurer usually pays the proceeds to the policyowner or the policyowner’s estate. We discuss disqualification of a beneficiary in more detail in Chapter 14.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-6\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-158\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch13-img-107\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-6-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-159\">True/False: A contract is sometimes void or voidable because one or both parties made a mistake when entering the contract.

If a claimant is successful, a court typically orders the insurer to pay damages, which is the basic legal remedy for most civil wrongs.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-175\">Civil damage awards generally provide a plaintiff with compensatory damages. Compensatory damages reimburse an injured party for the monetary losses that resulted from the defendant’s wrongful conduct. In an action for breach of contract, compensatory damages usually are measured as the benefit of the bargain—that is, the amount that restores the plaintiff to the financial position he would have been in if the contract had been performed. For a claimant to life insurance policy proceeds, the benefit of the bargain is the amount of policy proceeds payable by the insurer.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-176\">Punitive damages are awarded in addition to compensatory damages when a defendant’s conduct was malicious or willful. Punitive damages generally are not available in actions based on breach of contract. An exception to this rule is a situation in which an insurer breaches its duty to act in good faith. The duty to act in good faith requires an insurer to deal ethically and fairly with its customers when deciding whether to pay or deny a claim. Many jurisdictions allow plaintiffs to bring bad-faith tort actions against insurers that breach this duty.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-177\">No single factor determines whether an insurer has acted in bad faith. The courts most often look for evidence of whether the insurer denied claims unreasonably. In determining whether the insurer’s actions are unreasonable, most courts examine an insurer’s overall conduct and its reasons for denying claims.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-178\">Because insurers found to have acted in bad faith may be liable to pay punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages, a plaintiff who proves that an insurer has breached its duty of good faith may recover damages that exceed the amount of the policy’s basic death benefit and supplemental benefits.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-118\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch13-h3-13\">Equitable Remedies</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-179\">The equitable remedies granted to plaintiffs in civil actions involving life insurance policies include rescission, reformation, interpleader, declaratory judgment, and restitution.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-119\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-5\">Rescission</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-180\">The remedy of rescission is of special importance to insurers. Rescission allows a contract to be cancelled and the parties returned to the positions they would have been in if no contract had been created. When a contract is rescinded, the contract is void. Contracts may be rescinded in a number of ways, such as the following:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch13-ul-13\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-68\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-181\">The parties can mutually agree to rescind a contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-69\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-182\">One of the parties may exercise her right to rescind the contract.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch13-li-70\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch13-p-183\">A court or regulator may order that a contract be rescinded.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-184\">The parties to a contract can mutually agree to rescind the contract if they have contractual capacity. In this case, they can agree to rescind the contract and they need not apply to the courts to do so.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-120\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-185\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-121\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-186\">While the insured was still alive, an insurer discovered that the insured materially misrepresented his health in the application for life insurance. The insurer and the policyowner may mutually agree to rescind the contract.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-187\">A contract that is voidable at the option of one of the parties can be rescinded when that party exercises her right to rescind the contract. When a party has a legal right to avoid—that is, rescind—a contract without incurring legal liability, that party can exercise that right without having to resort to the courts. A party who has the right to avoid a contract can do so by (1) notifying the other party of the decision to rescind the contract and (2) returning to the other party the consideration given for the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-188\">In some cases, a contract may be rescinded by a court order.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-122\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-189\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-123\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-190\">An insurer discovered during a policy’s contestable period that the applicant for life insurance materially misrepresented his health in the application for insurance. The policyowner did not agree to rescind the contract. To protect its right to contest the policy, the insurer must ask the court to rescind the contract while the policy remains contestable.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-191\">When a contract is rescinded, each party must return to the other party whatever he has received under the contract. Thus, to rescind a life insurance policy, the insurer must return to the policyowner the total amount of premiums paid plus any interest minus any withdrawals on the policy.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-124\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-6\">Reformation</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-192\">Reformation is an equitable remedy in which a written contract is rewritten to express the original agreement of the contracting parties. Reformation is available when parties reach an agreement and put it in writing, but the written document does not adequately reflect the parties’ intent. If the parties cannot mutually agree to correct such a mistake, one party may ask the court to correct the mistake in the written contract.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-193\">A plaintiff who seeks reformation of a contract must present the court with clear and convincing evidence as to the terms of the parties’ actual agreement. <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-clearandconvincingevidence\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-60\" role=\"doc-glossref\">Clear and convincing evidence </span>means a degree of proof in which evidence shows that the truth of the facts asserted is highly probable and leaves no reasonable doubt as to the truth of those facts. Clear and convincing evidence is a higher degree of proof than a preponderance of the evidence, which is the degree of proof generally required in civil court actions. As we saw in Chapter 2, <em>preponderance of the evidence</em> means that the decision as to an issue of fact must be supported by the greater weight of the evidence.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-125\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-194\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-126\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-195\">A party to a lawsuit asked the court to correct a mistake in a written contract and presented evidence as to the terms of the parties’ actual agreement.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-196\">If the trier of fact finds that the evidence shows—with a 51 percent likelihood—that the fact is true, then the party has proved the fact by a <em>preponderance of the evidence</em>. That evidence, however, is not clear and convincing evidence of the fact. In this case, the court likely would not correct the mistake in the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-197\">If, however, the trier of fact finds that the evidence shows—with an overwhelming likelihood—that the fact is true, then the party has proven the fact by <em>clear and convincing evidence</em>. In this case, the court likely would rule to correct the mistake in the contract.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-127\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-7\">Interpleader</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-198\">Another equitable remedy available to insurers is <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch13-gt-interpleader\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch13-span-61\" role=\"doc-glossref\">interpleader</span>, which is a court proceeding under which an insurer that cannot determine the proper recipient of policy proceeds pays the proceeds to a court and asks the court to decide the proper recipient. A party who seeks the remedy of interpleader must be a disinterested stakeholder. In other words, the party cannot have a personal claim to the money or property in question. When an insurer files a life insurance interpleader, the court, not the insurer, determines who is entitled to the proceeds. After paying the money into the court, the insurer usually is released from any further liability under the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-199\">Interpleader is an important remedy for an insurer that is uncertain about who should receive policy proceeds. Because of beneficiary changes, assignments, and other policy transactions, insurers sometimes must decide between conflicting claimants to policy proceeds. If the insurer pays policy proceeds to a claimant who is not entitled to the proceeds, the proper claimant can later assert a claim to the proceeds. In this case, the insurer may be obligated to pay the proceeds again. Interpleader prevents this possibility because after the insurer pays the policy proceeds into court, the conflicting claimants are prevented from pursuing other legal action against the insurer to recover the proceeds.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-128\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-8\">Declaratory Judgment</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-200\">In common law jurisdictions, courts have the power to make determinations as to legal rights when no one has been injured. A <em>declaratory judgment</em>, as we saw in Chapter 2, is a judicial statement that declares or denies the parties’ legal rights but does not include specific relief or any means to enforce those rights. A declaratory judgment is available at the discretion of the court and typically is not granted if any other appropriate remedy is available. Insurers might seek this type of remedy to resolve issues involving interpretation of policy provisions or insurance laws. For instance, if an insurer has a question about the legality of a new insurance law, the insurer might ask a court to issue a declaratory judgment interpreting the law. Another example is that competing beneficiaries may file an action for a declaratory judgment to establish the proper beneficiary of a life insurance policy.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch13-div-129\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch13-h4-9\">Restitution</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-201\"><em>Restitution</em>, as we saw in Chapter 2, is a remedy under which a party is ordered to return property to its owner or to the person entitled to it. Restitution sometimes is granted as a legal remedy and other times as an equitable remedy. For life insurance policies, restitution is a remedy that might be sought when an insurer overpays policy proceeds or pays proceeds to the wrong claimant. For example, assume that an insurer pays policy proceeds to the wrong claimant. Later, the proper claimant asserts his claim to the proceeds, and the insurer discovers that it paid the wrong claimant. The insurer can then seek restitution from the claimant who was not entitled to the proceeds. In such a situation, a court likely would order the claimant who was not entitled to the proceeds to repay the insurer the amount of policy proceeds paid in error.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-8-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\" data-qtype=\"mc\" epub:type=\"question\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-8\"> <p class=\"q-title\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-202\"> <img alt=\"Let’s Review\" id=\"loma311-ch13-img-127\" src=\"../../imgs/lets-review.png\" /> </p> <div class=\"stem-cont\" id=\"loma311-ch13-question-8-label\"> <p class=\"q-stem\" id=\"loma311-ch13-p-203\">True/False: A claimant who disagrees with an insurer’s claim decision may file against the insurer a civil action alleging that by refusing to pay life insurance policy proceeds the insurer breached the contract.

From an insurer’s perspective, performance of an annuity contract is generally not a complicated task. The insurer simply follows the contract owner’s instructions as to who receives the benefits. In most cases, the contract owner and the payee are the same person. Contract owners also select when and how payees will receive annuity payments. Typically, computerized systems track contract values as well as the timing and amounts of annuity payments, and most of the time insurers use standard procedures to administer annuity claims.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-5\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch14-h3-1\">Payout Options</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-18\">One of an insurer’s most important responsibilities regarding performance of an annuity contract is to ensure that annuity payments are disbursed according to the payout option. Annuity contracts contain several different <em>payout options</em>, also called <em>settlement options</em>, from which the contract owner may select. When choosing payout options, contract owners usually consider factors such as how long they want periodic annuity payments to be made and the income tax advantages associated with various options.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-19\">Many contract owners select <em>annuitized</em> payout options, which tie annuity payments to the life expectancy of a named person, known as an <em>annuitant</em>. The most common annuitized payout options are:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch14-ul-5\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-18\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-20\"><em>Straight life annuity</em>: Payments continue for the lifetime of the annuitant and cease at the annuitant’s death.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-19\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-21\"><em>Joint and survivor life annuity</em>: Payments are made to two or more annuitants; the payments continue for the lifetime of the last surviving annuitant and cease at the death of the last surviving annuitant. The annuity amount may change upon the death of an annuitant other than the last surviving annuitant.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-20\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-22\"><em>Life annuity with period certain</em>: Payments continue for the lifetime of the annuitant or for a certain period specified in the contract, whichever is longer. If the annuitant dies before the end of the period certain, the insurer makes payments to a beneficiary for the remainder of the period certain.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-21\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-23\"><em>Life with refund annuity</em>: Payments continue for the lifetime of the annuitant; if the annuitant dies before the payee receives payments that total at least the purchase price of the annuity, the insurer refunds to the payee or a beneficiary named by the contract owner the difference between the purchase price and the amount that has been paid out.</p> </li> </ul> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-6\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch14-h3-2\">Structured Settlements</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-24\">Sometimes annuities are purchased as a result of a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-structuredsettlement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-6\" role=\"doc-glossref\">structured settlement</span>, which is a settlement of a civil dispute or lawsuit in which a party agrees to make periodic payments to a specified payee for a specified period of time. Structured settlements usually result from out-of-court negotiations between a plaintiff and a defendant and their respective attorneys. These settlement agreements are entered into most often by parties involved in personal injury lawsuits.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-25\">After the parties agree on the terms, the settlement agreement is incorporated into the trial court’s judgment. Only the person specified in the structured settlement agreement as the payee can be named as a payee on periodic payment checks, and periodic payments cannot be accelerated or increased. Because the terms of the settlement agreement are put into a court order, that order must be followed. Any changes must be approved by the court. In the United States, periodic payments received by a payee from a structured settlement usually are not subject to federal income tax.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-26\">Each structured settlement agreement is designed to meet the unique needs of the plaintiff. The payee who receives payments under a structured settlement can be the plaintiff or another person. Thus, a structured settlement can require a defendant to make payments to someone other than the person who was directly harmed by the defendant’s actions.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-7\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-27\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-8\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-28\">A plaintiff filed a personal injury lawsuit against a defendant alleging that the defendant’s reckless driving caused the plaintiff to be paralyzed. To resolve the lawsuit, the defendant and the plaintiff entered into a structured settlement that required the defendant to make periodic payments to an education fund for the plaintiff’s minor children until those children reach the age of 18.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-9\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-1\">Annuity Contracts and Structured Settlements</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-29\">Annuity contracts used to fund structured settlements usually are owned by the defendant or the defendant’s property/casualty insurer. When the structured settlement agreement permits, the defendant or the defendant’s property/casualty insurer can assign payment obligations to a <em>third-party assignment company</em>, often referred to as a <em>factoring company</em>. In such a situation, the assignment company becomes the owner of the annuity. A third-party assignment company typically purchases an annuity contract from an affiliated life insurance company to fund the periodic payments. Assigning payment obligations to a third-party assignment company can be advantageous to all parties because these companies typically have extensive experience in the administration of structured settlements.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-30\">Regardless of who owns the annuity contract, structured settlement agreements typically require the contract owner to irrevocably assign the periodic payments from the annuity contract to the payee specified in the structured settlement agreement. Therefore, the annuity contract owner cannot change the identity of the payee who is entitled to receive periodic payments.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-31\">Because the payee does not own the annuity contract, he cannot sell the contract to another party. However, the payee may assign the periodic payments he receives from a structured settlement to another party. For example, a payee may prefer a discounted lump-sum amount to an income stream, and assign the rights to the periodic payments to a company in exchange for a discounted lump sum. A payee who wishes to assign the periodic payments from a structured settlement agreement to another party must obtain a court order approving the transaction.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-32\">Contract owners who purchase annuities to fund structured settlements do not have the same freedom to select payout options as do other annuity contract purchasers. The terms of the structured settlement agreement determine the payout options available to these contract owners. The insurer that issues the annuity contract is responsible for administering the payments according to the terms of the structured settlement agreement. Typically, this responsibility involves ensuring that the specified payee receives periodic payments when they are due.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch14-question-2-wrap\"> <div

The insurer performs its contractual promise when it pays the policy proceeds.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-40\">In performing its contractual obligations, an insurer carefully evaluates each claim to ensure that it pays the policy proceeds to the correct person according to the terms of the life insurance contract. In certain situations, an insurer may deny a claim and refuse to pay policy proceeds if the terms of the contract require such an action. In all cases, insurers review all relevant information before approving or denying a claim.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-16\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch14-h3-3\">Standard Claim Procedures</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-41\">Insurers establish standard claim procedures that employees follow when processing life insurance claims. These procedures are designed to verify the validity of all claims. Standard claim procedures for most insurers include the following tasks:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch14-ul-6\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-22\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-42\">Determine whether the policy is in force</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-23\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-43\">Verify the identity of the insured</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-24\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-44\">Verify that a loss has occurred</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-25\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-45\">Verify that the loss is covered by the policy</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-26\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-46\">Verify the identity of the beneficiary</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-47\">Although insurers take steps to avoid paying claims that are not valid, an insurer cannot unduly delay payment of a claim. As we saw in Chapter 8, laws based on the NAIC Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act require insurers to establish reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims. Similarly, most jurisdictions around the world require prompt payment of valid claims, often within a specified number of days of receiving valid proof of loss.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-17\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-2\">Proof of Loss</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-48\">A person who files a claim for life insurance policy proceeds must give the insurer proof of that claim—called <em>proof of death</em> or <em>proof of loss</em>—by providing evidence that the insured person has died. Acceptable evidence of an insured’s death varies among jurisdictions.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-49\">In the United States, most insurers require claimants to submit a <em>certified death certificate</em>, also called an <em>official death certificate</em>, as proof that the insured has died. Some insurers also accept an Attending Physician’s Statement. Insurers in other countries may require claimants to submit more extensive information, or they may accept other forms of documentation as proof of a claim.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-18\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-3\">Proper Payee</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-50\">After determining that a claim is valid, the insurer must identify the proper payee of policy proceeds, or the insurer risks being subjected to multiple claims. If the insurer pays policy proceeds to a payee who is not entitled to them, the proper payee can later assert a valid claim to the proceeds, and the insurer will be obligated to pay the claim again. In this case, the insurer can seek to recover from the wrong payee the amount paid in error. However, pursuing repayment can be difficult and costly for an insurer.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-19\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-51\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-20\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-52\">The ABC Insurance Company paid Cindy Albert the $100,000 proceeds of a life insurance policy, Three months later, ABC received a claim for those proceeds from Stanley Albert. If ABC determines that Stanley Albert is in fact the proper payee, ABC will be liable to pay him the $100,000. Then ABC will have a cause of action against Cindy Albert to recover the $100,000 it mistakenly paid her.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-53\">For most claims, the identity of the proper payee is clear, and the insurer is able to pay policy proceeds to a named beneficiary. Some claims, however, require an insurer to conduct an investigation to determine the proper payee of policy proceeds. In the following sections, we describe three situations that require further investigation by the insurer: conflicting claimants, common disasters, and short-term survivorship.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-54\"><strong>Conflicting Claimants</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-55\">Sometimes, two or more claimants assert a right to life insurance policy proceeds. For example, both a beneficiary and an assignee might assert a claim to the policy proceeds. Insurers usually settle these types of claims by encouraging the claimants to agree on how the proceeds should be divided. For some claims, however, claimants are unable to agree.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-56\">As we saw in Chapter 13, <em>interpleader</em> is a court proceeding under which an insurer that cannot determine the proper recipient of policy proceeds pays the proceeds to a court and asks the court to decide the proper recipient. The court, not the insurer, determines who is entitled to the proceeds. After paying the money into the court, the insurer usually is released from any further liability under the insurance contract.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-57\"><strong>Common Disasters</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-58\">Sometimes an insured and the primary beneficiary die as a result of a common disaster, such as an automobile accident or a plane crash. In such cases, the insurer must determine whether the beneficiary survived the insured. A primary beneficiary is entitled to receive policy proceeds only if she survived the insured.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-59\">In the United States, when the insurer cannot determine whether the insured or the primary beneficiary died first, most states have a simultaneous death act that provides a reasonable solution. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-simultaneousdeathact\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-11\" role=\"doc-glossref\">simultaneous death act</span> states that if the insured and beneficiary die at the same time or under circumstances that make it impossible to determine which of them died first, then the insured is deemed to have survived the beneficiary. Unless the policy states otherwise, policy proceeds are payable as though the insured outlived the beneficiary.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-21\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-60\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-22\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-61\">Mike and Amy Dare each had life insurance coverage. The state where they lived had a simultaneous death act. The Dares died in a plane crash, but evidence did not show who died first. Therefore, the state’s simultaneous death act determines how policy proceeds are paid.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-62\"><strong>Analysis of Mr. Dare’s policy. </strong>Mr. Dare was the policyowner-insured of a life insurance policy that named Mrs. Dare as the primary beneficiary and their daughter, Edna, as the contingent beneficiary. Mr. Dare, the insured, is deemed to have survived the primary beneficiary, Mrs. Dare. The policy proceeds are payable to Edna, the contingent beneficiary of the policy.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-63\"><strong>Analysis of Mrs. Dare’s policy.</strong> Mrs. Dare was the policyowner-insured of a life insurance policy that named Mr. Dare as the primary beneficiary. Her policy did not name a contingent beneficiary and did not include a survivorship clause. Mrs. Dare, the insured, is deemed to have survived the primary beneficiary, Mr. Dare. Because Mrs. Dare’s policy did not name a contingent beneficiary, the policy proceeds are payable to her estate.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-64\"><strong>Short-Term Survivorship</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-65\">Simultaneous death acts govern situations in which an insurer cannot determine if the primary beneficiary outlived the insured. However, sometimes a beneficiary survives the insured for a short period of time, called <em>short-term survivorship</em>, and the right to receive the life insurance policy proceeds vests in the beneficiary at the insured’s death. If the beneficiary dies before receiving the policy proceeds, then the insurer must pay the proceeds to the beneficiary’s estate. This situation can cause policy proceeds to be paid in a manner contrary to what the policyowner intended.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-66\">To prevent such a result, life insurance policies may contain a survivorship clause, as we saw in Chapter 11. This clause requires the beneficiary to survive the insured by a stated period of time, usually 30 or 60 days, to be entitled to receive the policy proceeds. If the beneficiary does not survive for the stated period of time, the insurer pays the proceeds as if the insured outlived the beneficiary. When a policy includes a survivorship clause, the insurer must delay paying a death claim until the required survivorship period has expired (or the beneficiary dies, if earlier). Thus, for example, if a policy requires the beneficiary to survive the insured by at least 30 days, then the insurer must wait until the earlier of the end of the specified 30-day period or the death of the beneficiary before paying the policy proceeds. Video 14.1 shows the effect of a survivorship clause.</p> <div class=\"figure numbered-fig\" id=\"video14-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-67\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-12\">Video 14.1</span> Example of a Survivorship Clause</p> <div class=\"video-container\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-23\"> <div class=\"v-title-overlay\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-24\"> <p class=\"v-title\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-68\">Example of a Survivorship Clause</p> </div> <video controls=\"controls\" epub:type=\"learning-resource\"> <source src=\"../../video/14-1video.mp4\" />Sorry, it appears your system either does not support video playback or cannot play the MP4 format provided.

Sometimes, however, an insurer must conduct an extensive investigation to determine the validity of a claim. When handling these special claim situations, insurers need to determine critical factors, such as whether to pay the claim, who should receive policy proceeds, and the amount of proceeds to be paid. In the following sections, we discuss some of the situations in which insurers closely examine claims before paying policy proceeds.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-73\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-5\">Detecting Fraud</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-104\">Insurers train their staff to spot signs of potentially fraudulent claims. An unusual claim does not indicate fraud. However, such a claim may warrant more investigation before the claim can be approved. As we saw in Chapter 8, almost all states have regulations governing the handling and reporting of insurance fraud, and some states require insurers to develop a fraud plan to more effectively recognize fraudulent claims.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-74\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-6\">Policy Exclusions</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-105\">Most life insurance policies contain exclusions. An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-exclusion\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-31\" role=\"doc-glossref\">exclusion</span> is a provision that specifies certain situations under which the insurer will not pay the policy’s face amount. If the cause of an insured’s death was excluded from coverage, then the insurer has no contractual liability to pay the full policy death benefit. Policies typically state that the insurer’s liability is limited to the amount of premiums paid for the policy. Sometimes a policy provides that the insurer will be liable only for the policy’s cash surrender value.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-106\">In the past, during periods of war, insurers sometimes included a war exclusion in life insurance policies. A <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-warexclusionprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-32\" role=\"doc-glossref\">war exclusion provision</span> states that an insurer will not pay the full policy proceeds if an insured’s death is caused by war-related activities. U.S. insurers, however, rarely add war exclusions to modern-day life insurance policies, and insurers often do not enforce such clauses found in older policies.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-107\">Another type of exclusion, the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-aviationexclusionprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-33\" role=\"doc-glossref\">aviation exclusion provision</span>, states that an insurer will not pay the policy face amount if the insured’s death is caused by certain aviation-related activities. Insurers usually add these exclusions to policies that insure people involved in military or experimental aviation activities and to those employed by airlines as pilots and flight attendants. Aviation exclusions typically do not exclude coverage for passenger travel on regularly scheduled commercial airlines.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-108\"><strong>Suicide Exclusion</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-109\">The most common policy exclusion is the <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-suicideexclusionprovision\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-34\" role=\"doc-glossref\">suicide exclusion provision</span>, which states that the insurer will not pay the policy face amount if the insured dies as a result of suicide within a stated period of time after the date that the policy was issued. Laws in most states limit the length of the suicide exclusion period to a specified maximum, usually two years.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-110\">According to the terms of a typical suicide exclusion provision, if the insured dies as a result of suicide during the suicide exclusion period, the insurer is not liable to pay the policy face amount. Instead, the insurer’s liability is limited to a return of any premiums paid for the policy minus any unpaid policy loans. After the expiration of the suicide exclusion period, the death of the insured as a result of suicide is covered by the policy and the insurer must pay the full policy benefit.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-111\">The suicide exclusion is intended to guard against antiselection, which, as we have seen, is the tendency for people who are most likely to have claims to be the ones most likely to apply for insurance. The general opinion is that a one- or two-year exclusion period is sufficient to protect the insurer against “planned suicides.” In other words, it is unlikely that a person would purchase life insurance with the intention of committing suicide one or two years later.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-112\">Most jurisdictions have developed a strong presumption against suicide—that is, the law presumes that a person’s death did <em>not</em> result from suicide. If the facts of a case can be interpreted in more than one way, a court usually will presume that the insured did not take his own life.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-113\">When an insurer refuses to pay a policy’s face amount based on the suicide exclusion provision and the claimant later sues the insurer, the insurer has the burden of proving that the insured’s death was caused by suicide during the policy’s suicide exclusion period. An insurer’s assertion that the insured committed suicide is an affirmative defense—that is, it is an allegation of facts that constitutes a defense to a plaintiff’s claim. Whether the insured committed suicide is a question of fact that depends on all of the circumstances surrounding the death.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-114\">Another question of fact that sometimes arises in suicide cases concerns whether an insured was sane when she committed suicide. According to laws in most states, suicide requires that the person must have intended to kill herself; a person who is insane cannot form the necessary intent to commit suicide. As a result, the insurer is liable to pay policy proceeds if the insured died as a result of self-inflicted injury while insane. To avoid this result, the suicide exclusion provision included in most policies indicates that the insurer is not liable to pay the policy proceeds if the insured died as a result of suicide or self-inflicted injury, while <em>sane or insane</em>.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-75\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-7\">Disappearance of the Insured</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-115\">When an insured disappears, a claimant to life insurance policy proceeds cannot provide the insurer with proof that the insured is dead. If a claimant cannot provide acceptable proof of her claim, the insurer will not pay the claim. When this situation occurs in the United States, a claimant can ask a court to declare the insured dead. A court’s willingness to declare a missing person dead often depends on the circumstances surrounding the person’s disappearance.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-116\">When an insured disappears from an identifiable cause under circumstances that suggest he is likely dead, a court usually declares the insured dead. A court typically makes this determination when the insured disappears as a result of a specific peril that can reasonably account for his death.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-76\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-117\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-77\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-118\">Goran Milo was the policyowner-insured of a life insurance policy issued by XYZ Life. Mr. Milo boarded a plane for a direct flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong. Mr. Milo was seen boarding the plane by several airport officials. While in flight to Hong Kong, the plane experienced mechanical failure and crashed. A subsequent investigation revealed no survivors, and Mr. Milo’s body was never recovered. In this situation, the plane crash is an identifiable cause of Mr. Milo’s disappearance, and circumstances suggest that Mr. Milo is likely dead. Thus, a court is likely to enter an order declaring that Mr. Milo is dead, and XYZ Life will pay the claim.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-119\">When the insured’s disappearance cannot be attributed to an identifiable cause, the claimant has the burden of proving that the insured has died. Most states have laws that require a claimant to prove all of the following facts:</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch14-ul-9\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-49\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-120\">The insured has been missing continuously for a specified period of time—five or seven years in most jurisdictions.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-50\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-121\">The insured’s absence is unexplained.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-51\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-122\">A reasonable search for the insured has taken place.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-52\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-123\">No one has had communication with the insured since his disappearance.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-124\">If a claimant satisfactorily proves the required facts, a court will presume that the insured is dead. In most jurisdictions, a court’s presumption of death is a <em>rebuttable presumption</em>, which is a presumption that can be disproven but that stands until adequate evidence is presented to the contrary. Therefore, a party wishing to show that the insured is not dead is allowed to present evidence to the court to prove that fact. If a court’s presumption of death is rebutted, the insured’s status becomes a question of fact.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-125\">See Figure 14.1 for an example of a life insurance claim in which the insured’s disappearance cannot be attributed to an identifiable cause.</p> <figure class=\"figure numbered-fig\" data-mwidth=\"max-width:715px;\" id=\"figure14-1\"> <p class=\"title\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-126\"><span class=\"fig-num\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-35\">Figure 14.1</span> Proving an Insured Has Died</p> <img alt=\"Proving an Insured Has Died\" id=\"loma311-ch14-img-98\" src=\"../../imgs/14-1figure.jpg\" /> <figcaption> <div class=\"img-desc hidden\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-78\"><span class=\"id-button\" data-description=\"figure14-1\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-36\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Image Description</span> </div> <div class=\"static-img-desc visible\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-79\"><a class=\"img-description\" epub:type=\"noteref\" href=\"../raw/descriptions.xhtml#figure14-1\" id=\"loma311-ch14-a-14\" role=\"doc-noteref\">Figure 14-1 Description</a> </div> </figcaption> </figure> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-127\">When a court declares an insured to be dead, a court order serves as proof of death, and policy proceeds become payable. Many times, the court order specifies the date on which the insured is presumed to have died. When the court order does not specify the date of death for the insured, the insured is presumed to have died on the date of the court order.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-128\">Note that when an insured disappears, the contract owner or another interested party, such as the beneficiary, must keep the policy in force until the court issues an order declaring the insured dead. Therefore, premiums must be paid or the policy must be continued under a nonforfeiture option such as the extended term insurance option. If the policy lapses for nonpayment of premiums <em>before the date of the court order</em>, the insurer is not liable to pay the policy proceeds.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-129\">Sometimes an insured who has been declared dead by a court reappears. If an insurer paid a claim and the insured later reappears, the insurer generally is entitled to recover the amount it paid under the claim because the insurer paid the claim as the result of a mistake of fact. The insurer, however, may be prevented from recovering such a mistaken payment if it paid less than the full amount of policy proceeds as part of a compromise settlement with the beneficiary. We describe compromise settlements later in the chapter.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-80\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-8\">Disqualification of the Beneficiary</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-130\">When a beneficiary designation is clear, an insurer pays life insurance proceeds to the proper recipient as promptly as possible. Sometimes, however, a beneficiary is disqualified from receiving policy proceeds because the beneficiary is responsible or alleged to be responsible for the death of the insured. In the United States and in most common law jurisdictions, laws exist to prevent individuals from profiting from a criminal act. When a beneficiary causes the death of the insured, the insurer must determine if the claim should be paid and, if so, to whom.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-131\">A beneficiary who is convicted of wrongfully killing an insured in a <em>criminal or civil court </em>typically is disqualified from receiving policy proceeds. Jurisdictions vary as to what type of wrongful killing results in disqualification.</p> <ul class=\"list\" id=\"loma311-ch14-ul-10\"> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-53\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-132\">In most jurisdictions, any person convicted in a criminal proceeding of murdering the insured is disqualified from receiving life insurance policy proceeds.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-54\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-133\">In some jurisdictions, a person convicted in a criminal proceeding of wrongfully killing the insured by means of murder or a lesser offense, such as manslaughter, also is disqualified from receiving life insurance policy proceeds.</p> </li> <li id=\"loma311-ch14-li-55\"> <p id=\"loma311-ch14-p-134\">A person does not have to be convicted of a crime in a criminal court to be disqualified as a beneficiary. If a civil court finds that an individual wrongfully caused the insured’s death, then that individual is disqualified from receiving life insurance policy proceeds.</p> </li> </ul> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-135\">As we saw in Chapter 13, even when a beneficiary is disqualified, the insurer usually must pay the policy proceeds to a contingent beneficiary or to the policyowner-insured’s estate. This general rule, however, does not apply if a beneficiary obtained a life insurance policy with the intent of causing the insured’s death. In this case, the contract is void from its inception. Thus, the insurer is not liable to pay policy proceeds and is responsible only for returning policy premiums—plus any interest, less any outstanding policy loans and unpaid interest on those loans—to the policyowner or the policyowner’s estate. In such a case, the insurer bears the burden of proving that the policy was purchased with the intent to cause the insured’s death.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-81\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-9\">Accidental Death Benefits</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-136\">An <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-accidentaldeathbenefit\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-37\" role=\"doc-glossref\">accidental death benefit</span> is a supplemental life insurance policy benefit that requires the insurer to pay a specified amount of money in addition to the policy’s basic death benefit if an insured dies as a result of an accident. When a life insurance policy contains an accidental death benefit, the insurer must evaluate the cause of the insured’s death to determine whether the accidental death benefit is payable.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-137\">When a claim is made for accidental death benefits, the insurer usually requires the claimant to submit additional information to show proof of the claim. For example, an insurer may require a claimant to provide an autopsy report in addition to a death certificate. The insurer uses this additional information to determine whether the insured’s death was <em>accidental</em> as defined by the terms of the life insurance policy. A typical definition of <em>accidental death</em> found in many life insurance policies reads as follows:</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-82\"> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-83\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-138\"><strong>Accidental Death.</strong> Death resulting, directly and independently of all other causes, from accidental bodily injury.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-139\">When a claimant sues an insurer over the denial of accidental death benefits, the claimant has the burden of proving that the insured’s death was caused by an accident. Whether the insured’s death was caused by an accident is a question of fact.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-140\">Some life insurance policies contain a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-timelimitationclause\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-38\" role=\"doc-glossref\">time limitation clause</span> that specifies that the insured’s death must occur within a certain period of time—usually 90 or 180 days—from the date of an accident for accidental death benefits to be payable. The purpose of a time limitation clause is to ensure to a reasonable degree that the accident was the cause of the insured’s death.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-141\">Most contracts also contain accidental death benefit exclusions, which state that if an insured dies as a result of certain specified causes, the insurer is not required to pay accidental death benefits. An example of such a cause might be a drug overdose or an accident that occurs while a person is under the influence of drugs or alcohol. As a general rule, the insurer has the burden of proving that the insured died as a result of a cause excluded from coverage.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-84\">&#160;</div> <h3 id=\"loma311-ch14-h3-5\">Claim Litigation</h3> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-142\">Insurers try to avoid litigation because it is time-consuming and costly. When an insurer is involved in claim litigation, the insurer’s attorneys spend a great deal of time gathering evidence to justify the denial of the claim. Other employees of the insurer spend time gathering pertinent documents and information requested by the legal staff. In some cases, claim litigation may require employees who were involved in the claim decision to give depositions. In other cases, an employee may be called to testify at a trial. In cases such as these, a claimant may want to prove that there was an error in the process or that inappropriate considerations were applied.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-143\">Often, insurers must hire outside attorneys to assist with claim litigation. Depending on the length and complexity of a trial, attorneys’ fees can be a significant expense for an insurer. Because of the many potential drawbacks of litigation, insurers often try to reach a compromise with potential plaintiffs as a way to avoid litigation.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-85\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-10\">Compromise Settlements</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-144\">Sometimes insurers and claimants do not agree on the amount of policy proceeds that should be paid for a claim. Accidental death benefits in particular often cause disputes between insurers and claimants regarding the total amount of policy proceeds for which an insurer is liable. Insurers sometimes seek to settle a claim dispute through a <span class=\"gt\" data-term=\"ch14-gt-compromisesettlement\" epub:type=\"glossref\" id=\"loma311-ch14-span-39\" role=\"doc-glossref\">compromise settlement</span>, which is an agreement between two or more parties to settle a dispute regarding the terms and/or performance of a contract.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-86\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-145\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-87\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-146\">A life insurance policy contained a $200,000 accidental death benefit. The insured died, and the insurer concluded that the beneficiary’s claim for the basic death benefit was valid. The insurer, however, could not clearly determine whether the insured’s death resulted from an accident or other intervening causes. Rather than completely denying the claim for accidental death benefits, the insurer entered into a compromise settlement with the beneficiary under which the insurer paid the beneficiary the basic death benefit plus $100,000 (rather than $200,000) in accidental death benefits. The insurer’s liability under the contract was discharged when it paid the agreed-upon amount to the beneficiary.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-147\">Most insurers are willing to enter into compromise settlements because they want to avoid the possibility of paying a large damage award if the claimant files a successful lawsuit. Damage awards can decrease an insurer’s profits and weaken its reputation.</p> <p class=\"txt\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-148\">When a claim is paid under a compromise settlement, the insurer cannot demand repayment of the amount it paid in settlement of the claim. For example, suppose an insurer entered into a compromise settlement with a claimant but later discovered facts indicating that the claim should not have been paid. In the absence of fraud, the insurer cannot recover the amount it paid because the courts will not disturb such a compromise settlement entered into by competent parties.</p> <div class=\"clearfix\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-88\">&#160;</div> <h4 id=\"loma311-ch14-h4-11\">Litigation</h4> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-149\">A claimant who disagrees with an insurer’s decision to deny a claim for life insurance policy proceeds may file a civil action against the insurer alleging that the insurer breached the contract.</p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-150\"><strong>Conflict of Laws</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-151\">Actions involving life insurance policies often involve the laws of multiple jurisdictions. As we saw in Chapter 4, conflict of law rules are used to determine which substantive laws apply to the issues in a civil lawsuit when the laws of more than one jurisdiction are involved in the lawsuit.</p> <div class=\"example\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-89\"> <p class=\"example-header\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-152\">EXAMPLE</p> <div class=\"inner\" id=\"loma311-ch14-div-90\"> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-153\">A civil lawsuit was filed in a court in State A. The lawsuit involved a policy that insured a person who resided in State B at the time of his death. The policy was issued by an insurer domiciled in State C to a policyowner who resided in State A. The court must apply conflict of laws rules to determine which state’s substantive laws are to be applied to decide the issues in dispute.</p> </div> </div> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-154\"><strong>Damages</strong> </p> <p class=\"txt-ni\" id=\"loma311-ch14-p-155\">As we saw in Chapter 13, if a court rules that the insurer breached the contract, the court typically orders the insurer to pay compensatory damages. For a claimant to life insurance policy proceeds, this usually is the amount of policy proceeds payable by the insurer. Furthermore, in many jurisdictions, an insurer found to have acted in bad faith may be liable for punitive damages, in addition to compensatory damages, and the plaintiff may recover damages that exceed the amount of the policy’s basic death benefit and supplemental benefits.</p> <div class=\"question-wrapper\" id=\"loma311-ch14-question-6-wrap\"> <div class=\"question-container hidden\"
