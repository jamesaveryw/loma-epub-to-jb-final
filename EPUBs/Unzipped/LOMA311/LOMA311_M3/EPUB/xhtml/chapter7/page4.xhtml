            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-42">As we saw in Chapter 1, governmental powers typically are divided among
                three branches of government. In the United States, the states divide authority
                for insurance as follows:</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-7">
                <li id="loma311-ch7-li-34">
                    <p id="loma311-ch7-p-43"><strong>Legislative.</strong> The state <em>legislature</em> enacts and modifies
                        statutes to regulate the activities of insurers. These statutes are found
                        in the state insurance code, which is updated periodically.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch7-li-35">
                    <p id="loma311-ch7-p-44"><strong>Executive.</strong> The state <em>insurance department</em> adopts
                        regulations that fill in the details of insurance statutes. The insurance
                        department also enforces statutes and regulations and oversees the operations
                        of all insurers that operate in the state. The state <em>attorney general</em> writes
                        opinions that interpret state laws or regulations. The attorney general
                        writes opinions upon the request of legislators, state officials, private
                        persons, or businesses. Although <em>attorney general opinions</em> do not
                        have the same force of law as statutes, regulations, or court decisions,
                        state officials usually follow these opinions.</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch7-li-36">
                    <p id="loma311-ch7-p-45"><strong>Judicial.</strong> The state <em>courts</em> generally have authority
                        to interpret an insurance law’s meaning when application of the law to
                        a specific situation is not clear.</p>

                            to make sure that insurers are financially able to meet their debts and
                            pay policy benefits when they come due. Solvency laws affect an insurer’s
                            capitalization, policy design, and policy reserves.</p>

                            enacted to make sure that insurers conduct business fairly and ethically.
                            Market conduct laws set mandated benefits and regulate most of the nonfinancial
                            operations of insurers, such as management, marketing and advertising,
                            sales, underwriting, policyowner service, complaint handling, agent licensing,

                    laws, the states enact laws that require the state insurance department
                    to periodically examine the condition and affairs of insurers that operate
                    in the state. Insurance departments conduct two types of examinations:
                    financial condition examinations and market conduct examinations.</p>

                            a formal investigation that is designed to identify and monitor threats
                            to an insurer’s solvency. These examinations may be carried out by one
                            or more state insurance departments. Statutes typically require an examination
                            of each insurer within a specified period of time. State insurance departments
                            also have authority to conduct more frequent examinations if needed. States
                            conduct two types of financial condition examinations. A <em>full-scope examination</em> reports
                            on an insurer’s financial position taken as a whole. A <em>limited-scope examination</em> focuses
                            on one or more specific areas of an insurer’s finances, such as its reserves
                            or its ability to pay claims. We discuss financial condition examinations
                            in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

                            a formal investigation of an insurer’s nonfinancial operations. A market

                            applicable laws and regulations. Like financial condition examinations,
                            a market conduct examination may be carried out by one or more state insurance
                            departments. We discuss market conduct laws and examinations in Chapter
                            8.</p>

                        and regulations focus on licensing requirements, reporting and filing requirements,
                        and the right to take action.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-55">As we saw in Chapter 3, state insurance laws require <em>insurers</em> to
                        obtain a license in each jurisdiction where they do business. Similarly,
                        state insurance laws require <em>individuals who market and sell insurance</em> to
                        obtain a license in each jurisdiction where they do business. We discuss
                        insurance agent licensing in Chapter 8.</p>

                            of insurance later in this chapter.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-57">Insurers generally must file their Annual Statements by March 1 each year.
                        The Annual Statement must reflect that the insurer has met all the financial
                        requirements of the state insurance laws. Most states require companies
                        to file shorter versions of these reports quarterly as well.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma311-ch7-p-58">States also require insurers to file other types of reports and materials,
                        such as insurance policy forms. Insurers typically create standard policy
                        forms for each life and annuity product they sell. As a general rule, before
                        issuing or delivering a policy form in a state, an insurer submits the
                        form to the insurance department for approval. We discuss state filing
                        requirements in more detail in Chapter 8.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-59">State insurance department actions may result from periodic examinations
                        or complaints from the public. Insurance departments have the authority
                        to take action when they find that an insurer is in financial difficulty
                        or is not complying with regulatory requirements. Likewise, insurance departments
                        have the authority to take action against insurance agents who fail to
                        comply with state insurance laws.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-60">Typically, an insurer found to be in violation of state insurance laws
                        must pay a fine. In more serious cases, the insurance department may <em>suspend</em> or <em>revoke</em> the
                        insurer’s certificate of authority.</p>
                    <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-10">

                            <p id="loma311-ch7-p-61">If the insurance department <em>suspends</em> the insurer’s certificate
                                of authority, the insurer must cease operating. The insurance department
                                may impose a suspension for a stated period of time or until the insurer
                                corrects the violation.</p>

                                authority, the certificate is no longer valid. The insurer cannot conduct
                                business in the state until the insurance department issues a new certificate
                                of authority.</p>

                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-63">A state insurance department, for instance, may suspend or revoke an insurance
                        company’s certificate if the insurer is financially unsound or knowingly
                        fails to comply with state laws, regulations, or an order issued by the
                        department. An insurance department also may suspend or revoke the license
                        of an insurance agent.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-64">The state insurance department may not take action against an insurer

                        An individual, known as an <em>administrative law judge</em>, conducts the
                        hearing. The administrative law judge has the authority to hear testimony
                        and decide questions of law and fact. The insurance department must give
                        the insurer proper notice of the hearing.</p>

                        to model laws and regulations in one of the following ways: (1) they may
                        adopt the model exactly as written, (2) they may use the model as the basis
                        for developing legislation or regulation, or (3) they may ignore the model.
                        However, for a state’s insurance department to maintain accreditation with
                        the NAIC, the department must have adequate statutory and administrative
                        authority to regulate an insurer’s corporate and financial affairs. This
                        authority is established in part by the adoption of model solvency laws.</p>

                    class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-71">The NAIC provides a forum for state insurance department staff to discuss
                        regulatory policy issues and develop national policy on certain issues.
                        The NAIC assigns responsibility for studying such issues to membership
                        committees. These committees receive information from many sources, such
                        as legislators, insurance regulators, insurers, industry groups, and consumer
                        groups. Committees then make recommendations to the NAIC Executive Committee.
                        A recommendation may entail, for instance, adoption of a model law. A recommendation
                        is adopted only if approved by the NAIC Executive Committee.</p>

                        id="loma311-ch7-p-72">The NAIC also provides services for state insurance regulators. These
                            services help the states coordinate their oversight activities and avoid
                            duplication of effort and conflicting rules. The NAIC provides several
                            computerized databases to insurance departments. These databases, for example,
                            enable the departments to simplify the licensing process for insurance
                            agents, screen insurers that apply for a certificate of authority, and
                            exchange information about licensed insurers and insurance agents.</p>

                            departments to schedule and coordinate on-site examinations of insurers.
                            Also, the NAIC maintains a financial database containing information from
                            insurers’ Annual Statements and assists state insurance departments in
                            overseeing the solvency of insurers. We discuss these activities later

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-100">In each state, solvency laws apply to insurers that operate within the
                                state. These laws impose requirements on an insurer’s reserves, assets,
                                investments, capital, and surplus. If an insurer becomes financially unsound,
                                regulators may monitor the insurer. Regulators also have the authority
                                to take action to protect the public interest. The insight below provides
                                additional information for our discussion of solvency requirements.</p>

                                        what the company owns (assets), what the company owes (liabilities), and

                                                of assets are cash and investments.</li>
                                            <li id="loma311-ch7-li-52"><em>Liabilities</em> are the company’s debts and future obligations. Most
                                                of an insurer’s liabilities consist of reserves, that is, the company’s
                                                need to pay policy benefits as they come due.</li>
                                            <li id="loma311-ch7-li-53"><em>Owners’ equity</em> is the difference between the company’s assets
                                                and liabilities. It represents the owners’ financial interest in the company.
                                                Owners’ equity consists of capital and surplus. Capital represents investments
                                                by owners, usually through the purchase of the company’s stock. Surplus
                                                represents the total net profits earned from a company’s operations and
                                                left to accumulate. Because mutual and fraternal insurers do not issue
                                                stock, they have a balance only in their surplus account; this balance
                                                is sometimes called <em>policyholder surplus</em>.</li>

                                        the question, “As of this date, how solvent is the insurer?” The relationship
                                        between the various components of a balance sheet are measures of a company’s
                                        solvency. For instance, a company with too little capital and surplus compared
                                        to its liabilities may come under regulatory supervision.</p>

                                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-107">State insurance laws apply reserve requirements for life insurance and
                                    annuity policies. These laws for reserve requirements, which are based
                                    on the <em>NAIC Standard Valuation Law</em>, are fairly uniform across the
                                    United States. The laws impose minimum requirements on the size of policy
                                    reserves by establishing guidelines that insurers must apply to calculate
                                    their reserves.</p>
                                <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-108">State solvency requirements specify that an insurer must maintain assets
                                    that are at least equal to the amount of its policy reserve liabilities
                                    plus capital and surplus. Most insurers maintain reserves much larger than
                                    the minimum amount required by the states. Insurers acquire assets by investing
                                    the premiums they receive. They report the value of their assets on the
                                    Annual Statements they file with state regulators and the NAIC.</p>

                                id="loma311-ch7-p-109">The states define which assets an insurer may include on its Annual Statement.
                                    The assets that an insurer may report as statutory assets are known as <em>admitted assets</em>.
                                    All other assets are known as <em>nonadmitted assets</em>. An insurer must
                                    report nonadmitted assets, such as furniture and fixtures, separately and
                                    may not use them to support its required reserves. The admitted assets
                                    held by U.S. life and health insurers primarily consist of corporate stocks
                                    and bonds, government securities, mortgages, and real estate.</p>

                                id="loma311-ch7-p-110">Solvency laws also govern how insurers determine the value of their assets
                                    for statutory reporting. These valuation requirements make sure that all
                                    insurers use the same standards in the asset valuation process and that
                                    valuations are accurate.</p>

                                        is on insurer solvency. The state insurance departments have access to
                                        a database maintained by the NAIC that stores most of the financial information

                                                    examination. Among other things, the Lead State maintains a coordination

                                                    all the examinations. In addition, the Lead State names an <em>Exam Facilitator</em> for
                                                    each examination. Often, the Exam Facilitator is the Lead State, but depending
                                                    on the circumstances, another participating state may be the Exam Facilitator.
                                                    Typically, the Exam Facilitator’s chief examiner is the designated contact
