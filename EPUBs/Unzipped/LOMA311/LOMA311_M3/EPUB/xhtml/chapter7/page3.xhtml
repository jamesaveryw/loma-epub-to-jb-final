            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch7-h2-4">U.S. Federal and State Regulation</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-37">In the United States, insurance companies are subject to <em>dual regulation</em>;
                in other words, the states and the federal government each play a role
                in regulating insurance.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-38">As we saw in Chapter 1, the U.S. Constitution gives specific powers to
                the federal government. All powers not given to the federal government
                are left to the states. When Congress enacts a federal law within its power,
                the law preempts any conflicting state laws on the subject. <span class="gt"
                data-term="ch7-gt-preemption" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-9"
                role="doc-glossref">Preemption</span> is a legal doctrine that holds that
                some matters are of such national importance that the federal laws override—or <em>preempt</em>—any
                conflicting state laws. The states cannot pass laws that are inconsistent
                with such federal laws.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-39">One of the powers the Constitution gives to the federal government is
                the power to regulate <em>interstate </em>commerce, which is commerce <em>across state lines</em>.
                The states, on the other hand, have the power to regulate <em>intrastate</em> commerce,
                which is commerce <em>within a state</em>. Because insurers typically conduct
                business across state lines, the federal government has authority to regulate
                insurance activities.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-40">The federal <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-mccarranfergusonact" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma311-ch7-span-10" role="doc-glossref">McCarran-Ferguson Act</span>,
                however, gives the states primary authority to regulate insurance as long
                as Congress finds such state regulation to be adequate. According to the
                McCarran-Ferguson Act, the regulation of insurance by the states is in
                the public interest. But Congress retains the right to enact insurance
                legislation if it decides that state regulation is inadequate or not in
                the public interest.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-41">Furthermore, although the states have primary authority to regulate insurance,
                a number of insurance products have features that also make them securities.
                Because securities are subject to federal regulation, these products are
                subject to both state and federal regulation.</p>
