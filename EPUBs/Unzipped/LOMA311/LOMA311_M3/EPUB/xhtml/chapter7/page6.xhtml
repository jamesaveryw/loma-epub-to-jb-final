<h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch7-h2-7">Federal Regulation of Insurance Products That Are Securities</h2>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-212">The U.S. federal government has primary authority to regulate the securities industry and the products that qualify as securities. A <em>security</em> is a certificate or electronic record that represents either (1) an ownership interest in a business or (2) an obligation of indebtedness owed by a business, government, or agency. Examples of securities include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, variable life insurance, and variable annuities. Consumers who buy securities may make a profit or incur a loss. These consumers take on a financial risk.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-91">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma311-ch7-h3-13">Insurance Products as Securities</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-213">Insurers place the premiums they receive for life insurance and annuities in either a general account or a separate account.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-214">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-generalaccount" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-71" role="doc-glossref">general account</span> is an undivided asset account that an insurer maintains for the purpose of recording assets that back the reserves for <em>traditional</em> life insurance and <em>fixed</em> annuity products. Regardless of the investment performance of general account assets, the insurer pays the benefit amounts guaranteed by these products. Thus, the <em>insurer</em> takes on the financial risk. To ensure they have the funds on hand to pay the contractually guaranteed benefits, insurers invest their general account assets in relatively secure investments. These investments tend to have a lower rate of return than might be possible with more risky investments.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-215">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-separateaccount" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-72" role="doc-glossref">separate account</span> is an asset account, maintained by an insurer apart from its general account, in which premiums for <em>variable</em> life insurance and <em>variable</em> annuity products are held. The assets in a separate account may be divided among various investment funds or subaccounts. The owner of a variable product selects the subaccount(s) into which the insurer deposits the premiums. Variable products do not guarantee the exact amount of benefits payable, so the <em>policyowner </em>or<em> contract owner</em>, not the insurer, takes on the financial risk of the investments. In a variable life insurance contract the death benefit and cash value of the policy fluctuate according to the investment performance of the subaccount investments. Likewise, in a variable annuity contract the amount of the accumulated value and the amount of periodic annuity benefit payments fluctuate in accordance with the performance of the subaccount investments.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-92">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma311-ch7-h3-14">Regulatory Oversight of Securities</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-216">Because consumers take on the investment risk when they buy an individual variable life insurance or annuity product, the U.S. federal government classifies these products as securities. Accordingly, variable products must comply with federal securities laws as well as state insurance laws.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-217">Note, however, that some individual variable annuity contracts are used to fund group retirement plans. These contracts are exempt from federal securities laws, but they are subject to federal tax laws and employee benefits laws, such as ERISA. The <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-employeeretirementincomesecurityact" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-73" role="doc-glossref">Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</span> is a U.S. federal law designed to ensure that employee pension and welfare benefit plans meet certain minimum requirements to protect covered employees. We discuss employee benefits plans in Chapter 9.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-218">Many consumers use investment products to save for retirement. To encourage retirement saving, federal laws offer income tax advantages for some products. For instance, an <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-individualretirementarrangement" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-74" role="doc-glossref">individual retirement arrangement (IRA)</span> is a type of retirement plan that allows a person with taxable compensation to put a stated amount of compensation into a savings or investment product that meets requirements specified in the federal tax laws, and thus receive favorable federal tax treatment. The tax laws specify which taxpayers are eligible to contribute to an IRA and place maximum limits on the annual contributions a taxpayer may make to an IRA. There are two types of individual retirement arrangements:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-24">

In the United States, more than half of all the money invested in individual annuities is placed in individual retirement annuities.<span class="ens" id="loma311-ch7-span-77"> <span class="endnote hidden" data-note="loma311-ch7-en1" epub:type="noteref" id="loma311-ch7-span-78" role="doc-noteref">1</span> </span></p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-221">Federal securities laws provide a framework for regulatory oversight of the securities industry. This framework includes:</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-226">The <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-securitiesandexchangecommission" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-79" role="doc-glossref">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span> is the federal agency responsible for administering federal securities laws. The SEC has authority to make rules and regulations that govern the purchase and sale of securities. This authority applies to sales that are made publicly through a stock exchange as well as over-the counter sales. A <em>stock exchange</em> is an organized marketplace where specific types of securities, such as bonds and certain types of stocks, are bought and sold by members of the exchange. Sales of stocks that are not traded on a stock exchange are referred to as <em>over-the-counter (OTC) sales</em>. For instance, SEC rules classify variable annuities as securities, and so the sale of a variable annuity is an over-the-counter sale of a security.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-227">However, according to SEC rules, an annuity is <em>not</em> a security and is not subject to federal securities regulation if it meets the following conditions:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-26">
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-107">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-228">The insurer assumes the investment risk of the contract.</p>

	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-108">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-229">The contract is not marketed primarily as an investment.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-109">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-230">The contract is issued by a corporation that is subject to supervision by a state agency or a state officer, such as the insurance commissioner.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-231">SEC rules refer explicitly to annuities, but do not refer to life insurance. However, the SEC’s view is that variable life insurance is also a security. In general, all variable products offered by life insurers—including variable life, variable universal life, and variable annuities—are subject to securities regulation as well as state law. Most indexed annuities, on the other hand, currently are considered insurance products and are not subject to SEC regulation.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-93">&#160;</div>

<h3 id="loma311-ch7-h3-15">Registration Requirements</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-232">Federal securities laws apply registration requirements on individuals and firms that offer securities for sale to the public. These requirements apply to (1) investment companies, (2) individuals and firms that market securities, and (3) securities products.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-94">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma311-ch7-h4-7">Investment Companies</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-233">Investment companies must register with the SEC before they conduct business. An <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-investmentcompany" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-80" role="doc-glossref">investment company</span> is a company that issues securities and engages primarily in investing and trading securities. The basic types of investment companies are</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-27">
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-110">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-234"><em>Open-end investment companies.</em> An open-end investment company is an investment company that establishes a portfolio of securities and issues shares in the portfolio to the public. The investment company will redeem shares upon the owner’s request. Such companies are considered open-end companies because their capitalization is not fixed and they normally issue more shares as people want them. Mutual funds are the primary type of open-end investment company.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-111">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-235"><em>Closed-end investment companies.</em> A closed-end investment company is an investment company that issues a fixed number of shares to the public and does not redeem shares that are outstanding.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-112">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-236"><em>Unit investment trusts.</em> The separate accounts of most life insurers are registered with the SEC as unit investment trusts. These unit investment trusts own and hold assets for the participants in variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. Each separate account may be divided into subaccounts. Each subaccount may invest in a different open-end investment company. The open-end investment companies in which the separate accounts are invested must be registered as investment companies.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-237">The owners of variable life insurance and annuity contracts receive a prospectus for each investment company in which they invest. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-prospectus" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-81" role="doc-glossref">prospectus</span> is a communication, usually in writing, that offers a security for sale and that must contain detailed information about the issuer of the security and the security itself.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-95">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma311-ch7-h4-8">Individuals and Firms That Market Securities</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-238">Registration requirements apply to individuals and firms that market securities. Sales of securities to the public must be conducted by a <em>securities broker</em> or a person who acts as an agent for a securities broker.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-239">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-securitiesbroker" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-82" role="doc-glossref">securities broker</span> is a person, corporation, or other legal entity engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for the accounts of others. Securities brokers often operate as both a securities broker and a securities dealer. A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-securitiesdealer" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-83" role="doc-glossref">securities dealer</span>is a person, corporation, or other legal entity that is engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account. The term <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-brokerdealer" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-84" role="doc-glossref">broker-dealer</span> is often used to refer to individuals and firms that transact securities business.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-240">Brokers and dealers must register with the SEC. They also must become members of the <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-financialindustryregulatoryauthority" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-85" role="doc-glossref">Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)</span>, which is a nonprofit organization of member firms and is responsible for regulating all securities firms doing business in the United States. FINRA is supervised by the SEC.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-241">Any person who is associated with a FINRA member and who engages in the securities business must register with FINRA. This includes partners, officers, directors, branch managers, and salespeople. Generally, two levels of qualification and registration are available:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-28">
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-113">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-242">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-registeredrepresentative" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-86" role="doc-glossref">registered representative</span> is a person who is associated with a FINRA member, engages in the securities business on behalf of the member by soliciting the sale of securities or by training securities salespeople, and has passed the applicable examination administered by FINRA.</p>
	</li>

	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-244">We use the term <em>registered person</em> to refer to both registered representatives and principals. A person who solicits the sale of variable life insurance and/or variable annuities must be registered with FINRA and licensed by the state as an insurance agent.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-96">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma311-ch7-h4-9">Securities Products</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-245">Federal securities laws require a security to be registered with the SEC before it is advertised or offered for sale to the public. Registration of a security does not indicate that the SEC has approved the security or made any judgment as to its merits. Federal laws set strict requirements for the sale of securities. Most such requirements are designed to ensure adequate disclosure to prospective purchasers of material information about the security.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-246">Figure 7.3 highlights the registration requirements we discussed in this section.</p>

<h3 id="loma311-ch7-h3-16">Regulation of the Sale of Securities</h3>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-248">Registered members of FINRA must conduct business in compliance with all statutory requirements and the rules for FINRA members. <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-finrarules" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-90" role="doc-glossref">FINRA Rules</span> impose requirements on how broker-dealers and registered persons must conduct business. Following are some examples:</p>

<ul class="list" id="loma311-ch7-ul-29">
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-115">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-249"><strong>Broker-dealers must establish and maintain a system to supervise the activities of the registered persons who work under their control.</strong> This system must reasonably ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. A principal must directly supervise the activities of each registered representative.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-116">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-250"><strong>Advertisements, sales literature, and correspondence that broker-dealers and registered persons use to communicate with the public must meet certain requirements.</strong> For instance, sales materials must not contain promises of specific investment results. Before advertisements and sales materials are used, a principal must review them. The principal must initial or sign such materials to indicate approval. The broker-dealer must maintain a file and keep materials for at least three years after every use.</p>
	</li>
	<li id="loma311-ch7-li-117">
	<p id="loma311-ch7-p-251"><strong>Broker-dealers must file certain public communication materials with FINRA for review.</strong> During the first year a broker-dealer is a FINRA member, the broker-dealer must submit all such materials to FINRA before use. After the first year, the broker-dealer must submit certain public communications to FINRA within 10 days of their first use.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-252">FINRA also imposes requirements that apply to investment recommendations. At the time of this writing, FINRA required financial professionals to make recommendations that are suitable for the customer. <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-suitability" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-91" role="doc-glossref">Suitability</span> is the principle that the sale of a financial product must be consistent with a customer’s investment objectives and financial situation. Note that the NAIC and some states also have established suitability requirements for variable life insurance and annuities. We discuss state suitability requirements in Chapter 8.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-253">In addition, regulators at both the federal and state level are exploring expanded protections for consumers with regard to investment recommendations, and the regulatory landscape for investment advice continues to evolve, as described in the insight below.</p>

<p class="insight-title" id="loma311-ch7-p-255">Standards for Investment Advice</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-256">The question of whether regulations provide adequate protection for investors has been debated for many years. Recently, the debate has intensified.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-257">As we noted earlier in this chapter, one of the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act is to protect consumers from abusive financial practices. The Dodd-Frank Act provides the legal authority for the SEC to adopt a rule that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers to act in the best interest of individual investors.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-258">Initially, the SEC was unable to develop such a rule, and in 2016 the Department of Labor took action. The U.S.<span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-departmentoflabor" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-92" role="doc-glossref"> Department of Labor (DOL)</span> is a federal administrative agency whose mission is to foster and promote the welfare of job seekers, workers, and retirees. The <em>DOL rule</em>, sometimes called the <em>DOL fiduciary rule</em>, imposed a higher standard of conduct than did SEC and FINRA suitability rules by requiring financial professionals to provide advice considered to be in the best interest of the customer in regard to retirement plans and accounts. The DOL fiduciary rule was struck down in a 2018 court ruling, but generated increased awareness of investment advice standards.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-259">In response to this increased awareness, in 2019 the SEC voted to implement its Regulation Best Interest or Reg BI advice-standards package with an implementation deadline of June 30, 2020. <span class="gt" data-term="ch7-gt-regulationbestinterest" epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch7-span-93" role="doc-glossref">Regulation Best Interest</span> seeks to enhance the quality and transparency of individual investors’ relationships with broker-dealers and investment advisers. Reg BI requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to act in the best interest of individual investors when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities. It also requires broker-dealers and investment advisers to provide a Customer Relationship Summary (CRS) to potential clients to disclose services offered, the nature of the relationship, fees and costs, and conflicts of interest. The goal of Reg BI is to enhance the broker-dealer standard of conduct beyond suitability obligations and ensure that a financial professional does not put its financial interests ahead of the interests of a customer when making recommendations.</p>

<p class="txt" id="loma311-ch7-p-260">At the time of this writing, several groups had challenged or were considering challenging Reg BI in the courts. Also, a number of other stakeholders—such as the DOL, the NAIC, and some states—were considering or had implemented alternate investment advice standards, some of which applied to variable life insurance and annuities.</p>

<h4 id="loma311-ch7-h4-10">Dispute Resolution</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-261">Sometimes disputes arise between broker-dealers and customers. Similarly, disputes arise between broker-dealers and registered persons. FINRA rules require broker-dealers to submit to arbitration when they are involved in all such disputes.</p>

<div class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch7-div-103">&#160;</div>

<h4 id="loma311-ch7-h4-11">Compliance Inspections</h4>

<p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch7-p-262">FINRA carries out its regulatory responsibilities by conducting periodic compliance inspections of all broker-dealers. The frequency of such inspections varies depending on the nature of the broker-dealer’s activities. Examiners review the broker-dealer’s records to ensure that all records are accurate and up-to-date. Examiners also review sales practices and the broker-dealer’s financial condition.</p>
