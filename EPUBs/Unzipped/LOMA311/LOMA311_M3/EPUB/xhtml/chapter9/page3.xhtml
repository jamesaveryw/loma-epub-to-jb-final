            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-26">A <em>group contract</em>, or group master contract, is a contract between
                an insurer and a group policyholder. The <em>group policyholder</em> is an
                employer or other party that purchases insurance coverage, according to
                the terms of the contract, for a number of people known as <em>group insureds</em>.
                The insureds have a defined relationship to the group policyholder. For
                instance, they may be employees of an employer, members of a union, or
                debtors who have borrowed money from a lender.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-27">The contracting parties to a group life insurance contract are the group
                policyholder and the insurer. Although the insureds are not a party to
                the group life insurance contract, they do have legally enforceable rights
                under the contract. In the United States, most state laws do <em>not</em> require
                that insureds receive a copy of the group contract, but the laws do require
                that each insured receive a written description of the group life insurance
                plan. Every insured must receive a <em>certificate of coverage</em>, also
                called a <em>certificate of insurance</em>, which is a document that describes
                the insured’s coverage and outlines the insured’s rights under the group
                master contract. Some states also require that insureds have access to
                the group contract.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-28">The group contract and certificate of insurance are integral parts of
                the contract. Sometimes information in the group contract conflicts with
                information in the certificate of insurance. Under the general rules of
                contract construction, ambiguities in an insurance contract are construed
                against the party that drafted the contract. Thus, when information in
                the group contract conflicts with information in the certificate of insurance,
                the disparity is considered an ambiguity and will be construed against
                the insurer and in favor of the insured.</p>

            <h3 id="loma311-ch9-h3-1">Formation of the Contract</h3>
            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-29">A group life insurance contract is an informal contract that must meet
                the formation requirements for informal contracts described in Chapter
                4. The parties to a group insurance contract must (1) mutually assent to
                the contract, (2) exchange legally adequate consideration, (3) have contractual
                capacity, and (4) meet the lawful purpose requirement. With the exception
                of the lawful purpose requirement, these requirements are met in the same
                manner for both group and individual life insurance contracts.</p>
            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-30">The lawful purpose requirement is met in a group life insurance contract
                when the group policyholder enters into the contract to provide benefits
                to covered group members. To enter into a valid group life insurance contract,
                the group policyholder must represent a group that is eligible for group
                insurance. For individual life insurance contracts, as we show in Chapter
                10, the lawful purpose requirement is met by the presence of an insurable
                interest. However, an insurable interest usually is not required for a
                group contract because the group policyholder’s interest in the contract
                does not induce wagering contracts as does a policyowner’s interest in
                an individual life insurance contract. Typically, the group policyholder
                does not stand to gain from an insured’s loss.</p>

            <h4 id="loma311-ch9-h4-1">Eligible Groups</h4>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-31">Group underwriters evaluate the purpose for a proposed group’s existence
                to make sure that the group was formed for purposes other than to obtain
                insurance. Such an evaluation is important because a group that was formed
                primarily to obtain insurance is likely to pose significant risk. In addition
                to looking at why the group was formed, underwriters look at the group’s
                characteristics, such as its stability, size, geographic location, nature
                of the business, age and sex of the group members, prior coverage, and
                claim experience. The goal of group life insurance underwriting is to cover
                a group of insureds who present similar underwriting risks and whose mortality
                experience is reasonably predictable. Rather than focus on the risk characteristics
                of individuals, group underwriters focus on the characteristics of the
                group as a whole.</p>

                This model act defines the types of groups that are eligible for group

                contracts must include. Note, however, that specific regulatory requirements
                vary by state.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-33">According to the Group Life Insurance Model Act, as well as most state
                insurance laws, insurers cannot deliver a group life insurance contract <em>unless</em> the
                contract insures one of several specified types of eligible groups. For
                each type of eligible group, the model act (1) identifies the party or
                parties that are permitted to be the group policyholder and (2) imposes
                requirements concerning the individuals who are eligible for coverage under
                the contract.</p>
            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-34">In some cases, a group contract may be issued by means of a trust. A

                role="doc-glossref">trust</span>is a fiduciary relationship created when one party, the <em>grantor</em>,
                    transfers ownership of property to another party, the <em>trustee</em>,
                    who holds legal title to the property for the benefit of another party,
                    the <em>trust beneficiary</em>. The property is known as the <em>trust property</em> or <em>trust fund</em>.

                    is to handle the trust property or trust fund. When insurance is issued
                    to the trustees of a trust fund, the trustees own the contract and have
                    a duty to manage the trust fund for the benefit of the insureds. In Chapter
                    12, we discuss the use of trusts in individual insurance.</p>

                        Although credit life insurance has many features of other group life insurance
                        products, it also has some unique features. One such distinction is that
                        credit insurance generally is not sold by traditional insurance agents
                        but by lenders. As a first step in setting up a credit insurance arrangement,
                        a lender enters into a contractual agreement with a credit insurer. Often,
                        the lending institution and the insurer are affiliated corporations within
                        a holding company system.</p>

                        borrowers. When a person applies for a loan, the lender offers the borrower
                        the opportunity to purchase credit insurance that will provide money to
                        repay all or part of the debt if the borrower dies or becomes disabled
                        before repaying the loan. As the borrower pays down the loan, the amount
                        of life insurance decreases.</p>

                                    must disclose that it cannot require the debtor to purchase credit insurance
                                    as a condition of obtaining approval of the loan.</li>

                    <p id="loma311-ch9-p-66">Before issuing a group contract to an eligible group, an insurer must
                        determine the <em>regulatory jurisdiction</em>, also known as the <em>situs</em>,
                        for the contract. The regulatory jurisdiction determines the applicable
                        state insurance requirements. The parties to a group contract can decide
                        where the insurer will deliver the contract to the group policyholder for
                        purposes of establishing regulatory jurisdiction. State laws, however,
                        require that the parties select a place that has a reasonable basis for
                        delivery of the contract. Video 9.1 shows the criteria states use to determine

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-75">The group policyholder is responsible for remitting premiums to the insurer,
                        usually on a monthly basis. Typically, premiums are due prior to the period
                        of coverage. Whether insureds must pay all or part of the cost of these
                        premiums depends on if the plan is contributory or noncontributory.</p>

                        the insureds pay all or part of the premiums for their coverage. When a
                        plan is contributory, eligible group members must be given the choice of
                        whether to participate, and they must authorize the payment of their premium
                        contributions, typically as a payroll deduction. Insurers commonly require
                        group policyholders to pay at least part of the premiums for group life
                        insurance. Such a requirement, which is imposed by law in many states,
                        helps to reduce the insureds’ insurance costs, and thus tends to increase
                        participation in the plan.</p>
                        <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-77">For contributory plans, group insurers often have a <em>minimum participation requirement</em> to

                            likely to have claims to be the people most likely to apply for insurance.
                            Insurers usually require that at least 75 percent of eligible group members
                            participate in a contributory plan.</p>

                                    or the insureds shall be deemed representations and not warranties. An
                                    entire contract provision also says that no statement made by an insured
                                    shall be used in any contest unless a copy of the document containing the
                                    statement has been provided to the insured. If the insured is deceased

                                    to the insurer in order to obtain part or all of her coverage. We discuss
                                    some of these conditions later in the chapter. When an insured is required
                                    to provide evidence of insurability, that evidence generally is documented
                                    in a questionnaire included in or attached to the group member’s enrollment
                                    form (described below). If an insured makes material misrepresentations
                                    of fact in providing evidence of insurability, the insurer has the right
                                    to contest the insured’s coverage during the contestable period shown in
                                    the contract and certificate of insurance. Note that a material misrepresentation
                                    by an insured does not affect the validity of the group contract; it affects
                                    only the validity of the coverage on the particular insured.</p>

                            employees, or employees who work at specified locations. Most contracts

                                    period ends is considered a <em>late entrant</em>. A late entrant generally
                                    must provide satisfactory evidence of insurability to enroll for group
                                    insurance coverage. However, evidence of insurability is not required when

                                    a specified period of time, which typically occurs annually, during which
                                    group members may enroll for coverage or change existing coverage without
                                    providing evidence of insurability. In addition, a group member may enroll
                                    for coverage or change existing coverage without providing evidence of
                                    insurability during a <em>special enrollment period</em>, which occurs at
                                    the time of a specified life event, such as marriage or the birth of a

                                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-112">Each person insured under a group life insurance contract has the right
                                        to name the beneficiary who will receive the proceeds payable under the
                                        contract. The insured may name as the beneficiary an individual, the insured’s
                                        estate, a corporation, a charitable organization, or any other entity.
                                        Because most employer plans are subject to ERISA, which requires that plan
                                        assets be used for the benefit of the plan participants, an insured generally
                                        cannot name the group policyholder as the beneficiary. However, in some
                                        cases, such as for a debtor-creditor group or corporate-owned life insurance,
                                        the group policyholder is the beneficiary.</p>

                                                death benefit is used to reduce or extinguish the insured’s unpaid indebtedness

                                                the employer owns, pays the premiums for, and is the beneficiary of life
                                                insurance on one or more employees. COLI can be used for various reasons.
                                                For instance, an employer may insure the lives of key employees as a way
                                                to help offset the cost of finding and training a replacement for a person
                                                who is essential to the company’s success. This type of insurance is called <em>key person life insurance</em>.
                                                COLI can also be used to help fund employee benefits, such as retiree health
                                                insurance. In this case, the employer insures a large number of employees
                                                and uses the cash value and death benefits to pay for employee benefits.
                                                If the life insurance is purchased by a trust, the insurance is called <em>trust-owned life insurance</em> or <em>TOLI</em>.</p>

                                    <p id="loma311-ch9-p-115">Most group life insurance contracts give the insured the right to change
                                        the beneficiary. When a new beneficiary is named, the prior beneficiary’s
                                        right to receive the proceeds payable under the contract is revoked. A
                                        beneficiary designation is revocable if the insured has the unrestricted

                                            has no legal interest in the proceeds of a contract nor any involvement
                                            with the contract until after the death of the insured. During the insured’s
                                            lifetime, a revocable beneficiary cannot prevent an insured from exercising
                                            ownership rights. We discuss beneficiaries in more detail in Chapter 11.</p>

                                            insurance contracts, the <em>group policyholder</em> can exercise its right
                                            to terminate the contract by giving the insurer written notice of termination
                                            at least a specified number of days prior to the termination date. The
                                            notice usually must be given at least 31 days prior to termination.</p>

                                            insurance contract. For example, as we saw earlier, group insurers often
                                            establish minimum participation requirements to guard against antiselection.
                                            Group contracts usually state that at least 75 percent of eligible group
                                            members must participate in a contributory plan. If a group’s participation
                                            level falls below the required minimum, the insurer has the right to terminate
                                            the group contract on a premium due date. In such situations, the insurer
                                            must give the group policyholder written notice of termination, which usually
                                            must come 31 days prior to the date of termination.</p>
                                            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-119">An insurer may terminate a group life insurance contract for nonpayment
                                                of premium at the end of any grace period. The coverage provided by a group
                                                life insurance contract remains in effect during the grace period, unless
                                                the group policyholder has notified the insurer that it has elected to
                                                discontinue coverage in accordance with the terms of the group contract.
                                                If the group policyholder does not pay the renewal premium by the end of

                                                that if a contract terminates for nonpayment of premium, the group policyholder
                                                must pay the premium for the coverage provided during the grace period.
                                                In contrast, the grace period provision in an individual life insurance
