            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-191">Most group retirement plans in the United States are qualified plans.

                id="loma311-ch9-span-52" role="doc-glossref">qualified plan</span> is a
                group retirement plan that receives favorable federal income tax treatment
                because it meets specified requirements included in ERISA and federal tax
                laws. Tax laws provide incentives that apply to plan sponsors as well as
                plan participants. A qualified retirement plan can be structured in one
                of two ways.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-192">A <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-definedbenefitplan" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma311-ch9-span-53" role="doc-glossref">defined benefit plan</span> is
                a type of retirement plan that uses a formula to determine the benefit
                amount that each plan participant will receive during retirement. The defined
                benefit formula may be based on the employee’s pay and/or years of service
                and usually is described in terms of a monthly benefit. Under a defined
                benefit plan, the plan sponsor must contribute enough assets to the plan
                to provide the promised benefits.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-193">Most defined benefit plans are structured as a <span class="gt" data-term="ch9-gt-pensionplan"

                which is an arrangement under which a plan sponsor provides plan participants

                id="loma311-ch9-span-55" role="doc-glossref">defined contribution plan</span> is
                a type of group retirement plan that is funded by contributions from the
                plan sponsor and/or plan participants and specifies the annual contribution
                that the plan sponsor will deposit into the plan on behalf of each plan
                participant, if applicable. The plan participants and plan sponsor can
                deduct their contributions from their taxable income, subject to limits.
                Contributions are allocated to each plan participant’s account and invested
                and accumulated on behalf of the participant. The retirement benefit is
                based on the total amount in the participant’s account at retirement. The
                plan structure determines (1) if plan sponsor contributions are mandatory
                or voluntary, (2) if plan participants make contributions, and (3) how
                benefits are paid.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-195">The most common defined contribution plan is the <em>401(k) plan</em>,
                which permits a certain type of employer group to establish a retirement
                plan for its employees. The term <em>401(k)</em> comes from the section of
                the Internal Revenue Code that defines this type of group. Figure 9.3 shows
                examples of defined contribution plans and their features.</p>

                the United States. The ERISA administrative, fiduciary, and plan documentation
                requirements we described earlier in this chapter apply to qualified retirement
                plans as well as welfare benefit plans. In addition, qualified retirement

                        discriminate in favor of employees who are defined as highly compensated.
