            <h2 epub:type="title" id="loma311-ch9-h2-5">Federal Regulation of Group Products</h2>
            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-150">In the United States, group products are subject to both state and federal
                regulation. In this section, we describe a few of the federal laws that
                apply to group insurance and group retirement plans. As we saw in Chapter
                3, U.S. federal employment laws have been enacted to ensure that all employees
                are treated fairly in the workplace. Employment laws prohibit discrimination
                regarding hiring, advancement, wages, and other terms and conditions of
                employment, such as employee benefits. Employer-sponsored plans that provide
                group life insurance and retirement plans must comply with all applicable
                federal employment-related laws. Three such laws are ADEA, ADA, and ERISA.</p>
            <div
            class="clearfix" id="loma311-ch9-div-75">&#160;</div>
                <h3 id="loma311-ch9-h3-6">ADEA</h3>
                <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-151">The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) is a federal law that
                    protects workers who are age 40 and older from being discriminated against
                    because of their age. The ADEA applies to employers with 20 or more employees.
                    Because the cost of providing group life insurance benefits to older workers
                    is greater than the cost of providing the same benefits to younger workers,
                    older workers are at risk of experiencing discrimination regarding employee
                    benefits. The ADEA seeks to protect older workers from this type of discrimination.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-152">The ADEA permits employers to reduce the level of certain group life insurance
                    benefits so that the cost to the employer of providing these benefits to
                    older workers is no greater than the cost of providing the full benefits
                    to younger workers. For example, the life insurance benefit might be reduced
                    to 65 percent at age 65 if the actual amount of payment made or cost incurred
                    on behalf of the 65-year-old is no less than that made or incurred on behalf
                    of a younger worker. In other words, the ADEA requires that an employer’s
                    premium contributions for benefits provided to older workers be at least
                    equal to the employer’s premium contributions for benefits provided to
                    younger workers.</p>

                    <h3 id="loma311-ch9-h3-7">ADA</h3>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-153">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that protects
                        people with disabilities against all types of discrimination, including
                        employment discrimination. The ADA requires that people with disabilities
                        have equal access to the same group life insurance benefits available to
                        other employees. The ADA allows benefit limitations but prohibits the denial
                        or limitation of benefits based solely on the fact that a person has a
                        disability. A health-related distinction in a benefit plan is a prohibited
                        disability-based limitation if it singles out a particular disability,
                        a discrete group of disabilities, or disability in general.</p>

                    <h3 id="loma311-ch9-h3-8">ERISA</h3>
                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-154">Most employer-sponsored group insurance plans and retirement plans in
                        the United States must comply with the <em>Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)</em>,
                        which, as we saw in Chapter 7, is a federal law designed to ensure that
                        retirement and welfare benefit plans meet certain minimum plan requirements.
                        ERISA does not require employers to establish a plan. However, if an employer
                        does establish a plan, then in most cases the plan must comply with ERISA.
                        The purpose of ERISA’s minimum plan requirements is to safeguard the benefits
                        of covered employees and group members.</p>
                    <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch9-p-155">Although ERISA includes “retirement income security” in its title, the
                        law applies to many types of employee benefits in addition to retirement
                        plans. In this section, we describe ERISA requirements that apply to both
                        retirement and welfare benefit plans. Later in this chapter, we describe
                        ERISA requirements that apply only to retirement plans.</p>
                    <p class="txt"
                    id="loma311-ch9-p-156">Under ERISA, a <em>welfare benefit plan</em> is a plan that an employer
                        establishes to provide specified benefits to plan participants and their
                        beneficiaries. One such benefit is a death benefit provided by life insurance
                        coverage. For ERISA purposes, a welfare benefit plan is a plan that an
                        employer establishes to provide any of the benefits to plan participants
                        and their beneficiaries that are shown in Figure 9.1.</p>

                    <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch9-p-171">Typically, administrative duties under an ERISA plan are performed by
                        plan administrators. The plan sponsor must name a plan administrator, who
                        may be a specified individual or a committee formed for the purpose of
                        handling the plan’s administrative needs. The plan administrator may work
                        with a third party to help ensure that the plan operates according to its
                        terms. For instance, for group life insurance plans, plan sponsors usually
                        contract with insurance companies to provide much of the plan administration.
                        Similarly, for retirement plans, many plan sponsors contract with financial
                        services firms that provide administrative services, such as accounting,
                        actuarial, disbursement, and reporting services. For ERISA purposes, however,
                        the plan sponsor is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the plan complies
                        with all applicable laws and regulations. Plan administrators may perform
                        some or all of the following duties:</p>

                    <h4 id="loma311-ch9-h4-10">ERISA Plan Fiduciaries</h4>
                    <p id="loma311-ch9-p-176">Under ERISA, fiduciary duties encompass a broad range of activities and
                        may include both administrative duties and asset management duties. ERISA
                        requires each welfare benefit plan and retirement plan to name one or more
                        plan fiduciaries in its plan document. Typically, the named plan fiduciary
                        is either the plan sponsor or the plan administrator. The purpose of requiring
                        a named fiduciary is to give plan participants the name of at least one
                        person who is responsible for the administration and operation of the plan.
                        This requirement, however, does not limit fiduciary responsibility to the
                        fiduciary named in the plan document. According to ERISA, other unnamed
                        persons may be considered fiduciaries if they perform any of the following
                        duties:</p>
                    <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch9-ul-15">

                                plan or over assets held under the plan</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch9-li-73">
                            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-178">Exercising any discretionary authority or responsibility in the administration
                                of the plan</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch9-li-74">
                            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-179">Rendering investment advice for direct or indirect compensation</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="loma311-ch9-p-180">Fiduciaries have a duty to act solely in the interest of plan participants
                        and plan beneficiaries. They must act for the exclusive purpose of providing
                        plan benefits and defraying reasonable administrative expenses. According
                        to ERISA, fiduciaries must use the same care, skill, prudence, and diligence
                        that a prudent person who is familiar with such matters would use under
                        the circumstances. Plan fiduciaries who fail to perform their fiduciary
                        duty can be held personally liable for any losses or unreasonable expenses
                        that result from a breach of that duty. In some cases, criminal penalties
                        can be imposed on plan fiduciaries.</p>
                    <p id="loma311-ch9-p-181">In addition to being held personally liable for any breach caused by his
                        own actions, a plan fiduciary can be held liable for the breach of another
                        fiduciary, who, in this context, is referred to as a <em>cofiduciary</em>.
                        When a fiduciary discovers the breach of a cofiduciary, he must take steps
                        to correct the situation, which may include suing the cofiduciary if necessary.
                        A fiduciary will usually be held liable for the breach of a cofiduciary
                        in the following situations:</p>
                    <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch9-ul-16">

                            <p id="loma311-ch9-p-183">The fiduciary has knowledge of a breach by a cofiduciary and does not
