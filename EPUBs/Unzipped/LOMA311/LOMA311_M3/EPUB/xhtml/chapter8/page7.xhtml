            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-167">Many countries have laws designed to protect the privacy of their citizens,
                and privacy plays an important role in many insurance activities. Insurers
                develop and adhere to policies and procedures to safeguard information

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-170">Many states have laws that establish guidelines for insurers to follow
                as they collect, use, and disclose personal information about consumers.
                These laws often are based on the NAIC<span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-insuranceinformationandprivacyprotectionmodelact"
                epub:type="glossref" id="loma311-ch8-span-54" role="doc-glossref"> Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Model Act (Model Privacy Act)</span>.
                The Model Privacy Act sets standards for transactions involving insurance
                for personal, family, or household needs. For purposes of the Model Privacy
                Act, an <em>insurance transaction</em> is one in which an insurer either
                services a policy or determines a person’s eligibility for insurance coverage
                or benefits. Laws based on the Model Privacy Act apply to (1) insurers,
                (2) insurance agents, and (3) insurance support organizations that collect
                information about individuals and provide that information to insurers
                and insurance agents.</p>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-171">Under certain circumstances, the Model Privacy Act requires an insurer
                to provide a consumer who has applied for insurance (or a policy renewal
                or reinstatement) with a written notice of the insurer’s information practices.
                This notice is required when the insurer (1) intends to collect information
                about the consumer and (2) will collect that information from sources <em>other than</em> public
                records or the consumer, such as from a medical professional or a consumer
                reporting agency. The Model Privacy Act also:</p>
            <ul class="list" id="loma311-ch8-ul-22">
                <li id="loma311-ch8-li-80">
                    <p id="loma311-ch8-p-172">Limits the situations in which an insurer, insurance agent, or insurance
                        support organization has the right to disclose personal or privileged information
                        about consumers</p>
                </li>
                <li id="loma311-ch8-li-81">
                    <p id="loma311-ch8-p-173">Gives individuals whose personal information has been collected in connection
                        with an insurance transaction the right to (1) have access to that information
                        and (2) have the insurer amend or delete incorrect information from its
                        records</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-174">In addition, the Model Privacy Act imposes requirements on insurers when
                they make adverse underwriting decisions. For purposes of the act, an adverse
                underwriting decision is (1) a declination of coverage, (2) a termination
                of coverage, or (3) an offer to insure at higher than standard premium
                rates. When an insurer makes an adverse underwriting decision, the insurer
                must provide the proposed insured, applicant, or policyowner with the reasons
                for the decision and a summary of the individual’s right to have access
                to personal information held by the insurer.</p>

            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-175">Federal law seeks to protect consumers’ financial privacy by limiting
                when financial firms, including insurers, may disclose a consumer's nonpublic
                personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. A <em>nonaffiliated third party</em> is
                an entity that is not related by common ownership or control with the financial
                firm. <span class="gt" data-term="ch8-gt-nonpublicpersonalinformation" epub:type="glossref"
                id="loma311-ch8-span-55" role="doc-glossref">Nonpublic personal information</span> is
                personally identifiable information about a consumer that is not publicly
                available. Publicly available information generally may be shared without
                restriction. Information is publicly available if a financial firm reasonably
                believes the information is available to the general public from government
                records, widely distributed media, or disclosures required by law.</p>
            <p
            class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-176">If a consumer can take steps to prevent information from being made publicly
                available, then a financial firm must determine whether the consumer has
                taken such steps. For example, if a consumer has an unlisted telephone
                number, then the number is not publicly available and is protected information.
                Thus, insurers must identify the nonpublic information they have about
                consumers and take steps to protect that information.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch8-p-177">Financial firms must have policies and procedures for sharing information
                    with nonaffiliated third parties. Subject to several important exceptions,
                    before sharing nonpublic personal information about a consumer with certain
                    nonaffiliated third parties, a financial firm must (1) notify the consumer
                    of the firm’s privacy policies and (2) provide the consumer with an opportunity
                    to opt out of information sharing with such third parties.</p>
                <p class="txt"
                id="loma311-ch8-p-178">Furthermore, when a financial firm enters into a continuing customer relationship
                    with a consumer, the firm must give the consumer a notice about its privacy
                    policies. A continuing customer relationship is established, for example,
                    when a consumer purchases an insurance policy from an insurer. In this
                    case, the insurer must provide an initial privacy notice to the consumer
                    when the relationship is established. The insurer also must provide an
                    annual privacy notice for as long as the customer relationship continues.</p>
                <p
                class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-179">Federal laws restrict how a financial firm shares information with nonaffiliated
                    third parties. As a general rule, a financial firm is permitted to disclose
                    nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party (either directly
                    or through an affiliate) only after the firm has taken the following steps:</p>

                                may be disclosed to such a third party; this notice may be given via a
                                paper document or electronically</p>
                        </li>
                        <li id="loma311-ch8-li-83">
                            <p id="loma311-ch8-p-181">Given the consumer an opportunity to opt out of the disclosure by directing
                                that the insurer not disclose the information</p>

                            is necessary to enable a nonaffiliated third party to perform services
                            on behalf of the financial firm, then the firm is permitted to disclose
                            such information to the third party <em>without giving customers an opportunity to opt out</em>.
                            In such cases, the firm must (1) fully disclose to the customer that the
                            information is going to be provided and (2) obtain a contractual commitment
                            from the third party to maintain the confidentiality of the information.</p>

                            <p class="txt-ni" id="loma311-ch8-p-186">In many countries, the laws that regulate how companies collect, use,
                                and disclose personal information about individual consumers are not as
                                strict as the U.S. requirements. For instance, some countries require companies
                                to protect consumer information, but do not impose specific rules on how
                                companies must fulfill that requirement.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-187">Other countries have privacy requirements that are stricter than U.S.
                                requirements. Perhaps the most stringent requirements are in the European
                                Union (EU). The EU’s <em>Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications</em> seeks
                                to ensure the free flow of information while protecting the privacy of
                                personal information. The EU Directive requires providers of publicly available
                                electronic communications services to take specific steps to safeguard
                                the security of their services and ensure the privacy of electronically
                                transmitted information.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-188">The EU Directive established independent government data protection agencies
                                and requires registration of databases with those agencies. In some cases,
                                the Directive requires prior approval before personal data processing may
                                begin.</p>
                            <p class="txt" id="loma311-ch8-p-189">Notably, the EU Directive prohibits the transfer of personal information
                                from the EU to a non-EU country unless the non-EU country provides adequate
